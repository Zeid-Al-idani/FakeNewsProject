"b'Born and raised in the Philippines, Lea Salonga grew up watching Disney movies and listening to Disney storybook tapes. Never did she imagine, though, that she would grow up to be a real-life, bona fide Disney Princess.\n\nThen, after earning a Tony Award for her portrayal of Kim in the Broadway musical \xe2\x80\x9cMiss Saigon\xe2\x80\x9d in 1991, Salonga landed the career break of a lifetime: to be the singing voice of Princess Jasmine in the 1992 hit Disney film \xe2\x80\x9cAladdin.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSix years later, she got a second chance to live her young girl\xe2\x80\x99s dream as she performed the vocals of Mulan in the 1998 Disney film of that name.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never thought when I was 5 and listening to \xe2\x80\x98Cinderella\xe2\x80\x99 stories that I\xe2\x80\x99d be a Disney princess. I think it\xe2\x80\x99s such a magical thing to happen in my life, and for it to happen twice is something I would never have thought could happen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Salonga in a recent phone interview.\n\nSalonga\xe2\x80\x99s distinctive voice will return to Southern California for concerts tonight at the Valley Performing Arts Center in Northridge and Saturday at Segerstrom Center for the Arts. Backed by a four-piece band, Salonga will perform a selection of well-known songs, including her greatest hits from her various musicals and films.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe made sure to choose a fun program that the band is going to dig playing and I\xe2\x80\x99m going to love singing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Salonga, \xe2\x80\x9cand because we are having so much fun onstage, I hope that translates to the audience as well.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSalonga is keeping the program\xe2\x80\x99s song selections a secret for now, until she and her musical director decide on the set list; however, she promises all of the tunes will be familiar and fit her vocal range. Some of the songs, she added, will be making their California debut.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis will be the first time for California audiences to hear these songs, but there is nothing unknown or out of left field; stuff that always makes sense with my voice.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nA regular feature of Salonga\xe2\x80\x99s solo concerts is an audience participation segment, in which she chooses someone to join her onstage to sing the Grammy and Academy Award-winning duet \xe2\x80\x9cA Whole New World\xe2\x80\x9d from \xe2\x80\x9cAladdin.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo need to panic; we always have a lyric sheet so anyone who dares to come up doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have to have it memorized fully,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI want them to have fun.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSalonga has numerous Broadway credits, including her role as Eponine in the 1993 \xe2\x80\x9cLes Mis\xc3\xa9rables\xe2\x80\x9d Broadway run and as Fantine in the 2006 Broadway revival. She recently came off Broadway in the new musical \xe2\x80\x9cAllegiance,\xe2\x80\x9d which also starred George Takei and Telly Leung.\n\nSplitting her time between the U.S. and Manila, Salonga is a coach on the Philippine version of the television show \xe2\x80\x9cThe Voice.\xe2\x80\x9d In addition to her onscreen and onstage career, she has released several solo albums, including \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d Like to Teach the World to Sing\xe2\x80\x9d (1997) and \xe2\x80\x9cBy Heart\xe2\x80\x9d (1999).\n\nOn this tour, Grammy-nominated bass player Trey Henry and drummer Ray Brinker, both from the jazz group Tierney Sutton Band, will back Salonga.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI get to go up onstage with musicians who I really admire and respect, and just have a great time with,\xe2\x80\x9d Salonga said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s thrilling when I get to perform stuff where I can just emotionally let go and fly off to another world in my mind, and the audience gets to ride on that too.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nContact the writer: jmoe@ocregister.com'"
"b'We love all the Disney Princesses, but we\'re all about Girl Power and some princesses are just more badass than others. On the power girl scale, here\'s how your fave Disney Princesses rank.\n\n13. Aurora, Sleeping Beauty\n\nThe most interesting thing about her is that she sleeps, for a really long time! The story\'s a bit of a snooze, literally.\n\n12. Snow White, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\n\nSnow White started the whole ""I\'ll just rest my eyes until prince charming comes along"" trend, which just prevents her, and the other damsels in distress, from living up to their full potential. Plus, lying around waiting for some dude to come rescue you? Lame! At least she taught us to never take food from strangers.\n\n11. Cinderella, Cinderella\n\nFrom her evil stepsisters to her even more evil stepmother, Cinderella just can\'t seem to catch a break. We sympathize with Cinders, but we wouldn\'t have blamed her for teaching her evil step siblings a lesson or two!\n\n10. Ariel, Little Mermaid\n\nWhile we love Ariel\'s adventurous side, does it not bother anyone else how much she was willing to give up for Prince Eric? Meanwhile, he was ready to marry the first girl who sang him a pretty tune. It\'s time to reevaluate your life when the crab makes better decisions than you do!\n\n9. Jasmine, Aladdin\n\nOur favorite thing about Jasmine is that her and Aladdin take turns rescuing each other. Still, girl can be super judge-y. We respect that she isn\'t ""a prize to be won,"" but she doesn\'t give anyone a chance because she thinks all the princes are show-offs\xe2\x80\x94until someone shows up on a magic carpet, which sounds a little show off-y to us...\n\n8. Merida, Brave\n\nMerida gets props for wanting to do things her own way, and her bow and arrow skills give us a total Katniss vibe. Okay, so she did turn her mom into a bear and all, but she realized she was wrong and changed her back. That counts for something, right?\n\n7. Elsa, Frozen\n\nElsa\'s the only other Disney princess (then queen) that has magical powers. Unfortunately, it takes her almost hurting her own sister to realize that being different can be good thing.\n\n6. Rapunzel, Tangled\n\nRapunzle spends the first 18 years of her life locked in a castle, and yet she still learned how to wield a weapon (a frying pan, but hey, it still counts!) like a trained professional.\n\n5. Belle, Beauty and the Beast\n\nBelle is a small town girl who loves nothing more than to curl up with a good book. While she doesn\'t have magic powers or serious fighting skills like some of the other princesses, she manages to show the beast there\'s beauty in kindness. And unlike some of the other damsels on this list, she rescues her prince from an evil spell!\n\n4. Pocahontas, Pocahontas\n\nYes, she made a sacrifice for love, but it was deeper than that. Pocahontas managed to create peace and understanding between two feuding groups. Plus, she can paint with all the colors of the wind, so there\'s that.\n\n3. Tiana, The Princess and the Frog\n\nTiana is the first and only princess who not only has a full-time job, but starts her own business, too! She proves that with hard work and determination, nothing, even turning into a frog, can stand in your way.\n\n2. Anna, Frozen\n\nAnna is goofy, outspoken, unstoppable and totally relatable. When everyone feared the worst, Anna looked for a solution, and proved that sometimes the most important love is the love for your family.\n\n1. Mulan, Mulan\n\nMulan is no one\'s damsel in distress, which makes her the most kick-butt princess of them all. She joins the army and no one finds her suspicious, because she\'s just as good, if not better, than everyone else. Oh yeah, she also saves her entire country. NBD.\n\nWhat do you think of our ranking? What would you change?

"b'Source: Angela George/CC BY-SA 3.0\n\nOne of my favorite guilty pleasures is Bravo\xe2\x80\x99s The Real Housewives franchise. Although my relationship with the show has been on-again/off-again due to the almost unbearable level of cat-fighting, I have probably not missed an episode since the show\xe2\x80\x99s inception in 2006. Over the years, I have followed the \xe2\x80\x9creal\xe2\x80\x9d lives of women across the nation from New York to Orange County as they publicly aired their dirty laundry. I\xe2\x80\x99ve delighted in their triumphs and sometimes even in their misfortunes. However, the rate of divorce for these Bravo-lebrities (i.e., someone who is famous for appearing on a Bravo TV show) is no matter.\n\nWe all know that divorce is prevalent in the United States, but what you may not know is that the divorce rate for The Real Housewives is up to double that of the general population. To be fair, this elevated rate is not limited to divorces that have occurred since joining the cast, but rather takes into account whether these women have ever been (before or after participating in the show). I will also add that certain casts are more prone to divorce (for example, the Atlanta ladies) than others (such as the New Jersey Housewives).\n\nWhy are these women more likely to divorce?\n\nThere are a host of explanations as to why The Real Housewives are more apt to divorce. For instance, there are issues, ranging from to , not to mention dysfunctional styles, low , and, for some, even . Quite likely, the and lack of privacy associated with the show exacerbate all of these pre-existing vulnerabilities. However, I believe there are situational issues that are contributing to the high rate of divorce. In particular, by focusing on the women, the show may inadvertently be altering relationship dynamics making them more volatile.\n\nDependence\n\nOne particularly important factor in determining relationship outcomes is dependence. How dependent an individual is on his/her relationship is believed to be a function of available alternatives. When people perceive desirable alternatives to their current relationship (be it another partner or just another way of life) they are less dependent on their relationship. Conversely, when there are few alternatives available, people report greater relationship dependence, and by extension greater commitment.\n\nGenerally, when the viewing public meets a new Real Housewives cast member, she is a devoted and dependent wife. These women have often chosen to support their husband\xe2\x80\x99s pursuits and as a result are relatively reliant on their men, financially and otherwise. Then, as the show progresses an interesting thing happens. The women begin to gain a sense of independence. In some cases, this liberation may stem from their growing fame or economic prosperity. Other times, the autonomy inherent in a new group of friends (i.e., social support) may form the foundation of their newly found independence. In either case, they begin to envision a life or a lifestyle that is different from what they currently have and this usually becomes a source of friction.\n\nLet\xe2\x80\x99s take for instance the of Tamra and Simon from the Real Housewives of Orange County. When Tamra joined the show, she was a self-proclaimed trophy wife who proudly accepted the fact that her husband was not only the bread-winner, but also the decision maker of their relationship. However, over her years, the show appeared to give her options for supporting herself outside of her marriage and viewers watched her embrace her new found freedom. Unfortunately, her autonomy came at a price. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t long before her changing dependence and shifting priorities created a strain on her marriage, bringing an end to her more than ten year union with Simon.\n\nPower\n\nA related dynamic often altered by the TV show is power. The Principle of Lesser Interest states that the partner who has the least interest in continuing the relationship has more power. And often, it is the person who is the least dependent on the relationship that holds the power position. Before joining the show, the Housewives likely had less power in their relationships, as they often occupied the role of the more dependent partner. However, after becoming Bravo-lebrities they became less dependent and thus, had more power. Although that is not an inherently bad thing, this power shift can be an interesting obstacle to traverse, particularly if it is unanticipated. As a rule, most couples are looking for an equitable distribution of power. In fact, when couples feel that they are relatively egalitarian they show the greatest satisfaction, commitment, and success. However, the instant fame associated with being one of Bravo\xe2\x80\x99s Real Housewives necessarily disrupts a couple\xe2\x80\x99s status quo and can leave both partners feeling uncomfortable.\n\nI think the marriage of NeNe and Gregg from The Real Housewives of Atlanta, demonstrates the role that power can play in a relationship. When this couple met in 1996, Gregg was a real estate investor and NeNe was a stripper. Yet over her years on the show NeNe blossomed to become a successful actor, including roles on popular television shows such as, Glee, and on Broadway. NeNe\xe2\x80\x99s decreased dependence led to an increase in power. Unfortunately, this contributed to their divorce in 2010. Interestingly, as the partners stayed connected through their co- and , this couple was able to restore balance and ultimately remarried in 2013.\n\nIn Summary\n\nAspiring Housewives please take heed of this advice. Quite likely the show will bring you fame (or infamy, depending on your behavior), but you are also likely to stumble upon another consequence: the end of your marriage. Although divorce is not inevitable, let the failed marriages of Taylor, Camille, Adrienne, Luann, Bethenny, NeNe, Porsha, Phaedra, Tamra, Vicki, Jeana, Ramona, Dina, and most recently Cynthia and Jules be cautionary examples of how difficult the transition from a real life housewife to The Real Housewives can be.\n\nReferences\n\nBricker, T., & Nilles, B.

"b'James Woods has received a letter that he can now frame and put on his mantel shelf alongside his Emmy and Golden Globe awards.\n\nFrom attorney Kenneth White, the letter states, ""On behalf of my client \xe2\x80\x94 the defendant referred to as \'Abe List\' in the lawsuit filed by James Woods \xe2\x80\x94 and my client\'s surviving family, I acknowledge that they are not aware of any facts to suggest that Mr. Woods has ever been a cocaine addict or used any other drugs.""\n\nTo earn this, Woods filed a $10 million libel action in July 2015. The target in the lawsuit was an anonymous Twitter user who responded to Woods\' conservative politics by suggesting the actor was a ""cocaine addict."" In filing the lawsuit, Woods wanted to send a message. ""AL, and anyone else using social media to propagate lies and do harm, should take note,"" stated the complaint handled by Michael Weinsten at Lavely & Singer. ""They are not impervious to the law.""\n\nWoods then beat back an anti-SLAPP motion that attempted to make the argument that the ""cocaine addict"" tweet was ""a constitutionally protected political insult,"" the type made routinely by Woods as ""a well-known part of Twitter\'s culture of political hyperbole.""\n\nAn appeal abruptly was cut short when the defendant died. That wouldn\'t stop Woods. The actor wrote that he hoped the defendant died ""screaming my name,"" adding, ""Learn this. Libel me, I\'ll sue you. If you die, I\'ll follow you to the bowels of Hell. Get it?""\n\nWoods did make some efforts to pursue the defendant\'s estate, but that\'s all over now thanks to a settlement. Full terms hasn\'t been disclosed, but it does include White\'s letter.\n\n""To be clear, my client did not intend for his July 15, 2015 tweet about Mr. Woods to be understood as a statement of fact,"" the letter continues. ""He regretted having made the tweet, and further regrets any harm caused to Mr. Woods\' reputation by the tweet. His family was not aware of the tweet until after the fact and regrets if any harm came from the tweet being taken literally.""\n\nWoods is done with this Twitter defamation case, but the tables have turned because he\'s a defendant in another.\n\nPortia Boulger, an Ohio woman, is suing him for $3 million. She claims he misidentified her as a Nazi on Twitter. Specifically, the Chicago Tribune posted a photograph of a woman at a Donald Trump rally who might have been making a Nazi salute. Other Twitter users asserted it was Boulger, which led Woods to tweet the photograph along with a question: ""So-called #Trump \'Nazi\' is a #BernieSanders agitator/operative?""\n\nThis got retweeted by Donald Trump, Jr.\n\nStill in court over the matter, Woods filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings last month. He argued the case was an attempt to quell his free speech rights.\n\n""First, Plaintiff\'s claim for defamation fails as a matter of law because Mr. Woods\' allegedly defamatory question is not a statement of fact,"" writes Woods\' attorney. ""Nor would a reasonable reader interpret Mr. Woods\' question \xe2\x80\x94 seeking clarification \xe2\x80\x94 as inferring any factual content.""\n\nLater in the Woods\' brief, it\'s argues that the word ""Nazi"" is ""inherently imprecise and subject to myriad subjective interpretations"" and that ""several courts have consistently held that use of the term \'Nazi\' is rhetorical hyperbole.""'"
"b'Do you feel it in your fingers? Do you feel it in your toes?\n\nAs you may or may not have noticed, Christmas is all around us. \xe2\x80\x98Tis the season for novelty pop singles, for children\xe2\x80\x99s nativity plays, for office holiday parties, for happy reunions at airports, for Mariah Carey \xe2\x80\x94 in short, for Love Actually.\n\nRichard Curtis\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cultimate romantic comedy\xe2\x80\x9d has been charming viewers every holiday season (and a lot of other seasons, too, if we\xe2\x80\x99re being honest) since it first hit theaters in 2003. In the layered collection of loosely-connected love stories taking place over the weeks leading up to one Christmas in London, everybody has their own favorite Love Actually moment \xe2\x80\x94 from a politician\xe2\x80\x99s personal dance party to a controversial cue-card confession to \xe2\x80\x9cAre you from England?\xe2\x80\x9d But which of the film\xe2\x80\x99s nine narrative threads reigns supreme?\n\nWe\xe2\x80\x99ve put them all in order from worst to best, just because it\xe2\x80\x99s Christmas (and at Christmas you tell the truth). Check out our ranking, actually, below!\n\n9. Juliet, Peter, and Mark\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s cool that Keira Knightley, Andrew Lincoln, and Chiwetel Ejiofor all went on to be insanely famous and beloved. You know what\xe2\x80\x99s not cool? Every single thing about their storyline, especially those unforgivably creepy cue cards. The whole thing leaves a worse taste in my mouth than Juliet\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cterrible taste in pie.\xe2\x80\x9d How can Juliet and Mark never tell Peter about their weird little moment? How did Mark even fall in love with Juliet if he never deigned to have a conversation with her\xe2\x80\xa6 because he was already in love with her?! All the love that exists between this trio is built on secrets and lies. How do we all stand for it every Christmas? To me, this is not perfect.\n\n8. Harry and Karen (and Mia, I guess)\n\nHarry and Karen\xe2\x80\x99s love gone wrong has got to be the most crushing story in the movie because while there\xe2\x80\x99s still hope for Sarah\xe2\x80\x99s heart to mend, Karen knows that \xe2\x80\x9clife will always be a little bit worse\xe2\x80\x9d following the discovery of her husband\xe2\x80\x99s confirmed infidelity (and their subdued airport reunion at the end reinforces that realization). And if the image of Emma Thompson crying while listening to Joni Mitchell doesn\xe2\x80\x99t absolutely shatter your heart, I honestly have no idea what will.\n\n7. Sarah, Karl, and Michael\n\nThe attraction between Sarah and Karl is very underdeveloped, but I guess the gist is that Laura Linney\xe2\x80\x99s radiant goodness and Rodrigo Santoro\xe2\x80\x99s unreasonable handsomeness just inexorably drew them to each other until Karl finally asked Sarah to dance. Alas, while Sarah has probably the biggest heart of anyone in this whole movie filled with great big stupid hearts, there just isn\xe2\x80\x99t enough room in it for her to be both devoted to her brother Michael and to begin a relationship with beautiful, beautiful Karl. Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry, Sarah! Patrick Dempsey will be yours in 14 short years.\n\n6. Colin and the American girls\n\nWhen we first hear self-proclaimed \xe2\x80\x9cGod of Sex\xe2\x80\x9d Colin tell his friend Tony that he plans to cross the Atlantic to find a girlfriend \xe2\x80\x94 based on the infallible logic that no American girl will be able to resist his British accent \xe2\x80\x94 we accept it as a dumb clich\xc3\xa9 and brace ourselves for Colin\xe2\x80\x99s inevitable humiliation at the hands of all the smart American girls who will reject him. But no! It\xe2\x80\x99s got to be Love Actually\xe2\x80\x99s cleverest joke (if one of its rather shallower love stories) that Colin was absolutely right. Good thing that suitcase was chock-a-block full of condoms!\n\n5. John and Judy\n\nThe simplest, and one of the sweetest, love stories in Love Actually is that of John and \xe2\x80\x9cJust Judy,\xe2\x80\x9d who feel no awkwardness whatsoever as they nakedly simulate sex in their work together as body doubles, but blush and giggle and stutter their way through their shy flirtations. When Judy finally admits, \xe2\x80\x9call I want for Christmas\xe2\x80\xa6 is you!\xe2\x80\x9d it lacks the flash of some of the other romantic climaxes, but is no less filled with feeling.\n\n4. Jamie and Aur\xc3\xa9lia\n\nYes, their (sort of) bilingual proposal scene is adorable, but it\xe2\x80\x99s also pretty schmaltzy, capitalizing on that cheapest of rom-com setups, the declaration of love before an audience of strangers. (Really, was it necessary for Jamie to attract a whole parade of Aur\xc3\xa9lia\xe2\x80\x99s neighbors on his way to propose to her?) But it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to resist Colin Firth\xe2\x80\x99s broken Portuguese \xe2\x80\x94 or that soaring Love Actually score, played to greatest effect here.\n\n3. David and Natalie\n\nPrime Minister David and his household staffer Natalie first bond, in a quiet unspoken British way, over her tendency to curse and his taste for chocolate biscuits. His door-to-door search of her in \xe2\x80\x9cthe dodgy end\xe2\x80\x9d of Wandsworth is very charming, of course, but his greatest moment as a romantic hero is when he stands up to Billy Bob Thornton\xe2\x80\x99s sleazy American president (we get it, Love Actually, Americans have no class) at a press conference. Yes, he was talking about politics, but there\xe2\x80\x99s no way he would have spoken with such passion if he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t come to really hate POTUS for harassing Natalie.\n\n2. Billy Mack and Joe\n\nLove Actually knew that not all love stories had to be romantic a solid decade before Frozen hit us over the head with it! When rock & roll sellout Billy Mack figures out that his decades-old friendship with \xe2\x80\x9cmy fat manager\xe2\x80\x9d Joe means more to him than anything else, he delivers perhaps the movie\xe2\x80\x99s greatest confession of love: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a terrible, terrible mistake, Chubs, but you turned out to be the f\xe2\x80\x94ing love of my life.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n1. Daniel, Sam, and Joanna\n\nThe Christmas concert! The airport sprint! Love Actually\xe2\x80\x99s two greatest set pieces both belong to little Sam and his crush Joanna, and the movie\xe2\x80\x99s youngest heroes would probably earn the top spot on the merit of those scenes alone. But what makes their sweet love story really soar above the rest is how it\xe2\x80\x99s colored by the loss of Sam\xe2\x80\x99s mother at the beginning of the film, and how much Sam\xe2\x80\x99s pursuit of Joanna, assisted by his also-grieving stepfather Daniel, is about embracing and overcoming the \xe2\x80\x9ctotal agony\xe2\x80\x9d of love of all kinds. Finally, as additional confirmation that this storyline has been sprinkled with magic Christmas dust, Claudia Schiffer shows up at the end to date Daniel! Love actually is all around.'"

"b'A cursory glance at the Spring \xe2\x80\x9916 collections reveals that fashion is in the midst of a major shift. The minimalism that ruled the runways (and our wardrobes) for the better part of five years has been replaced by a cobbled-together, anything-goes sensibility; now more than ever, women are being encouraged to mix, match, and wear only what they love. To many of us, Gucci\xe2\x80\x99s glittering knits and Vetements\xe2\x80\x99s tablecloth boots are an invitation to get creative\xe2\x80\x94but to the uninitiated, it could all simply read as tacky. The concept of \xe2\x80\x9cgood\xe2\x80\x9d vs. \xe2\x80\x9cbad\xe2\x80\x9d taste has been of recent debate here in the Vogue offices\xe2\x80\x94how do you determine what\xe2\x80\x99s chic and what isn\xe2\x80\x99t? Or is some degree of tackiness the secret to inspired style?\n\nThe continued \xe2\x80\x9990s revival indicates the answer is yes\xe2\x80\x94and that counts for denim, too. Super-wide \xe2\x80\x9970s flares and faded Levi\xe2\x80\x99s 501s are great, but those looking to make a quieter, less literal statement may want to consider the oft-forgotten boot-cut jean. More curve-hugging than a flare but longer and leaner than a straight-leg, it nails the tricky middle ground between familiar and au courant. \xe2\x80\x9cThe boot-cut is back!\xe2\x80\x9d says Kelly Connor, Vogue.com\xe2\x80\x99s resident denim expert. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re flattering, lengthening, and perfect for those who aren\xe2\x80\x99t so into the full, high-rise flares we\xe2\x80\x99ve been seeing everywhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nJane Birkin Photo: Getty Images\n\nWhile images of denim icons like Fran\xc3\xa7oise Hardy and Jane Birkin instantly spring to mind, Connor\xe2\x80\x99s personal boot-cut muses might surprise you. \xe2\x80\x9cI love the boot-cut jeans of the early \xe2\x80\x9900s\xe2\x80\x94Britney Spears, Halle Berry, and all those glossy blondes from The Hills and Laguna Beach,\xe2\x80\x9d she says. \xe2\x80\x9cIn retrospect, Kristin Cavallari was quite chic and ahead of her time!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPerhaps boot-cut jeans are refreshing because they are considered a tad tacky. Or maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s because we haven\xe2\x80\x99t worn them in a while; chances are you\xe2\x80\x99ve got a pair tucked away in the back of your closet. Either way, there\xe2\x80\x99s no denying the thigh-slimming, rear-lifting powers of a fitted, dark-rinse, mid- or high-rise jean that kicks out just below the knee.

The account, @onionringsworldwide, seemed fairly new, with only four posts and 24 followers, including Lorde and a number of her friends.\n\nWhile @onionringsworldwide, whose bio read, \xe2\x80\x9cEvery onion ring I encounter, rated\xe2\x80\x9d, only had four posts, those four posts each gave plenty of clues leading back to Lorde, according to this 17-year-old fan. Like any good food Intagrammer, each caption included the name of the restaurant said onion ring was acquired from, and a review of the ring. That alone, plus knowing where Lorde is on her promotional tour (and knowing the look of her nails?), helped the fan build a strong case that this account was actually run by Lorde.\n\nEven more evidence that this account was run by non-Royal Lorde? Newshub reached out to her management and they didn\xe2\x80\x99t respond. Instead? The account has since been deleted.\n\nNewshub contacted Lorde\xe2\x80\x99s management to ask whether Lorde likes onion rings, whether she prefers a light batter on her onion rings, and whether she runs the account.\n\nManagement had not responded at the time of writing, but shortly after questions were sent through, we\xe2\x80\x99re sad to report the onionringsworldwide account was removed from Instagram.\n\nA few things about this: A) why does it matter if she secretly runs this innocent account? It\xe2\x80\x99s not going to effect her popularity. Why are they treating this like she ran a pro-life Instagram? B) why didn\xe2\x80\x99t her management give a statement or respond at all to Newshub? C) She reviewed a Burger King onion ring, and that just seems like a lost cause.\n\nListen, if Lorde wants to have some semblance of normality in her life, let her just have an anonymous account, maintaining it while she flies private between Bonaroo and Bev Hills. But she can\xe2\x80\x99t be the only celeb who has a secret social media account, right? I don\xe2\x80\x99t know for sure, but here are my best guesses as to what type of accounts these famous people are managing under the shroud of internet secrecy.\n\nEDIT: LORDE IS ON JIMMY FALLON AS I\xe2\x80\x99M WRITING THIS AND SHE CONFIRMED IT WAS HER ACCOUNT.\n\nShe said, \xe2\x80\x9cI sort of naively didn\xe2\x80\x99t realize it would be a thing.. it was like a good past time\xe2\x80\xa6 I deleted it because now people are going to be throwing onion rings (at me) on tour\xe2\x80\xa6 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think they get enough credit for how delicious they are.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nUgh.

But prosecutors said Lochte invented the story to cover up the swimmers' vandalism of a gas station and an ensuing confrontation with security guards.

Martin Bureau/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe initial claim appeared to confirm widespread fears before the Olympics that the event would be marred by rising crime rates in Rio de Janeiro, which has long struggled with violence. As Lochte's version of events began to shift, many Brazilians became annoyed that a false story about crime drew so much attention, when the city had hosted the Games without major problems.\n\nThe scandal drew international headlines and grew to overshadow the final days of the Games. Lochte ended up serving a 10-month suspension from the U.S. national swim team for his behavior.\n\nLast year, a court dismissed the case against Lochte, but the Superior Court of Justice reversed that decision Tuesday.

After all, doubters say, how could John and Patsy have known that their daughter died on Christmas Day if they didn\xe2\x80\x99t find her body until the early afternoon of the 26th? Surely the gravestone is evidence of their guilt that so many have long assumed, despite them being exonerated in 2008 by DNA evidence?\n\nThe few undisputed facts are as follows: just before 6am on 26 December, Patsy called the Boulder police department from her home. Her daughter had been taken from their home in the middle of the night, she said. She had found a two-and-a-half-page ransom note demanding $118,000 for her safe return. The police arrived at the Ramsey house, along with many of the Ramseys\xe2\x80\x99 friends, who wandered freely around the property. After the kidnappers failed to call at the promised time, one of the officers suggested to John that he look around the family\xe2\x80\x99s large house. He went down to the basement with a friend and there he saw his daughter, bound and gagged. When he brought her upstairs, it was obvious she had been dead for some time. She had been bashed over the head, strangled with a garrote fashioned out of a nylon cord and her mother\xe2\x80\x99s paintbrush, and possibly sexually assaulted. There was no immediately obvious sign of a break-in, and the house was so large, the perpetrator must have known its layout very well to have found JonBen\xc3\xa9t\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom in the middle of the night and taken her down to the basement without waking anyone else.\n\nSome historical crime stories fascinate the public years later because of what they say about the times in which they happened. The OJ Simpson case and the Manson killings are two obvious examples, both of which have experienced a revival of interest this year, thanks to their retelling in pop culture. The story of JonBen\xc3\xa9t Ramsey is different.\n\nThe case is certainly in the spotlight again, with three US networks \xe2\x80\x93 CBS, A&E and Investigation Discovery \xe2\x80\x93 all recently screening their takes on the case to varying degrees of tackiness. The media coverage of this case was, and remains, almost unparalleled in its tawdriness. Photos of the little girl\xe2\x80\x99s autopsy were bought and published by US tabloid the Globe. One journalist claimed to convert from Judaism to Christianity in order to attend the Ramsey\xe2\x80\x99s church and glean insights from staring at the back of John and Patsy\xe2\x80\x99s heads. (\xe2\x80\x9cI had never seen anyone pray for his own soul the way Patsy was praying for hers \xe2\x80\xa6 At that moment, I decided she was the killer,\xe2\x80\x9d the journalist, Jeff Shapiro, said in probably the best-known book about the case, Lawrence Schiller\xe2\x80\x99s Perfect Murder, Perfect Town.) The whole story has long been covered in a thick sheen of schlock. The only interesting thing about its historical context is that the case happened in the aftermath of the OJ Simpson trial, just when the media was desperately seeking another case that would similarly hold the public\xe2\x80\x99s attention.\n\nBut while JonBen\xc3\xa9t\xe2\x80\x99s murder may well never be solved, there has never been any mystery about why it still exerts such a fascination. Like Madeleine McCann, JonBen\xc3\xa9t was a pretty blond child from a well-off family, allowing the public the pleasure of looking at this photogenic child while simultaneously experiencing a quiet, unacknowledged frisson of schadenfreude at her parents\xe2\x80\x99 pain. Add to this the undeniably sexualised pageant photos, in which the six-year-old wiggled and pouted in a manner that looked all the more fascinatingly horrific after her brutal death, and you have the perfect made-for-media confection. But none of these factors really explains the passion this case excites.\n\nPretty much from the moment this story broke, there have been two theories about what happened: either JonBen\xc3\xa9t was killed accidentally by one or both of her parents, or her then nine-year-old brother, Burke, and the parents staged a faked kidnapping to cover up the killing; or it was a botched kidnapping by a mystery outsider. Part of the reason this case has never been solved is because the Boulder police department badly bungled the first few days. Understaffed during Christmas and wholly unprepared for such an extraordinary case, they failed to secure the crime scene. They didn\xe2\x80\x99t even find JonBen\xc3\xa9t\xe2\x80\x99s body in the basement, leaving John to do so hours later. Their relationship with the Ramseys completely broke down when they threatened to refuse to release JonBen\xc3\xa9t\xe2\x80\x99s body for burial unless the Ramseys came in for an interview, and there were frequent leaks from the Boulder police department to the media. \xe2\x80\x9cThe police were not there to help us. They were there to hang us,\xe2\x80\x9d John Ramsey has said since. A 2015 Reddit ask me anything (AMA) discussion with former Boulder police chief Mark Beckner did little to disprove the Ramseys\xe2\x80\x99 belief that the police continue to assume they were guilty. (Beckner has since expressed regret for the AMA, saying he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t realised it would be made public.)\n\nJonBen\xc3\xa9t Ramsey. This and other photographs of her competing in beauty pageants helped to turn the public against the family after her death. Photograph: Sipa Press/Rex Features\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe biggest mistake in this case is that there was a phenomenal number of people who decided on the first day that they knew what happened, and they would not allow new information to change that, and that boggles my mind,\xe2\x80\x9d says journalist and Boulderite, Charlie Brennan, who has been covering the story from its first days.\n\nHowever, it is understandable why the police suspected the Ramseys. When a child is killed at home, it is statistically likely that a parental figure was involved. The Ramseys, according to the police, were reluctant to be interviewed (the Ramseys have vociferously denied this), and John was overheard on the phone an hour after finding JonBen\xc3\xa9t making arrangements for his family to leave the state (he has since said he was just trying to keep them safe). They were also swift to hire lawyers \xe2\x80\x93 suspiciously quick in the eyes of many. As for the date on her gravestone, her parents have since said they chose it because that was the last time they saw their daughter.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Ramsey case is a criminal Rorschach test \xe2\x80\x93 every piece of evidence can be looked at in several ways, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen that in any other case,\xe2\x80\x9d says Brennan. One example of this is the weirdly long ransom letter, demanding a very specific amount of money, which happened to be almost exactly what John Ramsey had received as a bonus that year. Even weirder, the note was clearly written in the Ramseys\xe2\x80\x99 house, using a pad of paper and pen that were there. To some, this proves the Ramseys must have written it: what kidnapper would hang around to write such a long note? But to others, this is proof that they didn\xe2\x80\x99t. Why would the Ramseys mention John\xe2\x80\x99s bonus in the letter? It must have been someone with knowledge of his well-publicised business affairs who wanted to hurt him. The killer could have broken in while the family was out on Christmas Day visiting friends, their defenders say, and written the note while they were out, lying in wait until they went to sleep.\n\nThen there are the pageants. Without question, the images of the little girl sashaying on stage in makeup, which were released without her parents\xe2\x80\x99 consent, helped to turn public opinion against the Ramsey family. It certainly turned many people in Boulder against them.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBoulder sees itself as a very sophisticated community and a lot of people figured that this whole spectacle was beneath them,\xe2\x80\x9d says Brennan. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Ramseys had only moved to Boulder a few years earlier [from Georgia], and then the whole pageant thing came to light, which was something that was completely foreign to most people in Colorado and more associated with the deep south. So a lot of Boulderites felt: \xe2\x80\x98This does not reflect us, they are not one of us.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d As a result, Brennan says: \xe2\x80\x9cA lot of people in Boulder feel there is no mystery \xe2\x80\x93 they know who did it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nEven JonBen\xc3\xa9t\xe2\x80\x99s parents seemed divided about the pageant issue. In their book about the case, The Death of Innocence, that they wrote together in alternate sections, John insists beauty pageants were just \xe2\x80\x9cone of her many hobbies\xe2\x80\x9d. Patsy, however, spends the next seven pages describing her daughter\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cgift\xe2\x80\x9d at \xe2\x80\x9cperforming\xe2\x80\x9d (she also doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mention any of her daughter\xe2\x80\x99s other hobbies). Beauty pageants were unusual in Colorado, she writes, but she had done them herself when she was younger. For one, she bought JonBen\xc3\xa9t \xe2\x80\x9ca Ziegfeld Follies costume, reminiscent of the one I had worn in the Miss West Virginia Pageant some 20 years earlier. Like mother, like daughter.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nProtesters unhappy at the lack of a decision in the murder case march outside the justice centre in Boulder, Colorado, in 1999. Photograph: Reuters\n\nSo Patsy, in particular, was shocked by the negative public reaction to the pageant photos after her daughter\xe2\x80\x99s murder. One newscaster said the six-year-old resembled \xe2\x80\x9ca hooker\xe2\x80\x9d. Pretty much only pageant photos of JonBen\xc3\xa9t were used in the media, even though she had only been in nine pageants. There was a definite intimation in the now-hysterical media coverage that to put your child in a beauty pageant was weird, unnatural and sexually suspect. JonBen\xc3\xa9t was simultaneously deified as a photogenic angel and vilified as a child temptress, and her parents were criticised for fetishising her looks, while the public and media did exactly the same thing themselves. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat I saw on the pageant video \xe2\x80\xa6 you don\xe2\x80\x99t do that to a six-year-old,\xe2\x80\x9d JonBen\xc3\xa9t\xe2\x80\x99s former dance teacher, Kit Andrew, says in Perfect Murder, Perfect Town.\n\nBut there is an alternative way of looking at the pageants. Child beauty contestants, while unusual in Colorado, are hardly unknown in the US. Thousands of pageants still take place every year, and no one is saying every parent involved is a potential killer. In fact, far from incriminating the Ramseys, the pageant photos could be seen as almost exonerating them: it could very easily be argued that the pageants brought JonBen\xc3\xa9t to the attention of a local paedophile, and several have since been suspected, but never charged.\n\nJohn and Patsy\xe2\x80\x99s general demeanour was also deemed suspicious by the police, the media and the public. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Ramseys didn\xe2\x80\x99t appear to behave the way parents in this situation are \xe2\x80\x98supposed\xe2\x80\x99 to behave. They didn\xe2\x80\x99t cling together and constantly comfort and reassure each other,\xe2\x80\x9d John Douglas writes in The Cases That Haunt Us.\n\nBut John and Patsy were, they write themselves, \xe2\x80\x9cin shock and medicated so we could function\xe2\x80\x9d for weeks after the murder. So to judge how they spoke, looked and interacted as being indicative of something was not really fair. But this is what happens to every parent who loses a child in a high-profile case: their behaviour is scrutinised for clues.\n\nWhen a parent loses a child, the most natural human response is sympathy. But that is not what many feel for parents in high-profile cases. When Madeleine McCann went missing in 2007, her father, Gerry, and in particular her mother, Kate, were widely criticised: Gerry, some sniped, was too articulate and Kate looked too pretty. What kind of mother puts on eye shadow when her daughter is missing? Kerry Needham was dismissed as a feckless teenage mother when her baby son, Ben, went missing on Kos in 1991. When two-year-old Lane Graves was killed by an alligator at Disney World in a freak accident earlier this year, parenting chat sites were swamped with people criticising the parents for letting a little boy play near the water in the evening, as though that were unusual on a Florida holiday.\n\nParent-blaming is all-too-common these days, and usually the point is to make other parents feel better about their own parenting skills. But in cases such as that of JonBen\xc3\xa9t, something else is going on. By demonising parents who have suffered a terrible trauma, the rest of us can reassure ourselves that they are different from us: those parents are flawed, even evil, and we are good and therefore our child will never go missing \xe2\x80\x93 in Kos, in Praia de Luz, from our house in the middle of the night \xe2\x80\x93 like theirs did. The rush to blame JonBen\xc3\xa9t\xe2\x80\x99s parents can also be partly put down to the public needing to reassure themselves that, contrary to what the Ramseys said, killers don\xe2\x80\x99t break into houses and murder children where they should be most safe. That only happens when the parents themselves are killers. And yet.\n\nBrennan says: \xe2\x80\x9cIn 2000, I wrote a piece that ran in the Dallas Morning News pointing out that, nine months after this crime, someone broke into a house near the Ramsey house and was in the process of assaulting a nine-year-old girl in the middle of the night and was chased out by her mother. The girl went to the same dance studio as JonBen\xc3\xa9t. The police said they believed it had no connection to the Ramsey case.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAfter writing about the case for 20 years, Brennan says he has come to believe the family weren\xe2\x80\x99t involved: \xe2\x80\x9cIf you look at the autopsy photos and you see the deep furrow in her neck created by that ligature, you see a tremendous amount of force was used. That does not suggest staging to me \xe2\x80\x93 the person who did it, meant it. But the Ramseys have nothing in their background to suggest that this level of evil dwelled in their hearts,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. But this theory, like the ones about whether the Ramseys behaved how they were \xe2\x80\x9csupposed\xe2\x80\x9d to, relies on imagining how we would behave if our child had been killed, or if we had killed them accidentally. But no one can do that accurately. And anyway, it\xe2\x80\x99s irrelevant, since the case is about the Ramseys, not anyone else.\n\nIt is entirely possible JonBen\xc3\xa9t was killed by a member of her family. It is also very likely the case will never be solved: Patsy has since died and the case gets colder every year. The ghoulish hysteria around her murder has lasted more than three times longer than JonBen\xc3\xa9t\xe2\x80\x99s life did. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve covered lots of big stories: the Challenger, presidential elections. But this \xe2\x80\x93 it is something that I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking about all the time,\xe2\x80\x9d says Brennan. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is an impossibly complex, seemingly unsolvable riddle.\xe2\x80\x9d It is also the death of a child, killed with shocking brutality. But it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to see the truth beneath the schlock.\n\nThe Killing of JonBen\xc3\xa9t: Her Father Speaks, 9pm, 11 December, Crime and Investigation; Who Killed JonBen\xc3\xa9t?, 10pm, 18 December, Lifetime; The Case of JonBen\xc3\xa9t Ramsey, 22 December, More4'"
"b""This is a list of famous serial killers who are still alive. When serial killers are caught, after a long period of horrific, evil crimes, it\xe2\x80\x99s almost expected that their lives will be coming to an end. So it\xe2\x80\x99s remarkable to hear about serial killers that are still alive, most of whom are serving life sentences in prison.\n\nSome serial killers who could've been on death row took plea deals, so now they will be serving life in prison. Dennis Rader, also known as BTK, was caught in 2005, and still remains in prison. Very few serial killers who have been caught have been released from prison, but there are still some odd exceptions where the law and morality don\xe2\x80\x99t intersect.\n\nAre these some of America's most famous serial killers? There are some famous mass murderers on here, too. How did these serial killers murder their victims? This list answers these questions and more about some of the world\xe2\x80\x99s most notorious living serial killers. For example, Wayne Williams, believed to be responsible for the Atlanta child murders is still in prison, as is David Berkowitz, AKA Son of Sam. If you're curious about famous serial killers still alive, be sure to bookmark this page. It will feature a list of murderers, such as the worst death row inmates.\n\nWhat serial killers are still alive? Well, there are more serial killers alive today than you might expect. Gary Ridgway is one of many serial killers in prison. Rosemary West, one-half of a duo who committed unspeakable crimes, is one of many famous murderers still alive. Paul Bernardo is probably one of the most dangerous serial killers alive. But there are unfortunately plenty of other serial killers currently in prison.\n\nMany famous serial killers were murdered in jail. The male and female serial killers on this list either received life sentences or managed to avoid life in prison. These rare serial killers may have taken the lives of at least three people, some with victim numbers over 50, yet are still alive themselves."""
"b""Most people were first introduced to Shia LaBeouf in 2000 when he starred in the Disney show Even Stevens. As Louis Stevens, the mischievous ne\xe2\x80\x99er do well little brother of a perfectionist older sister, he seemed to fit right in with the glossy kids the channel was prepping for stardom.\n\nBut LaBeouf\xe2\x80\x99s career has taken some interesting twists and turns in the intervening dozen-plus years, as he\xe2\x80\x99s appeared in franchises like Transformers as well as prestigious indies, and then hit some controversial and legal snags and engaged in political protest.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe star is a by-product of the machine age,\xe2\x80\x9d he told ArtNet News in 2016, \xe2\x80\x9ca relic of modernist ideals, it\xe2\x80\x99s outmoded.\xe2\x80\x9d So instead of playing by the script, LaBeouf has continually made choices that are, well, unusual. Think: performance art projects, cryptic interviews and swathes of time spent without bathing.\n\nHere\xe2\x80\x99s a roundup of the actor\xe2\x80\x99s enduring, awesome weirdness\xe2\x80\x94and his evolving public art projects.\n\nJuly 2009: After LaBeouf was charged with a misdemeanor for criminal trespassing following his 21st birthday, he told David Letterman that he\xe2\x80\x99d just been trying to buy some cigarettes at four in the morning. \xe2\x80\x9cI got really wasted in Chicago and ended up celebrating in Walgreens,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. He ended up making multiple late-night Walgreens visits, each of them involving a costume change. Ultimately, the store dropped the charges.\n\nDecember 2013: LaBeouf releases a short film online that viewers discover is a plagiarized enactment of a short story that was actually written by author Daniel Clowes, who is not credited. This incident kicks off LaBeouf\xe2\x80\x99s notable phase of borrowing quotes, lines and works from other people. In a 2016 interview with ArtNet News, he cited this moment as transformational in terms of moving him introducing him to a future in performance art. \xe2\x80\x9cThe idea of the \xe2\x80\x98star\xe2\x80\x99 could become a prime site for the formulation of new stances whose honesty might advance a more satisfying kind of affect,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. He apologized via Twitter to Clowes\xe2\x80\x94but the tweets were all unattributed quotes themselves, too.\n\nFebruary 2014: LaBeouf wears a paper bag on his head as he walks the red carpet at the Cannes Film Festival for the premiere of his movie Nymphomaniac. The bag reads \xe2\x80\x9cI am not famous anymore\xe2\x80\x9d in large letters across his face.\n\nFebruary 2014: During a press conference to promote Nymphomaniac at the Berlin Film Festival, he delivers a cryptic line: \xe2\x80\x9cWhen the seagulls follow the trawler, it is because they think sardines will be thrown into the sea.\xe2\x80\x9d Then he stormed out. Journalists noted that the line is actually from a Manchester United football player named Eric Cantona, who reportedly said these same words before walking out of a news conference in 1995 after being convicted for assault.\n\nFebruary 2014: LaBeouf launches the #IAMSORRY project, in which he appears alone with that same paper bag over his head in a room in a Los Angeles art space. Visitors are allowed, one by one, to visit him and use a variety of props in their interactions, including a bottle of Jack Daniels. Afterward, LaBeouf said in an interview with Dazed that he had been raped by one of the visitors during the 5-day experiment. Afterward, his collaborators Turner and R\xc3\xb6nkk\xc3\xb6 publicly noted that they \xe2\x80\x9cput a stop\xe2\x80\x9d to the incident when they became aware of it. No charges were pressed against the alleged perpetrator.\n\nJune 2014: During a Broadway performance of Cabaret, LaBeouf is escorted from the audience after allegedly engaging in disruptive behavior. (Witnesses say he went up on stage and grabbed at actor Alan Cumming.) He subsequently spends the night in jail, and eventually pled guilty to disorderly conduct.\n\nJune 2014: LaBeouf reportedly heads straight to an audition after spending his night in jail. The movie is War Dogs, directed by Jake Phillips\xe2\x80\x94and the actor he\xe2\x80\x99s auditioning with is current late-night host James Corden. (Ultimately, War Dogs would be made starring Jonah Hill and Miles Teller and released in 2016.) In the audition, LaBeouf reads his line while wearing his shoelaces dangling over his face. As Phillips later explained, the actor\xe2\x80\x99s shoelaces had been removed during his jail stint. \xe2\x80\x9cSo he was carrying his shoelaces, and he put them on his face because he was being weird and wanted to throw you off a little bit,\xe2\x80\x9d he told Corden in a later interview.\n\nJanuary 2015: In Sia\xe2\x80\x99s music video for \xe2\x80\x9cElastic Heart,\xe2\x80\x9d LaBeouf and dancer Maddie Ziegler don nude leotards and circle each other warily in a large metal bird cage. The pop singer later apologizes after some find the interaction between LeBeouf and Zieger potentially sexually suggestive, stating that the pair were the only two actors she felt could play \xe2\x80\x9ctwo warring \xe2\x80\x98Sia\xe2\x80\x99 self states.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMarch 2015: LaBeouf sets up a livestream of his heartbeat.\n\nMay 2015: Along with art students at Central St. Martins, LaBeouf films 30 minutes of seemingly improvisational acting in front of a green screen. The soundbites from the footage would become prime meme material. \xe2\x80\x9cSeen from a distance, almost everything looks beautiful,\xe2\x80\x9d he muses poetically. At one point, he yells: \xe2\x80\x9cDo it! Just do it! Don\xe2\x80\x99t let your dreams be dreams!\xe2\x80\x9d This particular segment spawned a series of its own memes, his tough-love acting taking the Internet by storm.\n\nOctober 2015: LaBeouf was arrested for public intoxication while crossing the street in Austin, Texas, booked into the local jail for the night, and later released on his own recognizance.\n\nNovember 2015: He and a writer for Dazed magazine both don GoPro video cameras on their heads and sit filming each other, in silence, for an hour. There are moments of levity throughout as the two can\xe2\x80\x99t help but laugh.\n\nNovember 2015: It\xe2\x80\x99s a busy month of self-reflection for LaBeouf, who invites fans to join him as he watches all of his movies\xe2\x80\x94in order\xe2\x80\x94at Manhattan\xe2\x80\x99s Angelika Film Center. He also livestreams his own face during the experience, sharing the varied emotions of his reactions with the world at large. They\xe2\x80\x99re pretty good.\n\nFebruary 2016: He spends 24 hours in an elevator as performance art, again with frequent collaborators R\xc3\xb6nkk\xc3\xb6 and Turner. They livestream the whole thing, naturally.\n\nApril 2016: A man in New York City was punched out by a stranger who said he \xe2\x80\x9clooked like Shia LaBeouf.\xe2\x80\x9d The actor called and left a message to apologize to his victimized doppelg\xc3\xa4nger even though he had nothing to do with the actual incident\xe2\x80\x94and offer him some soup as a condolence. \xe2\x80\x9cHe was like, \xe2\x80\x98Hey, this is Shia LaBeouf\xe2\x80\xa6 I just read an article that you were punched in the face because you look like me?\xe2\x80\x99 And he was like, \xe2\x80\x98Aw, man. That sucks. I\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry. But I get it. It\xe2\x80\x99s happened to me before.\xe2\x80\x99 And then he was like, \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I wish I was in New York. I\xe2\x80\x99d come bring you soup,'\xe2\x80\x9d the lookalike told the New York Post.\n\nMay 2016: Shia launches an open-sourced, monthlong cross-country journey. Called \xe2\x80\x9c#TakeMeAnywhere,\xe2\x80\x9d he tweets out his geographic coordinates daily, allowing fans to find him, pick him up, and take him\xe2\x80\xa6 anywhere. (And do pretty much anything with him in the process. He\xe2\x80\x99s shared some pretty weird revelations with some of his fans in the process, but others came away impressed. \xe2\x80\x9cSometimes when you meet your heroes, you\xe2\x80\x99re disappointed when you meet them, but not Shia,\xe2\x80\x9d one fan who met up with him said afterward. \xe2\x80\x9cHe was just an amazing guy. He was so receptive and conversational. I think he\xe2\x80\x99s a true artist.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nDecember 2016: The trio of LaBeouf, R\xc3\xb6nkk\xc3\xb6, and Turner camp out at the Sydney Opera House during a culture festival for two nights as, one by one, visitors delivered a message to them starting with the cryptic phrase \xe2\x80\x9cAnd in the end\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cAs 2016 draws to a close, we are all too aware of the pervasive sense of foreboding that has come to define the year,\xe2\x80\x9d LaBeouf and his collaborators expressed in a statement about the project, called #ANDINTHEEND. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet, we still yearn for some greater truth, for the utopias of our distant horizons, expressed through art.\xe2\x80\x9d The messages from the visitors were streamed online and on a giant digital screen outside the Opera House, while the three onstage intermittently read out some of the striking statements.\n\nJanuary 2017: In his most overtly political work yet, LaBeouf and company set up a camera connected to a continuous livestream outside of New York\xe2\x80\x99s Museum of the Moving Image. The message, this time, was \xe2\x80\x9cHe Will Not Divide Us\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94that \xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x9d referring to new President Donald Trump. To launch the protest project, LaBeouf recruited Jaden Smith to recite the phrase like a mantra for over four hours during Inauguration Day. The livestream was ostensibly set to continue throughout Trump\xe2\x80\x99s tenure, and drew crowds\xe2\x80\x94and controversy. LaBeouf was allegedly arrested during an on-camera tussle with a detractor.\n\nFebruary 2017: The Museum of the Moving Image shut down the He Will Not Divide Us project on Feb. 10 in a move that LaBeouf and his collaborators considered \xe2\x80\x9cabandonment.\xe2\x80\x9d They then relocated the installation to the El Rey Theater in Albuquerque, New Mexico on Feb. 18 to keep the momentum going. But that was not to last long. According to Deadline, the camera was vandalized with spray paint after just two days at its new home, and on Feb. 23, LaBeouf shared an update that the stream had been taken down after reports of gunshots.\n\nMarch 2017: He Will Not Divide Us reopens on March 22\xe2\x80\x94with some adjustments\xe2\x80\x94in the U.K., taking the form of a waving flag printed with the statement and hoisted above the Foundation for Art and Creative Technology in Liverpool. \xe2\x80\x9cEvents have shown that America is simply not safe enough for this artwork to exist,\xe2\x80\x9d LaBeouf, R\xc3\xb6nkk\xc3\xb6, and Turner said in a statement about the work\xe2\x80\x99s latest iteration.\n\nTurns out, the U.K. wasn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x9csafe enough\xe2\x80\x9d either: after just a single day, police were called to the scene when trespassers attempted to climb the flagpole, according to a Merseyside Police statement. The flag was subsequently removed on police advice, the BBC reports.\n\nApril 2017: LaBeouf performs a 2017 version of the Walden Pond experiment, spending a month alone in a cabin in Finland starting April 12. (Ronkko and Turner are also alone, at different cabins.) The new project is called #ALONETOGETHER. Visitors to a Finnish museum can send messages to the artists, which they\xe2\x80\x99ll respond to by text. As usual, it\xe2\x80\x99s livestreamed; so far, they\xe2\x80\x99ve been complaining of the cold at their mysterious, remote locales in Lapland. Shia\xe2\x80\x99s also shared tidbits about his \xe2\x80\x9cbadass\xe2\x80\x9d grandmother, the funky spelling of his last name, and his teetotaling approach to the experiment.\n\nJuly 2017: LaBeouf is arrested in Savannah, GA for \xe2\x80\x9cdisorderly conduct, obstruction and public drunkenness\xe2\x80\x9d while trying to bum a cigarette, and released soon after on bail. However, video of an expletive-riddled, racist rant leveled at the police officers took on a life of its own, prompting LaBeouf to share a formal apology via Twitter. He called the incident a \xe2\x80\x9cnew low\xe2\x80\x9d and expressed a new commitment towards attaining sobriety.\n\nMarch 2018: LaBeouf is the cover star of Esquire Magazine, in which he opens up about his struggles with addiction, his fraught relationship with his father and the screenplay he penned, working title Honey Boy, based on his life as a child star living with his dad. (Soon after, news came out that the movie would go forward with LaBeouf playing his own father, and actor Lucas Hedges playing LaBeouf as a kid.) LaBeouf also noted, as an aside, that Kanye West once took a bunch of his clothes out of his closet at his own offering.\n\nApril 2018: In an appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live! LaBeouf is his usual candid self \xe2\x80\x94 maybe a little too candid. While discussing his experiences in Finland and the acceptance of nudity he encountered there, he got reflective with a NSFW memory.\n\nGet The Brief.

"b'American singer-songwriter\n\nTaylor Alison Swift (born December 13, 1989) is an American singer-songwriter. Her narrative songwriting, which often centers around her personal life, has received widespread critical plaudits and media coverage.\n\nBorn in West Reading, Pennsylvania, Swift relocated to Nashville, Tennessee in 2004 to pursue a career in country music. Her 2006 eponymous debut studio album was the longest-charting album of the 2000s on the Billboard 200. Its third single, ""Our Song"", made her the youngest person to single-handedly write and perform a number-one song on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart. Swift\'s second studio album, Fearless (2008), expands on country pop styles and won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year. Buoyed by the success of crossover singles ""Love Story"" and ""You Belong with Me"", Fearless was certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Speak Now (2010), her third studio album, blends country pop with rock sensibility and spawned the top-10 singles ""Mine"" and ""Back to December"".\n\nSwift\'s fourth studio album, Red (2012), experiments with various pop, rock, and electronic genres. It included the top-five singles ""We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together"", her first Billboard Hot 100 number-one hit, and ""I Knew You Were Trouble"". With her fifth studio album, 1989 (2014), she announced her full transition to pop. The synth-pop record made Swift the first female solo artist to win the Grammy Award for Album of the Year twice and amassed three Billboard Hot 100 number-one hits\xe2\x80\x94""Shake It Off"", ""Blank Space"", and ""Bad Blood"". She extended the electronic-pop sound on her next two studio albums: Reputation (2017), which incorporates elements of hip hop and featured the Billboard Hot 100 number-one single ""Look What You Made Me Do"", and Lover (2019), which was the world\'s best-selling studio album of 2019. Swift\'s indie folk and alternative rock eighth studio album, Folklore (2020), and its lead single, ""Cardigan"", made her the first act to debut atop both the Billboard 200 and Hot 100 simultaneously.\n\nWith sales of over 200 million records worldwide, Swift is one of the best-selling music artists of all time. Her accolades include 10 Grammy Awards, an Emmy Award, seven Guinness World Records, 32 American Music Awards (the most wins by an artist), and 23 Billboard Music Awards (the most wins by a woman). She ranked eighth on Billboard\'s Greatest of All Time Artists Chart and, as a songwriter, was recognized in Rolling Stone\'s 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time (2015). Swift has been included in various power rankings, such as Time\'s annual list of the 100 most influential people in the world (2010, 2015 and 2019) and the Forbes Celebrity 100 (placing first in 2016 and 2019). She was named Woman of the Decade (2010s) by Billboard and Artist of the Decade (2010s) by the American Music Awards, and two of her albums featured in Rolling Stone\'s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time (2020).\n\nLife and career\n\n1989\xe2\x80\x932003: Early life\n\nTaylor Alison Swift was born on December 13, 1989,[4] in West Reading, Pennsylvania.[5] Her father, Scott Kingsley Swift, is a former stockbroker for Merrill Lynch; her mother, Andrea Gardner Swift (n\xc3\xa9e Finlay), is a former homemaker who previously worked as a mutual fund marketing executive.[6] Swift, who said she has Scottish heritage,[7] was named after the singer-songwriter James Taylor.[8] Her younger brother, Austin Kingsley Swift, is an actor.[9] Swift spent her early years on a Christmas tree farm that her father purchased from one of his clients.[10][11] Swift identifies as Christian.[12] She attended preschool and kindergarten at the Alvernia Montessori School, run by the Bernadine Franciscan sisters,[13] before transferring to The Wyndcroft School.[14] The family moved to a rented house in the suburban town of Wyomissing, Pennsylvania,[15] where she attended Wyomissing Area Junior/Senior High School.[16]\n\nAt age nine, Swift became interested in musical theater and performed in four Berks Youth Theatre Academy productions.[17] She also traveled regularly to New York City for vocal and acting lessons.[18] Swift later shifted her focus toward country music, inspired by Shania Twain\'s songs, which made her ""want to just run around the block four times and daydream about everything.""[19] She spent weekends performing at local festivals and events.[20][21] After watching a documentary about Faith Hill, Swift felt sure she needed to move to Nashville, Tennessee, to pursue a career in music.[22] She traveled with her mother at age eleven to visit Nashville record labels and submitted demo tapes of Dolly Parton and The Chicks karaoke covers.[23] She was rejected, however, because ""everyone in that town wanted to do what I wanted to do. So, I kept thinking to myself, I need to figure out a way to be different.""[24]\n\nWhen Swift was around 12 years old, computer repairman and local musician Ronnie Cremer taught her to play guitar. He helped with her first efforts as a songwriter, leading her to write ""Lucky You"".[25] In 2003, Swift and her parents started working with New York-based talent manager Dan Dymtrow. With his help, Swift modeled for Abercrombie & Fitch as part of their ""Rising Stars"" campaign, had an original song included on a Maybelline compilation CD, and attended meetings with major record labels.[26] After performing original songs at an RCA Records showcase, Swift was given an artist development deal and began making frequent trips to Nashville with her mother.[27][28]\n\nTo help Swift break into country music, her father transferred to Merrill Lynch\'s Nashville office when she was 14 years old, and the family relocated to a lakefront house in Hendersonville, Tennessee.[10][29] Swift attended Hendersonville High School[30] but transferred to the Aaron Academy after two years, which could better accommodate her touring schedule through homeschooling; she graduated a year early.[31]\n\n2004\xe2\x80\x932008: Career beginnings and Taylor Swift\n\nIn Nashville, Swift worked with experienced Music Row songwriters such as Troy Verges, Brett Beavers, Brett James, Mac McAnally, and the Warren Brothers,[32][33] and formed a lasting working relationship with Liz Rose.[34] They began meeting for two-hour writing sessions every Tuesday afternoon after school.[35] Rose thought the sessions were ""some of the easiest I\'ve ever done. Basically, I was just her editor. She\'d write about what happened in school that day. She had such a clear vision of what she was trying to say. And she\'d come in with the most incredible hooks."" Swift became the youngest artist signed by the Sony/ATV Tree publishing house[36] but left the Sony-owned RCA Records at the age of 14.[21] She later said: ""I genuinely felt that I was running out of time. I wanted to capture these years of my life on an album while they still represented what I was going through.""[37]\n\nAt an industry showcase at Nashville\'s Bluebird Cafe in 2005, Swift caught the attention of Scott Borchetta, a DreamWorks Records executive who was preparing to form an independent record label, Big Machine Records. She had first met Borchetta in 2004.[38] Swift became one of Big Machine\'s first signings, and her father purchased a three-percent stake in the company for an estimated $120,000.[39][40] She began working on her eponymous debut album shortly after. Swift persuaded Big Machine to hire her demo producer Nathan Chapman, with whom she felt she had the right ""chemistry"".[21] She wrote three of the album\'s songs alone, and co-wrote the remaining eight with Rose, Robert Ellis Orrall, Brian Maher, and Angelo Petraglia.[41] Taylor Swift was released on October 24, 2006.[42] Jon Caramanica of The New York Times described it as ""a small masterpiece of pop-minded country, both wide-eyed and cynical, held together by Ms. Swift\'s firm, pleading voice.""[43] Taylor Swift peaked at number five on the Billboard 200 albums chart in the United States, spending 157 weeks there\xe2\x80\x94the longest stay on the chart by any release in the U.S. that decade.[44] As of August 2016, the album had sold over 7.75 million copies worldwide.[45]\n\nBig Machine Records was still in its infancy during the June 2006 release of the lead single, ""Tim McGraw"". Swift and her mother helped ""stuff the CD singles into envelopes to send to radio.""[46] She spent much of 2006 promoting Taylor Swift with a radio tour, television appearances, and opening for Rascal Flatts on select dates during their 2006 tour[47][48] after they fired their previous opening act, Eric Church, for playing longer than his allotted time. Church jokingly told Swift she should give him her first gold record as thanks for getting fired. She sent him her first gold record with a note that said, ""Thanks for playing too long and too loud on the Flatts tour. I sincerely appreciate it. Taylor.""[49]\n\nBorchetta said that although record industry peers initially disapproved of his signing a 16-year-old singer-songwriter, Swift tapped into a previously unknown market\xe2\x80\x94teenage girls who listen to country music.[10] Following ""Tim McGraw"", four more singles were released throughout 2007 and 2008: ""Teardrops on My Guitar"", ""Our Song"", ""Picture to Burn"" and ""Should\'ve Said No"". All appeared on Billboard\'s Hot Country Songs chart in the United States, with ""Our Song"", and ""Should\'ve Said No"" reaching number one. With ""Our Song"", Swift became the youngest person to single-handedly write and perform a number-one song on the chart.[50] ""Teardrops on My Guitar"" reached number thirteen on the Billboard Hot 100 songs chart in the United States.[51] Swift also released the holiday album Sounds of the Season: The Taylor Swift Holiday Collection in October 2007 and the EP Beautiful Eyes in July 2008.[52][53] She promoted her debut album extensively as the opening act for other artists on their tours.[54]\n\nSwift won accolades for Taylor Swift. She was one of the recipients of the Nashville Songwriters Association\'s Songwriter/Artist of the Year in 2007, becoming the youngest person to be honored with the title.[55] She also won the Country Music Association\'s Horizon Award for Best New Artist,[56] the Academy of Country Music Awards\' Top New Female Vocalist,[57] and the American Music Awards\' Favorite Country Female Artist honor.[58] She was also nominated for Best New Artist at the 50th Annual Grammy Awards.[59] She opened for the Rascal Flatts on their 2008 summer and fall tour.[60] In July of that year, Swift began a romance with singer Joe Jonas that ended three months later.[61][62]\n\n2008\xe2\x80\x932010: Fearless and acting\n\nSwift\'s second studio album, Fearless, was released on November 11, 2008.[42] The lead single, ""Love Story"", was released in September 2008. It peaked at number four on the Billboard Hot 100[63] and number one in Australia.[64] Four more singles were released throughout 2008 and 2009: ""White Horse"", ""You Belong with Me"", ""Fifteen"" and ""Fearless"". ""You Belong with Me"" was the album\'s highest-charting single on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number two.[65] The album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and was the top-selling album of 2009 in the United States.[66] Swift\'s first concert tour, the Fearless Tour, promoted the album[67] and grossed over $63 million.[68] Journey to Fearless, a three-part documentary miniseries, was aired on television and later released on DVD and Blu-ray.[69] Swift also performed as a supporting act for Keith Urban\'s Escape Together World Tour.[70]\n\nIn 2009, the music video for ""You Belong with Me"" was named Best Female Video at the MTV Video Music Awards.[73] Her acceptance speech was interrupted by rapper Kanye West,[74] an incident that became the subject of controversy, widespread media attention, and many Internet memes.[75] James Montgomery of MTV argued the incident and subsequent media attention turned Swift into ""a bona-fide mainstream celebrity"".[76] That year she won five American Music Awards, including Artist of the Year and Favorite Country Album.[77] Billboard named her 2009\'s Artist of the Year.[78] The album ranked number 99 on NPR\'s 2017 list of the 150 Greatest Albums Made By Women.[79]\n\nAt the 52nd Annual Grammy Awards, Fearless was named Album of the Year and Best Country Album, and ""White Horse"" was named Best Country Song and Best Female Country Vocal Performance. Swift was the youngest artist to win Album of the Year.[a] During the ceremony, Swift sang ""You Belong with Me"" and ""Rhiannon"" with Stevie Nicks, a performance that received negative reviews and caused media backlash.[76][82] Jon Caramanica of The New York Times found it ""refreshing to see someone so gifted make the occasional flub"" and described Swift as ""the most important new pop star of the past few years"".[83] Swift became the youngest artist to be named Entertainer of the Year by the Country Music Association (CMA).[84] Fearless also won the CMA Album of the Year Award.[85]\n\nSwift contributed backing vocals to John Mayer\'s ""Half of My Heart"", a single from his fourth album, Battle Studies (2009).[86] She co-wrote and recorded ""Best Days of Your Life"" with Kellie Pickler,[87] and co-wrote two songs for the Hannah Montana: The Movie soundtrack\xe2\x80\x94""You\'ll Always Find Your Way Back Home"" and ""Crazier"".[72] Swift also provided vocals for Boys Like Girls\' ""Two Is Better Than One"".[88] She contributed two songs to the Valentine\'s Day soundtrack, including the country-pop song ""Today Was a Fairytale"", which became her first number one on the Canadian Hot 100 chart and her second number-two peaking song in the U.S.[89][90] While filming her cinematic debut Valentine\'s Day in October 2009, Swift began a romantic relationship with co-star Taylor Lautner; they broke up later that year.[91][92] The romantic comedy, released in 2010, saw her play the ditzy girlfriend of a high school jock, a role which the Los Angeles Times felt showed Swift had ""serious comedic potential"".[93] On the other hand, in a scathing review, a critic for Variety deemed her ""entirely undirected"", arguing ""she needs to find a skilled director to tamp her down and channel her obviously abundant energy"".[94]\n\nSwift made her TV acting debut in a 2009 episode of CBS\'s CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, playing a rebellious teenager. The New York Times noted the character allowed Swift to be ""a little bit naughty, and credibly so"".[95] Later that year, Swift both hosted and performed as the musical guest on an episode of Saturday Night Live and was the first host to write their own opening monologue.[96][97] Entertainment Weekly described her as ""this season\'s best Saturday Night Live host so far"", noting she ""was always up for the challenge, seemed to be having fun, and helped the rest of the cast nail the punchlines"".[98]\n\n2010\xe2\x80\x932014: Speak Now and Red\n\nIn August 2010, Swift released ""Mine"", the lead single from her third studio album, Speak Now. It entered the U.S. charts at number three, making Swift the second female artist in the history of the Hot 100 (after Mariah Carey) to debut multiple tracks in the top five in one year; the other was ""Today Was a Fairytale"" at number two.[99] Swift wrote the album alone and co-produced every track.[100] Speak Now, released on October 25, 2010,[42] debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and was the 16th album in chart history to achieve opening week sales of one million copies.[101] It became the fastest-selling digital album by a female artist, with 278,000 downloads in a week, earning Swift an entry in the 2010 Guinness World Records.[102] Three of the album\'s singles, ""Mine"", ""Back to December"", and ""Mean"", peaked in the top ten in Canada,[90] while in the U.S., the earlier two along with the title track peaked in the top 10 of the Hot 100 chart. Later in 2010, she briefly dated actor Jake Gyllenhaal.[103]\n\n""Mean"" won Best Country Song and Best Country Solo Performance at the 54th Annual Grammy Awards.[104] Swift performed it during the ceremony. Claire Suddath of Time felt she ""delivered her comeback on-key and with a vengeance"";[105] Jayme Deerwester of USA Today wrote that the criticism in 2010 seemed to have ""made her a better songwriter and live performer"".[106] Swift won other awards for Speak Now, including Songwriter/Artist of the Year by the Nashville Songwriters Association (2010 and 2011),[107][108] Woman of the Year by Billboard (2011),[109] and Entertainer of the Year by the Academy of Country Music (2011 and 2012)[110] and the Country Music Association in 2011.[111] At the American Music Awards of 2011, Swift won Artist of the Year and Favorite Country Album.[112] Rolling Stone placed Speak Now at number 45 in its 2012 list of the ""50 Best Female Albums of All Time"", writing: ""She might get played on the country station, but she\'s one of the few genuine rock stars we\'ve got these days, with a flawless ear for what makes a song click.""[113]\n\nThe Speak Now World Tour ran from February 2011 to March 2012 and grossed over $123 million.[114] In November 2011, Swift released her first live album, Speak Now World Tour: Live.[115] The following month, she contributed two original songs to The Hunger Games soundtrack album: ""Safe & Sound"", co-written and recorded with the Civil Wars and T-Bone Burnett, and ""Eyes Open"". ""Safe & Sound"" won the Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media and was also nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song.[116][117] Swift contributed vocals to rapper B.o.B\'s ""Both of Us"", released in May 2012.[118] From July to September 2012, Swift dated political heir Conor Kennedy.[119] In August, Swift released ""We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together"", the lead single from her fourth studio album, Red. It became her first number one in the U.S. and New Zealand[120][121] and reached the top slot on iTunes\' digital song sales chart 50 minutes after its release, earning the Fastest Selling Single in Digital History Guinness World Record.[122] Swift released the album\'s second single, ""Begin Again"", in October. It reached number seven on the Billboard Hot 100.[123] Other singles released from the album include ""I Knew You Were Trouble"", ""22"", ""Everything Has Changed"", ""The Last Time"", and ""Red"". ""I Knew You Were Trouble"" peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100.[123]\n\nRed was released on October 22, 2012,[42] incorporating new genres for Swift, such as heartland rock, dubstep and dance-pop. The album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 1.21 million copies. This marked the highest opening sales in a decade in the United States, and made Swift the first female to have two million-selling album openings, a record recognized by the Guinness World Records.[124][125] The Red Tour ran from March 2013 to June 2014 and grossed over $150 million; it broke the ticket sales record in China with all 18,000 tickets sold in 60 seconds.[126][127] Red earned several accolades, including four nominations at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards.[128] Its single ""I Knew You Were Trouble"" won Best Female Video at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards.[129] Swift was named Best Female Country Artist at the 2012 American Music Awards and Artist of the Year at the 2013 ceremony.[130][131] She received the Nashville Songwriters Association\'s Songwriter/Artist Award for the fifth and sixth consecutive years in 2012 and 2013.[132] Swift was also honored by the Association with a special Pinnacle Award, making her the second recipient of the accolade after Garth Brooks.[133] During this time, she had a short-term relationship with British singer Harry Styles.[134]\n\nIn 2013, Swift co-wrote and co-produced ""Sweeter than Fiction"" with Jack Antonoff for the One Chance film soundtrack and received a Best Original Song nomination at the 71st Golden Globe Awards.[135] She provided guest vocals for Tim McGraw\'s song ""Highway Don\'t Care"", featuring guitar work by Keith Urban.[136] Swift performed ""As Tears Go By"" with the Rolling Stones in Chicago, Illinois as part of the band\'s 50 & Counting tour;[137] after the performance, she stated that the band was a major influence on her career outlook.[138] She also joined Florida Georgia Line on stage during their set at the 2013 Country Radio Seminar to sing ""Cruise"".[139] Swift voiced Audrey, a tree lover, in the animated film The Lorax (2012),[140] made a cameo in the sitcom New Girl (2013),[141] and had a supporting role in the film adaptation of The Giver (2014).[142]\n\n2014\xe2\x80\x932017: 1989\n\nIn March 2014, Swift relocated to New York City.[143] Around this time, she was working on her fifth studio album, 1989, with co-writers Antonoff, Max Martin, Shellback, Imogen Heap, Ryan Tedder, and Ali Payami.[144] She promoted the album through various campaigns, including inviting fans to secret album-listening sessions.[145] Credited as her ""first documented, official pop album"", it marked a departure from her country albums.[146] The album was released on October 27, 2014.[42]\n\n1989 sold 1.28 million copies in the U.S. during the first week of release and debuted atop the Billboard 200. This made Swift the first act to have three albums sell more than one million copies in their opening week, for which she earned a Guinness World Record.[147][148] As of June 2017, 1989 had sold over 10 million copies worldwide.[149] The album was supported by three U.S. number-one singles\xe2\x80\x94""Shake It Off"", ""Blank Space"", and ""Bad Blood"" featuring rapper Kendrick Lamar, two U.S. top-10 entries\xe2\x80\x94""Style"" and ""Wildest Dreams"", and two U.S. top-50 entries\xe2\x80\x94""Out of the Woods"" and ""New Romantics"".[150] ""Shake It Off"", ""Blank Space"", and ""Bad Blood"" also topped the charts in Australia and Canada.[64][90] The video for ""Bad Blood"" won Video of the Year and Best Collaboration at the 2015 MTV Video Music Awards.[151] The 1989 World Tour ran from May to December 2015 and was the highest-grossing tour of the year with $250 million in total revenue.[152]\n\nPrior to 1989\'s release, Swift stressed the importance of albums to artists and fans.[153] In November 2014, she removed her entire catalog from Spotify, arguing that the streaming company\'s ad-supported, free service undermined the premium service, which provides higher royalties for songwriters.[154] In a June 2015 open letter, Swift criticized Apple Music for not offering royalties to artists during the streaming service\'s free three-month trial period and stated that she would pull 1989 from the catalog.[155] The following day, Apple announced that it would pay artists during the free trial period,[156] and Swift agreed to stream 1989 on the streaming service.[157] Swift\'s intellectual property rights management and holding company, TAS Rights Management, filed for 73 trademarks related to Swift and the 1989 era memes.[158] She re-added her entire catalog plus 1989 to Spotify, Amazon Music and Google Play and other digital streaming platforms in June 2017.[159]\n\nSwift was named Billboard\'s Woman of the Year in 2014, becoming the first artist to win the award twice.[160] At the 2014 American Music Awards, Swift received the inaugural Dick Clark Award for Excellence.[161] In 2015, Swift won the Brit Award for International Female Solo Artist.[162] Swift was one of eight artists to receive a 50th Anniversary Milestone Award at the 2015 Academy of Country Music Awards.[163] At the 58th Grammy Awards in 2016, 1989 won three awards\xe2\x80\x94Album of the Year, Best Pop Vocal Album, and Best Music Video for ""Bad Blood"". Swift was the first woman and fifth act overall to win Album of the Year twice as a lead artist.[164] She dated Scottish DJ and record producer Calvin Harris from March 2015 to June 2016.[165][166] Prior to their breakup, Swift and Harris co-wrote the song ""This Is What You Came For"", which featured vocals from Barbadian singer Rihanna; Swift was initially credited under the pseudonym Nils Sj\xc3\xb6berg.[167][168] She subsequently dated English actor Tom Hiddleston for a few months,[169] and began dating English actor Joe Alwyn from September 2016.[170] Swift wrote the song ""Better Man"" for Little Big Town\'s seventh album, The Breaker, which was released in November.[171] The song earned Swift an award for Song of the Year at the 51st CMA Awards.[172] Swift and English singer Zayn Malik released a single together, ""I Don\'t Wanna Live Forever"", for the soundtrack of the film Fifty Shades Darker (2017). The song reached number two in the U.S[173] and won Best Collaboration at the 2017 MTV Video Music Awards.[174]\n\n2017\xe2\x80\x932019: Reputation\n\nIn August 2017, Swift successfully sued David Mueller, a former morning show personality for Denver\'s KYGO-FM. Four years earlier, Swift had informed Mueller\'s bosses that he had sexually assaulted her by groping her at an event. After being fired, Mueller accused Swift of lying and sued her for damages from his loss of employment. Shortly after, Swift counter-sued for sexual assault for a dollar.[175] The jury rejected Mueller\'s claims and ruled in favor of Swift.[176] Swift thereafter cleared her social media accounts[177] and then released ""Look What You Made Me Do"" as the lead single from her sixth album, Reputation.[178] The song topped the charts in Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, the UK, and the U.S.[179][180]\n\nSwift released Reputation in November 2017. The album incorporates a heavier, darker electropop sound, with hip hop and EDM influences, new genres for Swift.[181] It debuted atop the Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 1.21 million copies. With this achievement, Swift became the first act to have four albums sell one million copies within one week in the U.S.[182] The album topped the charts in the UK, Australia, and Canada.[183][184] First-week worldwide sales amounted to two million copies.[185] The album has sold over 4.5 million copies worldwide as of 2018.[186] It spawned six other singles, including the U.S. top-five entry ""...Ready for It?"",[180] and three top-20 singles\xe2\x80\x94""End Game"", featuring Ed Sheeran and rapper Future, ""Gorgeous"", and ""Delicate"".[150] Other singles include ""New Year\'s Day"", which was exclusively released to U.S. country radio,[187] and ""Getaway Car"", which served as the final single in Australia.[188]\n\nIn April 2018, Swift featured on Sugarland\'s ""Babe"" from their album Bigger.[b] In support of Reputation, she embarked on her Reputation Stadium Tour, which ran from May to November 2018.[190] In the U.S., the tour grossed $266.1 million in box office and sold over two million tickets, breaking Swift\'s own record for the highest-grossing U.S. tour by a woman, which was previously held by her 1989 World Tour in 2015 ($181.5 million).[191] It also broke the record for the highest-grossing North American concert tour in history. Worldwide, the tour grossed $345.7 million,[192] making it the second highest-grossing concert tour of the year.[193] At the American Music Awards of 2018, Swift won Tour of the Year, Artist of the Year, Favorite Pop/Rock Female Artist, and Favorite Pop/Rock Album for Reputation. With a total of 23 awards, she became the most awarded female winner in AMA history, a record previously held by Whitney Houston.[194]\n\nReputation was Swift\'s last album under her 12-year contract with Big Machine Records. In November 2018, she signed a new multi-album deal with Big Machine\'s distributor Universal Music Group; in the U.S., her subsequent releases were promoted under the Republic Records imprint. Swift said the contract included a provision for her to maintain ownership of her master recordings. In addition, in the event that Universal sells any part of its stake in Spotify, Spotify agreed to distribute a non-recoupable portion of the proceeds among their artists.[195] In late November, Big Machine Records released a Reputation Stadium Tour playlist for streaming services. The playlist includes every song performed on B-stages during the Reputation Stadium Tour.[196] On December 31, Swift released her Reputation Stadium Tour\'s accompanying concert film on Netflix.[197]\n\n2019\xe2\x80\x93present: Lover and Folklore\n\nSwift released her seventh studio album, Lover, on August 23, 2019.[198] Lover was Swift\'s sixth consecutive album to sell more than 500,000 copies in a single week, making Swift the first female artist to do so.[199] All 18 songs from the album charted on the Billboard Hot 100 the same week, setting a record for the most simultaneous entries by a woman.[200] It was the world\'s best-selling studio album of 2019, selling 3.2 million copies.[201] Three singles preceded the release of Lover: ""Me!"", ""You Need to Calm Down"", and ""Lover"", all of which reached the top 10 on the Billboard Hot 100. ""Me!"" debuted at number 100 and rose to number two a week later, scoring the biggest single-week jump in chart history.[202] The last single, ""The Man"", reached the top 40 on the Billboard Hot 100. At the 2019 MTV Video Music Awards, ""Me!"" won Best Visual Effects, and ""You Need to Calm Down"" won Video of the Year and Video for Good. Swift was the first female and second artist overall to win Video of the Year for a video that they directed.[203] The International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) honored Swift as the global best-selling artist of 2019. This made Swift the first woman to win the honor twice; she had previously won in 2014.[204]\n\nIn June 2019, talent manager Scooter Braun acquired Big Machine Records, Swift\'s former record label, and the masters for her first six studio albums.[205] Swift disdained the transaction, stating she had been trying to buy the masters for years, and described Braun as an ""incessant, manipulative bully"".[205] She claimed that Braun offered her a chance at bidding on her masters on the condition of signing a non-disclosure agreement regarding her public statements on Braun, which she refused.[206] In November, Swift said that Braun and Big Machine founder Scott Borchetta had blocked her from performing her older songs at the 2019 American Music Awards and from using older material for her Netflix documentary Miss Americana.[207] After a series of disputes, Big Machine issued a statement saying it had ""agreed to grant all licenses of their artists\' performances to stream post show and for re-broadcast on mutually approved platforms"" for the American Music Awards, though it did not mention Swift by name.[208] In April 2020, Big Machine released Live from Clear Channel Stripped 2008, a live album of Swift\'s performances at a 2008 radio show, which Swift did not authorize.[209] In October 2020, Braun sold Swift\'s masters, videos and artworks, to Shamrock Holdings for $300 million.[210] Swift began re-recording her back catalog in November 2020,[211] and declined an offer by Shamrock to become an equity partner, on the grounds that Braun would continue to profit from her work.[212]\n\nAt the 2019 American Music Awards, Swift won six awards, including Artist of the Year and Artist of the Decade.[213] Swift cast as Bombalurina in the movie adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webber\'s musical Cats (2019).[214] She recorded and released ""Beautiful Ghosts"", an original song she wrote with Webber for the film\'s soundtrack in November 2019.[215] Although critics reviewed the film negatively, Swift\'s role received positive feedback.[216] Her documentary Miss Americana premiered at the 2020 Sundance Film Festival and was released on Netflix on January 31.[217][218] The documentary features the song ""Only the Young"", which Swift wrote after the 2018 United States elections.[219] In February 2020, Swift signed an exclusive global publishing deal with Universal Music Publishing Group, after her 16-year-old contract with Sony/ATV Music Publishing expired.[220] Footage from Swift\'s 2019 City of Lover concert in Paris, which was part of a promotion campaign for her album Lover, aired on ABC on May 17, 2020. Swift released live versions of the Lover tracks she performed at the concert after the television special\'s premiere.[221]\n\nSwift\'s eighth studio album, Folklore, was a surprise album released on July 24, 2020.[222] Written and recorded while Swift was in isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic, the album included collaborations with Bon Iver, Aaron Dessner, and Jack Antonoff.[223] The album\'s indie folk production and Swift\'s vivid lyrics received critical acclaim.[224] Folklore sold two million units worldwide within its first week[225] and broke the record for first-day album streams by a female artist on Spotify.[226] The lead single ""Cardigan"" debuted atop the Billboard Hot 100, making Swift the first artist to debut atop both the Billboard 200 and Hot 100 in the same week.[227] Other singles from the album were Billboard Hot 100 top-10 entries ""Exile"" and ""The 1"",[123] and country radio single ""Betty"".[228] At the 2020 American Music Awards, Swift won three awards, including Artist of the Year for a record third consecutive time.[229] On November 25, Swift released the self-directed concert film Folklore: The Long Pond Studio Sessions on Disney+.[230] At the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards, Swift received six nominations, including Album of the Year.[231]\n\nArtistry\n\nInfluences\n\nOne of Swift\'s earliest musical memories is listening to her maternal grandmother, Marjorie Finlay, sing in church.[6] As a child, she enjoyed Disney film soundtracks: ""My parents noticed that, once I had run out of words, I would just make up my own"".[232] Swift has said she owes her confidence to her mother, who helped her prepare for class presentations as a child.[233] She also attributes her ""fascination with writing and storytelling"" to her mother.[234] Swift was drawn to the storytelling aspect of country music,[235] and was introduced to the genre listening to ""the great female country artists of the \'90s""\xe2\x80\x94Shania Twain, Faith Hill, and the Dixie Chicks.""[236][237] Twain, both as a songwriter and performer, was her biggest musical influence.[238] Hill was Swift\'s childhood role model: ""Everything she said, did, wore, I tried to copy it"".[239] She admired the Dixie Chicks\' defiant attitude and their ability to play their own instruments.[240] The band\'s ""Cowboy Take Me Away"" was the first song Swift learned to play on the guitar.[241] Swift also explored the music of older country stars, including Patsy Cline, Loretta Lynn, Dolly Parton, and Tammy Wynette.[20] She believes Parton is ""an amazing example to every female songwriter out there"".[242] Alt-country artists like Patty Griffin[243] and Lori McKenna have also inspired Swift.[10]\n\nSwift has also been influenced by various pop and rock artists. She lists Paul McCartney, the Rolling Stones,[138] Bruce Springsteen, Bryan Adams,[244] Emmylou Harris, Kris Kristofferson, and Carly Simon as her career role models. Discussing McCartney and Harris, Swift has said, ""They\'ve taken chances, but they\'ve also been the same artist for their entire careers"".[10][245] McCartney, both as a Beatle and a solo artist, makes Swift feel ""as if I\'ve been let into his heart and his mind [...] He\'s out there continuing to make his fans so happy. Any musician could only dream of a legacy like that.""[246] She likes Springsteen for being ""so musically relevant after such a long period of time"".[247] She aspires to be like Harris as she grows older because of prioritizing music over fame.[248] Swift says of Kristofferson that he ""shines in songwriting"",[249] and admires Simon for being ""an emotional"" but ""a strong person"".[250] Her synth-pop album 1989 was influenced by some of her favorite 1980s pop acts, including Peter Gabriel, Annie Lennox, Phil Collins and Madonna.[251][252] Swift named Pete Wentz and Lana Del Rey as her favorite lyricists.[253]\n\nMusical style\n\nSwift\'s music consists primarily of elements of pop,[254] synth-pop,[255] country,[256] country pop[257] and rock.[255] Her later works draw from genres such as indie folk,[258] alternative rock,[259] R&B,[260][261] EDM,[262] hip hop[263] and trap.[264] Swift described herself as a country artist until the release of 1989 (2014), which she characterized as her first ""sonically cohesive pop album"".[265] Rolling Stone wrote, ""[Swift] might get played on the country station, but she\'s one of the few genuine rock stars we\'ve got these days.""[266] According to The New York Times, ""There isn\'t much in Ms. Swift\'s music to indicate country\xe2\x80\x94a few banjo strums, a pair of cowboy boots worn onstage, a bedazzled guitar\xe2\x80\x94but there\'s something in her winsome, vulnerable delivery that\'s unique to Nashville.""[267] The Guardian wrote that Swift ""cranks melodies out with the pitiless efficiency of a Scandinavian pop factory.""[268]\n\nSwift\'s singing voice was described by Sophie Schillaci of The Hollywood Reporter as ""sweet, but soft"".[269] The Los Angeles Times identified Swift\'s ""defining"" vocal gesture in studio recordings as ""the line that slides down like a contented sigh or up like a raised eyebrow, giving her beloved girl-time hits their air of easy intimacy"".[270] Rolling Stone, in a Speak Now review, wrote: ""Swift\'s voice is unaffected enough to mask how masterful she has become as a singer; she lowers her voice for the payoff lines in the classic mode of a shy girl trying to talk tough.""[271] In another review of Speak Now, The Village Voice wrote that her phrasing was previously ""bland and muddled, but that\'s changed. She can still sound strained and thin, and often strays into a pitch that drives some people crazy; but she\'s learned how to make words sound like what they mean.""[272] NPR Music described her singing as personal and conversational thanks to her ""exceptional gift for inflection"", but also suffers from a ""wobbly pitch and tight, nasal delivery"".[273] The Hollywood Reporter wrote that her live vocals are ""fine"", but they do not match those of her peers.[269] Swift has been praised for refusing to correct her pitch with Auto-Tune.[274] Swift is a mezzo-soprano.[275]\n\nIn an interview with The New Yorker, Swift characterized herself primarily as a songwriter: ""I write songs, and my voice is just a way to get those lyrics across.""[10] A writer for The Tennessean conceded in 2010 that Swift is ""not the best technical singer"", but described her as the ""best communicator that we\'ve got"".[276] Swift\'s vocal presence is something that concerns her and she has ""put a lot of work"" into improving it.[277] It was reported in 2010 that she continues to take vocal lessons.[278] She has said that she only feels nervous performing ""if I\'m not sure what the audience thinks of me, like at award shows"".[279]\n\nSongwriting\n\nSwift uses her life experiences as an inspiration in her work.[280] She often addresses the ""anonymous crushes of her high school years"" and celebrities in her early songs.[281] Swift frequently criticizes ex-boyfriends,[282] an aspect of her songwriting downplayed by The Village Voice: ""Being told What Songs Mean is like having a really pushy professor. And it imperils a true appreciation of Swift\'s talent, which is not confessional, but dramatic.""[283] However, New York believes the media scrutiny over her decision to ""mine her personal life for music ... is sexist, inasmuch as it\'s not asked of her male peers"".[284] Swift said that not all of her songs are factual, and they are sometimes based on observations[285] or fictional narratives.[286] Aside from clues provided in her liner notes, Swift tries not to talk about song subjects specifically ""because these are real people. You try to give insight as to where you were coming from as a writer without completely throwing somebody under the bus.""[287]\n\nSwift during her Speak Now World Tour in Pittsburgh , 2011\n\nFor a female to write about her feelings, and then be portrayed as some clingy, insane, desperate girlfriend in need of making you marry her and have kids with her, I think that\'s taking something that potentially should be celebrated\xe2\x80\x94a woman writing about her feelings in a confessional way\xe2\x80\x94that\'s taking it and turning it and twisting it into something that is frankly a little sexist. Swift in response to criticism of her songwriting[288]\n\nThe Guardian has praised Swift for writing about teenage years ""with a kind of wistful, sepia-toned nostalgia"" over the course of her first two albums.[268] New York has remarked that many singer-songwriters have made great records as teens, but ""none made great records so explicitly about their teens"". The magazine has also compared her work to Brian Wilson.[289] In Fearless, Swift featured fairy tale imagery and explored the disconnect ""between fairy tales and the reality of love"".[290] Her later albums address more adult relationships.[245] In addition to romance and love, Swift\'s songs have discussed parent-child relationships, friendships,[291][292] alienation, fame, and career ambitions.[234] Swift frequently includes ""a tossed-off phrase to suggest large and serious things that won\'t fit in the song, things that enhance or subvert the surface narrative"".[293]\n\nRolling Stone describes Swift as ""a songwriting savant with an intuitive gift for verse-chorus-bridge architecture"".[294] According to The Village Voice, she often uses third-verse point of view reversals.[293] In terms of imagery, repetition is evident in Swift\'s songwriting. In The Guardian\'s words, ""she spends so much time kissin\' in the rain that it seems a miracle she hasn\'t developed trenchfoot"".[268] Slant Magazine adds, ""to Swift\'s credit, she explores new lyrical motifs over the course of [her fourth] album"".[295] Although reviews of Swift\'s work are ""almost uniformly positive"", The New Yorker has said she is generally portrayed ""more as a skilled technician than as a Dylanesque visionary"".[10]\n\nMusic videos\n\nSwift has collaborated with many different directors to produce her music videos, and over time she has become more involved with writing and directing. She has her own production house, Taylor Swift Productions, Inc., which is credited with producing music videos for singles such as ""Me!"",[296] and is known for hiding elaborate clues and easter eggs in most of her work.[297] In 2010, Swift co-directed the music video for ""Mine"" with Roman White.[298] In 2011, she continued to collaborate with White on the music videos for ""Mean"" and ""Ours"". Swift developed the concept and treatment for ""Mean"".[299] In an interview, White elaborated that Swift ""was keenly involved in writing the treatment, casting and wardrobe. And she stayed for both the 15-hour shooting days, even when she wasn\'t in the scenes.""[300] Swift wrote the concept for the ""Ours"" music video and then brought in White to direct, describing her vision of both videos as being ""storylines"".[301][302]\n\nFrom 2014 to 2018, Swift collaborated with director Joseph Kahn on eight music videos\xe2\x80\x94four each from her albums 1989 and Reputation. Kahn has praised Swift\'s involvement in the craft.[303] In 2016, Swift worked with American Express for her ""Blank Space"" music video (which Kahn directed), and released the interactive app AMEX Unstaged: Taylor Swift Experience. Swift received starring and executive producer credit, and in 2015 won a Primetime Emmy Award in the Outstanding Interactive Program category for the app.[304] She received producing credit in her music video for ""Bad Blood"".[305] Swift developed the concept, wrote the treatment for, and starred in the music video for the Sugarland song ""Babe"" (2018).[306] She has emerged as a music video director, co-directing the music videos for three Lover singles: ""Me!"" with Dave Meyers, and ""You Need to Calm Down"" and ""Lover"" with Drew Kirsch.[307][308] She co-executive produced the second of them with Todrick Hall.[309] She was the sole director of the videos for ""The Man"" and ""Cardigan"".[310][311]\n\nPublic image\n\nSwift\'s personal life has been the subject of widespread media attention.[312] In 2013, Abercrombie & Fitch marketed a slogan T-shirt with a ""slut-shaming"" remark directed toward her.[313] The New York Times asserted in 2013 that her ""dating history has begun to stir what feels like the beginning of a backlash"". They questioned whether Swift was in the midst of a ""quarter-life crisis"".[314] Swift is unwilling to publicly discuss her personal life;[312] she believes that talking about it can be ""a career weakness"".[315] In 2015, singer Ray Stevens released his album Here We Go Again which included the single ""Taylor Swift Is Stalkin\' Me"".[316]\n\nRolling Stone remarked upon her polite manner: ""If this is Swift\'s game face, it must be tattooed on because it never drops"",[31] and noted her ""ease with glad-handing"".[39] The Hollywood Reporter described Swift as ""the Best People Person since Bill Clinton"".[317] While presenting Swift with an award for her humanitarian endeavors in 2012, Michelle Obama described her as an artist who ""has rocketed to the top of the music industry but still keeps her feet on the ground, someone who has shattered every expectation of what a 22-year-old can accomplish"".[318] Swift considers Obama to be a role model.[319] According to The New York Times and marketing executive Matt B. Britton, Swift\'s business savvy has helped her ""excel as an authentic personality who establishes direct connections with her audience"", ""touch as many people as possible"", and ""generate a kind of advocacy and excitement that no level of advertising could"".[320]\n\nSwift is one of the most-followed people on social media;[321] as of September 2020, she has over 140 million followers on Instagram,[322] 87 million followers on Twitter[323] and 39 million subscribers on YouTube.[324] She is known for her frequent and friendly online interactions with her fans.[325][326] She has visited fans in hospitals[327][328] and delivered holiday gifts to them by mail and in person, an event dubbed ""Swiftmas"",[329] and considers it her ""responsibility"" to be conscious of her influence on young fans.[330] She has called her relationship with her fans ""the longest and best"" she has ever had.[331] Often labeled by the media as ""America\'s Sweetheart"",[332][333] a sobriquet based on her down-to-earth personality[334][335] and girl-next-door image,[336][337] Swift insists she does not ""live by all these rigid, weird rules that make me feel all fenced in. I just like the way that I feel like, and that makes me feel very free"".[338] She refuses to take part in overly-sexualized photo shoots,[339] although Bloomberg L.P. views her as a sex symbol.[340] She has been recognized as a fashion icon;[341][342] Vogue named her an Icon of American Style in 2011.[343] In 2014, she topped People\'s annual best-dressed list.[344] In 2015, she was named Woman of the Year at the Elle Style Awards[345] and ranked first on Maxim\'s Hot 100 list.[346]\n\nImpact and legacy\n\nSwift\'s early success as a country singer-songwriter plays an important role in shaping the modern country music scene. New York journalist Jody Rosen asserts that Swift is the first country artist whose success reaches the world beyond the United States.[347] Following Swift\'s rise to fame, country labels have become more interested in signing young singers who write their own music.[348] With her autobiographical narratives revolving around romance and heartbreak\xe2\x80\x94which defy traditionally conservative values represented in country music[347]\xe2\x80\x94Swift introduces the genre to a younger generation that could relate to her personal struggles.[349] Her onstage performance with guitars contributed to the ""Taylor Swift factor"", a phenomenon to which media outlets attribute the rise in guitar sales to women, a previously ignored demographic.[350][351]\n\nSwift\'s success in the 2010s, particularly in terms of record sales, cemented her power as a leading figure in the music industry.[352][353] Although Swift\'s image has transitioned from country to pop, her narrative songwriting, nurtured by her country background, offers a sense of authenticity that retains significant devotion from young audiences.[347][354] Buoyed by her strong fan base, Swift is the only artist to have four albums sell over a million copies within one week since Nielsen SoundScan started tracking sales for the Billboard 200 in 1991, a remarkable feat following the decline of the album era.[352] For New York magazine, Swift\'s million-selling albums, amidst an influx of streaming and a continuous decline in traditional album sales, prove that she is ""the one bending the music industry to her will.""[353] According to Rolling Stone, Swift\'s opposition to low-royalty streaming services and efforts to claim rights to her masters were two of the defining moments for the music industry in the 2010s decade.[355] Her actions have fostered debate over reforms to on-demand music streaming and prompted awareness of intellectual property rights among younger musicians.[356][357][358]\n\nIn 2019, Swift was named Woman of the Decade of the 2010s by Billboard[359] and became the first woman to earn the title Artist of the Decade (2010s) at the American Music Awards.[360] Musician Jack Antonoff cited Swift as the main reason why he started producing music.[361] Swift and her work have influenced various recording artists, including Kelsea Ballerini,[362] Shamir Bailey,[363] Bailey Bryan,[364] Ruth B.,[365] Camila Cabello,[366] Sabrina Carpenter,[367] The Chainsmokers,[368] Girl in Red,[369] Selena Gomez,[370] Ellie Goulding,[371] Conan Gray,[372] Halsey,[373] Niall Horan,[374] Shawn Mendes,[375] Maren Morris,[376] Nina Nesbitt,[377] Niki,[378] Finneas O\'Connell,[379] Katy Perry,[380] Olivia Rodrigo,[381] Tegan and Sara,[382] Troye Sivan,[383] and the Vamps.[384]\n\nAwards and achievements\n\nSwift has won 10 Grammy Awards,[385] an Emmy Award,[386] 32 American Music Awards (most wins by an artist),[387] 23 Billboard Music Awards (most wins by a female artist),[388] seven Guinness World Records,[389] 12 Country Music Association Awards (including the Pinnacle Award),[390] eight Academy of Country Music Awards,[391] and a Brit Award.[162] As a songwriter, she has been honored by the Nashville Songwriters Association[55][392] and the Songwriters Hall of Fame, and was the youngest person included on Rolling Stone\'s list of the 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time in 2015.[393][394] At the 64th BMI Awards in 2016, Swift was the first woman to be honored with an award named after its recipient.[395] Her albums Red and 1989 featured on Rolling Stone\'s 2020 revision of their 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.[396]\n\nSwift has sold over 50 million albums, including 37.3 million in the U.S., and 150 million singles worldwide.[397][398][399] She has amassed more than 97 million units in global album consumption, including 54 billion streams, as of February 2020.[400][401][402] In 2019, Billboard placed Swift eighth on its Greatest of All Time Artists Chart.[403] She is the woman with the most cumulative weeks (48) atop the Billboard 200[404] and the highest certified female digital singles artist in the U.S., with a total of 134 million units certified by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).[405] She is the first female artist to have both an album (Fearless) and a song (""Shake It Off"") certified Diamond by the RIAA.[406] The top female touring artist of the 2010s,[407] she broke the record for the highest-grossing U.S. tour of all time with her Reputation Stadium Tour (2018).[408]\n\nSwift has appeared in various power listings.

"b'\xe2\x80\x9cBye Bye Birdie Live\xe2\x80\x9d won\xe2\x80\x99t be taking flight on NBC until 2019 at the earliest.\n\nNBC\xe2\x80\x99s planned live event production of the classic musical with Jennifer Lopez in the lead role has been delayed for a second time due to the difficulty of coordinating with Lopez\xe2\x80\x99s busy schedule, Variety has learned exclusively. The project was originally slated to be NBC\xe2\x80\x99s holiday musical event for winter 2017 but was pushed to 2018 last May because of Lopez\xe2\x80\x99s schedule.\n\nLopez is shooting two movies later this year, plus she has a host of other commitments to NBC. She\xe2\x80\x99s the exec producer and a judge on the Peacock\xe2\x80\x99s summer unscripted series \xe2\x80\x9cWorld of Dance,\xe2\x80\x9d and she stars in the police drama \xe2\x80\x9cShades of Blue.\xe2\x80\x9d On top of her film and TV work, Lopez is committed to finishing the last lap of her Las Vegas residency at Planet Hollywood Resort and Casino in September.\n\nNBC is gearing up for the ambitious April 1 live staging of \xe2\x80\x9cJesus Christ Superstar Live in Concert\xe2\x80\x9d with the hope of drawing a big crowd on Easter Sunday. That production has also complicated planning for \xe2\x80\x9cBye Bye Birdie\xe2\x80\x9d because it is being shepherded by Craig Zadan and Neil Meron, the executive producers behind all of NBC\xe2\x80\x99s live musicals to date. By the time the work on \xe2\x80\x9cSuperstar\xe2\x80\x9d is finished, the producers would have less than six months to get \xe2\x80\x9cBirdie\xe2\x80\x9d on its feet if the show were to stick with its targeted December airdate.\n\nMoreover, NBC\xe2\x80\x99s live musicals are a big investment for the Peacock. The elaborate staging plan for \xe2\x80\x9cSuperstar\xe2\x80\x9d involves a company of 70-plus actors and musicians and an audience of 1,300 at Brooklyn\xe2\x80\x99s Marcy Armory. Pulling off two large-scale legit live events in the same year would probably be a budget-buster for the network.\n\nBut with \xe2\x80\x9cBirdie\xe2\x80\x9d moving again, it\xe2\x80\x99s understood that there is an effort under way to come up with a project to fill the void rather than have NBC go two years in a row without a live holiday event. But it\xe2\x80\x99s unclear whether the projects under consideration would have the same scope as NBC\xe2\x80\x99s past productions.\n\nNBC\xe2\x80\x99s four previous live events \xe2\x80\x94 2013\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cThe Sound of Music Live,\xe2\x80\x9d 2014\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cPeter Pan Live,\xe2\x80\x9d 2015\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cThe Wiz Live,\xe2\x80\x9d and 2016\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cHairspray Live\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 all aired in early December. This past December, Fox moved into the void with a tuner production of \xe2\x80\x9cA Christmas Story\xe2\x80\x9d that drew mixed reviews and modest ratings.\n\nNBC has also been working on plans for a live staging of the Aaron Sorkin play \xe2\x80\x9cA Few Good Men.\xe2\x80\x9d That project, also exec produced by Zadan and Meron, is unlikely to surface before 2019. Sorkin\xe2\x80\x99s awards-season schedule with the film \xe2\x80\x9cMolly\xe2\x80\x99s Game,\xe2\x80\x9d which marked his feature directorial debut, made it hard for the multi-hyphenate to focus on his teleplay adaptation of the courtroom drama that put him on the map as a scribe in 1989.'"

"b'Wedding of British royal Prince Harry to Meghan Markle\n\nThe wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle was held on 19 May 2018 in St George\'s Chapel at Windsor Castle in the United Kingdom. The groom, Prince Harry, is a member of the British royal family; the bride, Meghan Markle, is American and previously worked as an actress.[note 1] On the morning of the wedding, Prince Harry\'s grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, conferred upon him the titles of Duke of Sussex, Earl of Dumbarton and Baron Kilkeel.\n\nOn her marriage, Markle became Duchess of Sussex,[1] Countess of Dumbarton[2] and Baroness Kilkeel.[3] The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, officiated at the wedding using the standard Anglican church service for Holy Matrimony published in Common Worship, the liturgical text of the Church of England.[4][5] The traditional ceremony was noted for the inclusion of African American culture.[6]\n\nAnnouncement of engagement [ edit ]\n\nPrince Harry is the second son of Charles, Prince of Wales, and Diana, Princess of Wales. He and Meghan Markle, an American actress best known for her role in the Canadian-American legal-drama television series Suits, began their relationship in 2016 after having met in July of that year.[7] The relationship was officially acknowledged on 8 November 2016, when a statement was released from the royal family\'s communications secretary addressing the ""wave of abuse and harassment"" directed toward Markle.[8]\n\nHarry and Meghan attending church on Christmas Day, 2017\n\nOn 27 November 2017, Clarence House announced that Prince Harry would marry Markle in the spring of 2018.[9] They were engaged earlier the same month in London, with the Prince giving Markle a bespoke engagement ring made by Cleave and Company, the court jewellers and medalists to the Queen, consisting of a large central diamond from Botswana, with two smaller diamonds from his mother\'s jewellery collection.[10][note 2] At the same time, it was announced that they would live at Nottingham Cottage in the grounds of Kensington Palace following their marriage.[13]\n\nThe Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh expressed their delight at the news, while congratulations came in from various political leaders, including the British Prime Minister, Theresa May, and the Leader of the Opposition, Jeremy Corbyn. After the announcement, the couple gave an exclusive interview to Mishal Husain of BBC News.[13]\n\nDuring the public announcement of the engagement at Kensington Palace\'s Sunken Gardens, Markle wore a bottle knee-length emerald green dress with bow detailing at the cinched waist by Italian label P.A.R.O.S.H and a white trench coat by Canadian brand Line the Label.[14][15] Hours after the announcement, the website of Line the Label crashed down due to the number of people who were trying to order the coat.[10][16]\n\nMarkle is the second American[note 3] and the first person of mixed race heritage to marry into the British royal family.[17] The engagement announcement prompted much comment about the possible social significance of Markle becoming a proudly mixed-race royal.[18][19][20][21][22]\n\nUnder the terms of the Succession to the Crown Act 2013, the first six persons in the line of succession require the Sovereign\'s consent in order to marry. Harry was fifth in line at the time of his engagement.[23] The Queen\'s consent was declared to the Privy Council of the United Kingdom on 14 March 2018.[24][25]\n\nAlthough Markle attended a private Catholic school in her early years, she is not Roman Catholic.[26] On 6 March 2018, she was baptised and confirmed into the Church of England by the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby at St. James\'s Palace.[27] Although Markle was divorced, the Anglican Church has permitted marriage to divorced persons with a living former spouse since 2002.[28][29] After the engagement, Markle began the years-long process of becoming a British citizen.[30] She will retain her U.S. citizenship during the process,[31] but Kensington Palace have indicated that the decision on whether she will retain dual nationality has not yet been made.[30] Retaining U.S. citizenship is expected to create tax complications.[32] The couple was invited to celebrate Christmas 2017 with the royal family at the Queen\'s Sandringham estate.[33] The official engagement photographs were taken by Alexi Lubomirski (a former assistant to Mario Testino) at Frogmore House, and were issued by Kensington Palace on 21 December 2017.[34]\n\nTo mark the wedding of Harry and Meghan, the Royal Mint produced an official UK \xc2\xa35 coin, showing the couple in profile.[35] In May, a set of commemorative postage stamps, featuring the couple\'s official engagement photographs, was issued by Royal Mail.[36]\n\nWedding [ edit ]\n\nPlanning [ edit ]\n\nPreparation for wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\n\nUnlike the wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton, the wedding day of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle was not declared a bank holiday.[37] The wedding was on the same date as the FA Cup Final, which Prince Harry\'s brother William normally attends in his role as President of the Football Association.[38] Holding the royal wedding on a weekend is a break with the royal tradition of having weddings on a weekday.[39] On 12 February 2018, Kensington Palace announced that the ceremony would commence at 12:00 Midday BST.\n\nVenue [ edit ]\n\nThe wedding took place on Saturday, 19 May 2018, at St George\'s Chapel, Windsor.[40] The chapel had previously been the venue for the weddings of Prince Harry\'s uncle, the Earl of Wessex, as well as that of his cousin, Peter Phillips, and for the blessing of the marriage of the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall, Harry\'s stepmother.[41]\n\nCost [ edit ]\n\nThe royal family announced that they would pay for the wedding.[42] The costs for the cake, the florist, and the catering had been estimated to be \xc2\xa350,000, \xc2\xa3110,000, and \xc2\xa3286,000 respectively,[43] and the overall cost was expected to be around \xc2\xa332 million.[44] The security costs were expected to be lower than those of the 2011 wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.[45] By the end of May, it was estimated that the security costs were ""between \xc2\xa32 million and \xc2\xa34 million"". The police and crime commissioner could also apply for special funding if the costs were to exceed 1% of the Thames Valley Police force\'s annual budget, but at the time the cost was ""well below the \xc2\xa34 million required to make a claim"".[46] The Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead reportedly spent \xc2\xa32.6 million on cleaning the town and roads.[45] It was predicted that the wedding would trigger a tourism boom and boost the economy by up to \xc2\xa3500 million.[47]\n\nWedding attire [ edit ]\n\nThe wedding invitations specified a dress code for men of ""Dress Uniform, Morning Coat or Lounge Suit""; for women, ""Day Dress and Hat"".[48]\n\nBride and bridesmaids [ edit ]\n\nThe wedding dress was designed by the British designer Clare Waight Keller under the aegis of the fashion house Givenchy.[49] It was made of ""double-bonded silk cady cushioned by an underskirt in triple silk organza"" and had a boat neckline, long sleeves and sweeping train.[50][51] The silk veil was 16 feet (4.9 m) long and was embroidered with 55 flowers, representing the 53 countries of the Commonwealth,[50][52] as well as Wintersweet, which grows in front of Nottingham Cottage, where she and Harry live, and the California Poppy, the state flower of California.[53] It was secured by a diamond bandeau tiara, made in 1932 for Queen Mary and lent to Markle by Queen Elizabeth II.[50][54] The centre brooch had been a wedding gift from the County of Lincoln in 1893. The tiara is a platinum band, made up of eleven sections, a detachable centre brooch with interlaced opals and diamonds.[55] The shoes were also from Givenchy, and had a pointed couture design.[50]\n\nOther ensembles worn by the bride included white gold and diamond earrings and bracelet made by Cartier.[50][54][56] Markle\'s hair was rolled up with ""face-framing fringe tucked behind her ears"",[57] and was done by Serge Normant.[58] Dior make-up artist Daniel Martin did Markle\'s makeup for the occasion.[57][59] The look was described as ""a soft brown eyeshadow"" with minimal makeup on the face.[57] Her nails were painted in a ""neutral pink-y beige"" for the ceremony.[60] The bride\'s bouquet, designed by Philippa Craddock, contained ""forget-me-nots, scented sweet peas, lily of the valley, astilbe, jasmine and astrantia, and sprigs of myrtle"".[50] The flowers were chosen by the groom who handpicked forget-me-nots in honour of his late mother Diana, Princess of Wales.[50][61]\n\nAfter the wedding the bridal bouquet was placed on the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior at Westminster Abbey, following royal tradition that began with the Queen Mother.[62] For the customary bridal themes of ""Something old, something new, something borrowed, something blue"", Markle had her dress and veil (the ""new""), the Queen\'s tiara (the ""borrowed""), sprigs of myrtle taken from ""a plant grown from the myrtle used in the Queen\'s wedding bouquet"" and a piece of fabric from Diana, Princess of Wales\'s wedding dress (the ""old""), and finally a piece of fabric from the dress she wore on their first date stitched in the veil (the ""blue"").[63][64][65] The young bridesmaids also wore high-waisted silk dresses designed by Clare Waight Keller which had puff sleeves.[66]\n\nGroom, best man and page boys [ edit ]\n\nPrince Harry and the Duke of Cambridge wore the frock coat uniform of the Blues and Royals (Royal Horse Guards and 1st Dragoons) in which both were commissioned,[note 4] and Prince Harry served for 10 years, including in combat in Afghanistan.[67] The uniforms were made by Dege & Skinner, gentleman\'s tailors and uniform makers, of Savile Row, London.[68][69] The groom asked for and received the Queen\'s permission to keep his beard, as beards are only permitted under exceptional circumstances in the British Army.[67] Prince Harry wore the rank of major with the star of the Royal Victorian Order, of which he is a Knight Commander, along with the ribbons of the Royal Victorian Order, Operational Service Medal for Afghanistan, Queen Elizabeth II Golden Jubilee Medal and Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal, and Army Air Corps wings.[70]\n\nPrince William, also with the rank of major, had EIIR cyphers on his shoulder straps and gold aiguillettes on his right shoulder (indicating his position as an aide-de-camp to the Queen), and wore the star of the Order of the Garter, the ribbons of the two jubilee medals, and his RAF wings.[68][71] The pageboys wore uniforms by Dege & Skinner that resembled the uniform of the Blues and Royals worn by the groom and best man. Each page boy had his initials on the shoulders in place of rank badges.[68]\n\nWedding party [ edit ]\n\nOn 26 April 2018, Kensington Palace announced that Prince Harry had selected his older brother, Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, as his best man.[72][73] There was initially no confirmation as to whether Prince William would miss the FA Cup Final, which he would normally attend in his role as President of The Football Association, or if he would be able to attend both the wedding and the football. A statement from Kensington Palace that the timing of the wedding would not clash with the match was released in December 2017.[74] However, it was confirmed in March that the Duke would not be attending the final that day.[75]\n\nThere were suggestions that the bride\'s friend Jessica Mulroney, daughter-in-law of former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, would be her maid of honour.[76][77] In early May 2018, there was confirmation that there would be no maid of honour, and that the bridesmaids and page boys would all be children.[78] A total of ten bridesmaids and page boys were chosen, with the bride and groom each selecting five: two of Markle\'s godchildren, seven-year old Rylan Litt and her six-year-old sister Remi, as well as Brian, John and Ivy Mulroney, the three children of her friend Jessica Mulroney, were chosen by the bride, while Prince Harry\'s nephew and niece, Prince George and Princess Charlotte of Cambridge, as well as his godchildren Florence van Cutsem, Zalie Warren and Jasper Dyer, were selected by the groom.[79][80]\n\nOn 18 May 2018, Kensington Palace announced Prince Charles would accompany Markle down the aisle, after she confirmed her father, Thomas Markle Sr., would not be attending the wedding due to his recent heart surgery.[81][82] The bride spent the night before the wedding at Cliveden House along with her mother, while the groom stayed at Coworth Park Hotel with his brother.[83][84] Markle made her way to the church accompanied by her mother.[85]\n\nApproximately 250 members of the British Armed Forces were involved in the wedding, the majority coming from units that have a connection with Prince Harry:[86]\n\nWedding service [ edit ]\n\nThe wedding service was conducted according to the Christian liturgy for Holy Matrimony as set out in Common Worship of the Church of England, mother Church of the Anglican Communion.[5]\n\nFrom 8.00 am, the public started to arrive at the grounds of Windsor Castle. The main congregation and the guests[89] all started to arrive at the chapel at 9.30 am, followed by members of the Royal Family. The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh were the last members of the Royal Family to depart for the ceremony, as is tradition, arriving at the chapel at 11.52 am.[90] Shortly after, Markle arrived with the party of junior attendants. She proceeded down the aisle followed by the attendants, where the Prince of Wales met her to escort her through the quire of the chapel. He accompanied her to the altar, where Prince Harry was standing.[91][92]\n\nPrince Harry\'s maternal aunt, Baroness Fellowes, read a scripture lesson from The Song of Solomon in the Christian Bible. The Dean of Windsor, David Conner, conducted the service with the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, performing the marriage ceremony. The sermon was delivered by The Most Reverend Michael Curry, presiding bishop and primate of the Episcopal Church (the American member church of the Anglican Communion).[93][94] Curry\'s 14-minute address, which quoted Martin Luther King Jr., emphasised the redemptive property of love.[95][96] Chaplain to the Queen The Reverend Prebendary Rose Hudson-Wilkin and Coptic Orthodox Archbishop of London Anba Angaelos offered the prayers.[97]\n\nThe marriage vows were those published in Common Worship, and included the promise ""to love and to cherish"" each other.[98] This was sealed by the exchange of rings.[98] The wedding rings were created by Cleave and Company, with Markle\'s ring being fashioned out of Welsh gold and the Prince\'s ring made of platinum.[99] After the signing of the registers, Harry and Markle together with the guests sang the national anthem. The couple paused briefly to bow and curtsey to the Queen before walking down the aisle.[100] They were followed in procession by other members of the bridal party, and their families.[98] The couple shared a kiss on the steps outside the chapel.[101]\n\nOrder of Service [ edit ]\n\nWorks are performed by the Choir of St. George\'s Chapel and/or the wedding\'s orchestra, unless otherwise stated\n\nMusic [ edit ]\n\nHymns sung at the wedding included Lord of All Hopefulness and Guide Me, O Thou Great Redeemer.[102] Prince Harry was seen wiping away a tear during the congregational singing of the latter, which was a favourite of his mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, and was sung at her funeral in 1997;[103] it was also the opening hymn to William\'s wedding in 2011.\n\nTwo choirs, an orchestra, the chapel organ and fanfare trumpeters provided music for the service. The orchestra was made up of musicians from the BBC National Orchestra of Wales, the English Chamber Orchestra and the Philharmonia Orchestra. In addition to the Choir of St George\'s Chapel, the Kingdom Choir, a gospel group led by Karen Gibson, sang ""Stand By Me"" in what was described as ""an incredible and powerful moment"", as the couple were sitting down.[104] The State Trumpeters of the Household Cavalry, who played a fanfare, included Kate Sandford, the first female state trumpeter at a British royal wedding.[105] The music was under the overall direction of James Vivian, the chapel\'s Organist and Director of Music; and the orchestra was conducted by Christopher Warren-Green.[106][107]\n\nThe bride walked down the aisle to ""Eternal source of light divine"" (from the Ode for the Birthday of Queen Anne) by Handel, sung by soprano Elin Manahan Thomas, with the trumpet obbligato performed by David Blackadder.[108] Other music during the service included the motet ""If Ye Love Me"" by Thomas Tallis; the song ""Stand by Me"" by Jerry Leiber, Mike Stoller and Ben E. King, arranged for choir by Mark Delisser; and ""The Lord bless you and keep you"" by John Rutter. During the signing of the register, 19-year-old cellist Sheku Kanneh-Mason and the orchestra played Sicilienne attributed to Maria Theresia von Paradis, Faur\xc3\xa9\'s Apr\xc3\xa8s un r\xc3\xaave, and an arrangement for cello and orchestra of Schubert\'s Ave Maria. For the procession, the musicians performed the Allegro from the Symphony No. 1 in B-flat major by William Boyce and ""This Little Light of Mine"" by Etta James, Jester Hairston and Harry Dixon Loes.[109]\n\nFamily celebrations [ edit ]\n\nSt George\'s Hall, Windsor Castle Frogmore House\n\nFollowing the ceremony, there was a carriage procession through Windsor. Two receptions were held; the first, for those attending the ceremony, was hosted by the Queen and took place in St George\'s Hall after the carriage procession. Singer Elton John performed for the guests, and the groom and the Prince of Wales each gave a speech.[67] A second reception at Frogmore House, for family and close friends and hosted by the Prince of Wales, occurred later in the day.[93] Harry drove his new wife to the reception at Frogmore in a loaned silver blue Jaguar E-Type Concept Zero.\n\nFor the evening reception, the Duchess of Sussex wore a halter-neck, open back dress by Stella McCartney and an emerald cut Aquamarine ring formerly belonging to Diana, Princess of Wales.[110][111] George Northwood was her hairstylist for the private party.[111] In a break with tradition, the bride made a speech at the event.[67] The Duke of Cambridge also gave a best man\'s speech. DJ Idris Elba and The Atlantic Soul Orchestra performed at the event.[112][113][114] The event ended with small fireworks displayed above Frogmore House.[115]\n\nThe wedding cake was a layered lemon and elderflower cake and decorated with peonies in shades of white and cream.[116] The cake designer Claire Ptak, based in London, was chosen in March 2018.[117]\n\nThree official wedding photos were released. They were taken by photographer Alexi Lubomirski at Windsor Castle following the ceremony.[118]\n\nGuests [ edit ]\n\nIn April 2018, it was announced that an ""official list"" of domestic and international political leaders was not required for the wedding and that Prime Minister Theresa May, Leader of the Opposition Jeremy Corbyn, and other leaders would not attend the ceremony. President of the United States Donald Trump and former president Barack Obama were also not invited.[119] This was in contrast to the wedding of Prince Harry\'s elder brother, which had a large number of such guests due to his position as a future monarch.[120] The decision not to invite political leaders to the wedding was taken in part because of the limitations of the venue, and also took into account Prince Harry\'s position as sixth in line to the throne.[120] The only politician invited was the former Prime Minister Sir John Major as he previously was ""a special guardian on legal matters to Princes William and Harry after the death of their mother"".[67]\n\nWith a smaller ceremony and reception at St George\'s Hall, the guest list included approximately 600 people, most of whom have a ""direct relationship"" with the couple.[121] Also, 200 close friends of the couple were invited to attend the evening reception at Frogmore House.[122] Approximately 1,200 members of the public were invited to greet the couple outside the chapel in the grounds of Windsor Castle.[121] The invitees outside the chapel were ""people from charities, Windsor Castle community members, people from the royal households and the Crown Estate, and local school children"".[123]\n\nSarah, Duchess of York, the former wife of Prince Andrew, was invited to the wedding even though she had not been invited to the weddings of Prince William and Catherine Middleton in 2011, Peter Phillips and Autumn Kelly in 2008, or Zara Phillips and Mike Tindall in 2011. However, she was not invited to the evening reception at Frogmore House hosted by Prince Charles and was reportedly ""deeply upset"" by her omission.[124]\n\nAmongst the non-royal guests were Markle\'s Suits co-stars Patrick J. Adams (with wife Troian Bellisario), Gabriel Macht (with wife Jacinda Barrett), Sarah Rafferty, Rick Hoffman, Gina Torres and Abigail Spencer, actors George Clooney (with wife Amal Clooney), Idris Elba and Tom Hardy, actresses Oprah Winfrey, Priyanka Chopra and Carey Mulligan (with husband Marcus Mumford), television host James Corden, tennis player Serena Williams (with husband Alexis Ohanian), David and Victoria Beckham, musicians Sir Elton John (with husband David Furnish), James Blunt, Joss Stone, and rugby players Jonny Wilkinson and James Haskell. Meghan\'s close friend, stylist Jessica Mulroney (with husband Ben Mulroney) and Harry\'s ex-girlfriends Cressida Bonas and Chelsy Davy were also in attendance. Other guests were members of the Middleton family.[125][126][127][128][129]\n\nThe only foreign royal guests at the wedding were Prince Harry\'s friend Prince Seeiso of Lesotho, with whom he co-founded, after the death of both of their mothers, the Sentebale foundation to help AIDS-stricken orphans in Lesotho, and his wife Princess Mabereng.[130]\n\nGifts for guests [ edit ]\n\nThe 2,640 members of the public invited to Windsor Castle for the wedding were gifted gift bags to commemorate the event. The bag had the initials of the couple, date and venue location printed on the exterior. Inside was an order of service booklet for the wedding, a gold chocolate coin, a bottle of water, a fridge magnet, a 20% off voucher for the Windsor Castle gift shop and a tube of handbag shortbread.[131]\n\nCharitable donations [ edit ]\n\nIn April 2018, the couple requested that, rather than sending wedding gifts, people should make a donation to one of seven charitable organisations, none of which they had a formal association with:[132][133]\n\nCHIVA (Children\'s HIV Association): The small charity supports more than 1,000 young people living with HIV in the UK and Ireland.\n\nCrisis: The national homeless body works with thousands of people a year to help rebuild their lives.\n\nThe Myna Mahila Foundation: The organisation, based in Mumbai, helps empower women through offering stable employment and breaking cultural taboos around menstrual hygiene. Myna Mahila also teaches women life skills such as maths, English and self-defence.\n\nScotty\'s Little Soldiers: The charity supports children who have lost a parent while serving in the British Armed Forces.\n\nStreetGames: The organisation uses sport to help young people and communities become healthier and safer.\n\nSurfers Against Sewage: The national marine conservation body works to protect oceans, beaches, waves and wildlife.\n\nThe Wilderness Foundation UK: Vulnerable teenagers from urban communities are taught about the great outdoors and rural employment opportunities.\n\nCoverage [ edit ]\n\nPeople watching the wedding at the official residence of the UK Ambassador to Italy, in Rome\n\nPeak viewing figures of 27.7 million were reported in the UK.[134] About 29 million were reported to have watched in the United States, up from the 23 million Americans who watched the wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton.[135] The global audience was estimated to be in the hundreds of millions.[136]\n\nCoverage of the royal wedding in the UK was shown on BBC One, ITV, Sky News, CNN (International) and E! (Europe) [137] The wedding was also streamed live online on YouTube via the British Monarchy\'s official The Royal Channel.[138] Huw Edwards hosted coverage for BBC TV with Desert Island Discs host Kirsty Young and BBC Radio 2 DJ Dermot O\'Leary. The BBC Radio coverage was co-hosted by Chris Evans and Scarlett Moffatt.[139] Phillip Schofield and Julie Etchingham hosted coverage for ITV.[140] Kay Burley, Anna Botting and Alastair Bruce, among others, hosted coverage for Sky.[141] Giuliana Rancic, Sarah-Jane Crawford, Melanie Bromley and Brad Goreski hosted coverage for E!.[142]\n\nCBC broadcast the wedding in Canada with Adrienne Arsenault and retired broadcaster Peter Mansbridge presented live coverage that was simulcast on CBC Television, CBC Radio One and CBC News Network.[143] TVNZ screened it in New Zealand along with SBS and Nine in Australia.[137][144] The wedding received 4 million views in Australia.[145]\n\nIn Fiji, Fiji Television broadcast the event via BBC with coverage starting from 8:30 pm FJT on 19 May and finishing at 12:30 am on 20 May, when it switched back to normal programming.\n\nIn the United States coverage aired on CBS, NBC, ABC, E!, PBS, BBC America, TLC, FOX, and HBO.[146] CBS\'s coverage began at 4 a.m. EDT with CBS Presents ""The Royal Wedding""[147] and Gayle King provided commentary during the broadcast. ABC began its coverage at 5 a.m. EDT with a special edition of Good Morning America.[148] NBC aired the ceremony at 4:30 a.m. EDT with a special edition of The Today Show.[149] The pay subscription network HBO hosted a live broadcast titled ""The Royal Wedding Live with Cord and Tish!"" starting at 7:30 a.m. EDT.[150] The parody hosts were Cord Hosenbeck and Tish Cattigan, the alter egos of former Saturday Night Live actors Will Ferrell and Molly Shannon. BBC America provided a live simulcast of BBC One\'s coverage, albeit with limited commercial breaks.[151]\n\nThe wedding was also aired on the Republic of Ireland\'s national broadcaster RT\xc3\x89.[152]\n\nComments in a ""posh"" British accent by a self-claimed British expert on some media turned out to be by an American, Thomas Mace-Archer-Mills.[153]\n\nIn April 2020, it was announced that $112,000 in profits from the BBC broadcast of the Duke and Duchess\'s wedding would be donated to Feeding Britain amidst the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom.[154]\n\nTitles [ edit ]\n\nTraditionally, royal princes have been awarded peerages prior to their marriages; this occurred with both of Prince Harry\'s uncles, the Duke of York and the Earl of Wessex, as well as his elder brother, the Duke of Cambridge.[155] Hours before the wedding, Prince Harry was granted the titles Duke of Sussex, Earl of Dumbarton, and Baron Kilkeel, and Markle assumed the style ""Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Sussex"" upon marriage.[1]\n\nReactions [ edit ]\n\nBritish reactions to a mixed-race American marrying into the British royal family ( Voice of America\n\nThe wedding was widely reported as being significant for its departure from tradition typically associated with the royal family and for its inclusion of African-American culture in the service.[156][157][158][159][160] It was described as a ""landmark for African Americans"", for Black British, black and mixed-race women, and for the royal family itself.[161][162][163][164] Other reports cited more limited impact, including that ""Markle being biracial as opposed to African American impeded black people embracing her as one of their own"".[165][166]\n\nThe wedding, particularly Markle\'s choice of dress, as well as the cake and flowers, influenced the choices of other British brides for their weddings.[167]\n\nHoneymoon [ edit ]\n\nThe couple did not leave for their honeymoon the day after their marriage, and were both scheduled to carry out public engagements in the week after the wedding.[168] The location of the honeymoon was kept secret, although the press speculated that they might be headed to locations such as Namibia, Rwanda, and Botswana.[169][170][171]'"

"b'Lawsuit against Jim Carrey from ex-girlfriend\'s family dismissed\n\nAndrea Mandell | USA TODAY\n\nShow Caption Hide Caption Wrongful death lawsuit against Jim Carrey dismissed On Thursday, a lawsuit brought against Jim Carrey over the death of his ex-girlfriend was dismissed, according to a report by theWrap.\n\nJim Carrey is no longer facing a lawsuit from the family of his late girlfriend, Cathriona White.\n\n""The case against him has been dismissed,"" Carrey\'s attorney, Raymond Boucher, told USA TODAY.\n\nCarrey, 56, began dating makeup artist White, 30, in the summer of 2012 after they met on a film set. The Irish-born woman was found dead in a Sherman Oaks, Calif., home on Sept. 28, 2015; the Los Angeles County coroner\'s office later ruled White took her own life by overdosing on prescription drugs, including Ambien, Propranolol and Percocet (oxycodone and acetaminophen).\n\nMore: Jim Carrey countersues \'desperate characters\' after ex\'s suicide\n\nThe actor was a pallbearer at her funeral in Ireland.\n\nIn 2016, Carrey was hit with a wrongful death lawsuit from his late girlfriend\'s husband, Mark Burton, her mother, Brigid Sweetman, and their lawyer, Filippo Marchino, accusing him of illegally obtaining and giving her the powerful painkillers she used to kill herself in September 2015. They also alleged that Carrey gave White \xe2\x80\x9cthree STDs without warning her.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nCarrey countersued, saying White had tried to extort him after the two broke up in early 2013 and that he made a ""mistake"" of settling a false STD claim with her to avoid mounting a public defense, which ""is a very costly and painful process.""\n\nMore: Jim Carrey will be \'Kidding\' on new Showtime series that marks his return to TV\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter says that Carrey\'s attorney had recently asked the court to compel Burton to provide White\'s STD test results. Through discovery, Boucher came to the conclusion that a 2011 document showing White had clean test results prior to meeting Carrey was a forgery.\n\nOn Thursday, he told USA TODAY the underlying case was voluntarily dismissed by the plaintiffs, removing the possibility of Carrey, 56, going to trial.\n\nMichael Avenatti, the attorney for Sweetman and Burton, did not immediately respond to a request for comment from USA TODAY.\n\nAt the time of White\'s death, Carrey issued a statement calling her ""a truly kind and delicate Irish flower, too sensitive for this soil, to whom loving and being loved was all that sparkled.""'"

"b'\n\nJames Corden hosted the 2017 GRAMMY Awards on Sunday, in an evening filled with some touching tributes, some unusual acceptance speeches and a whole lot of Blue Ivy!\n\nFrom Beyonce\'s unbelievable and hypnotic performance to Adele\'s non-stop run of emotional wins to Lady Gaga crowd surfing for some reason, here\'s a look at the best, worst and downright weirdest moments from music\'s biggest night.\n\n\n\nWATCH: James Corden Opens GRAMMYs 2017 by Tripping Down the Stairs, Dissing Donald Trump in Epic Rap\n\n\n\n\n\nBEST MOMENTS\n\n\n\n\n\nAdele Opens the Show (With Her Ring)\n\n\n\nAfter her previous glitchy performance at the GRAMMYs, Adele returned to the stage to open this year\'s show and her flawless delivery of ""Hello"" had people in tears. However, many watching at home were just as obsessed with the sparkling band on her ring finger, adding fuel to the rumors that she secretly got engaged to -- or even married -- her boyfriend, Simon Konecki. But we were mostly fascinated about how well she hit her high notes.\n\n\n\nTwenty One Pilots Strip Down to Their Underwear, Corden Responds\n\n\n\nWhen Tyler Joseph and Josh Dun won Best Pop Duo/Group, the two artists stripped off their tuxedo pants and accepted the award in their skivvies. While the stunt seemed silly at first, it turned out there was a meaningful reason behind it all.\n\nJoseph recounted how, years before they ""were able to make any money playing music,"" he invited Dun over to his house to watch the GRAMMYs, and ""as we were watching, we noticed that every single one of us was in our underwear. Josh turned to me, and we were no one at the time, and he said, \'If we ever win a GRAMMY, we should receive it just like this. So, not only is this amazing but I want everyone watching at home to know that you could be next. Anyone from anywhere can do anything.""\n\n\n\nBeyonce\'s Psychedelic Live/Holographic Performance\n\n\n\nThe Lemonade singer, who is pregnant with twins, delivered one of the highlight performances of the night that ended up being more like art than your standard live GRAMMYs fare. Combining holograms and pre-recorded packages with a live stage presence, the trippy Golden Goddess experiment was unlike anything we\'ve seen from her (or the awards show) in the past.\n\n\n\nWATCH: Busta Rhymes Calls Donald Trump \'President Agent Orange\' in Powerful A Tribe Called Quest Performance\n\n\n\n\n\nKaty Perry Gets Political\n\n\n\nPerry delivered the debut live performance of her new single, ""Chained to the Rhythm,"" along with collaborator Skip Marley. While the song would have been fun to watch on it\'s own merit, Perry made sure to inject some bold political commentary. Aside from rocking a ""PERSIST"" arm band and a Planned Parenthood pin on her lapel, the duo ended the song by standing in front of a massive projection of the preamble to the Constitution.\n\n\n\nBruno Mars Channels Prince\n\n\n\nIn a tribute to the late star, Mars\' proved his love for Prince\'s legacy with an amazing rendition of the legend\'s 1984 single, ""Let\'s Go Crazy,"" while decked out just like music icon, rocking a glittery purple suit, complete with a white ascot. Mars showed just how talented he really is while covering the iconic song. Not only did he nail Prince\'s vocal range, he shredded on the guitar in a performance that blew most other Prince tributes out of the water.\n\n\n\nPHOTOS: 2017 GRAMMY Winners -- See the Stars With Their Awards!\n\n\n\n\n\nBEST MOMENT OF THE NIGHT\n\n\n\n\n\nAdele Wins Album of the Year, Tries to Give It to Beyonce\n\n\n\nTo say Adele had a big night would be a laughable understatement. She opened the show, she performed the tribute to George Michael and she became the only artist to win Song of the Year, Record of the Year and Album of the year at the same show, twice!\n\nHer tearful acceptance speech for Album of the Year was a non-stop highlight reel. For example, she seemingly confirmed that she had indeed tied the knot with her longtime boyfriend while opening up about being a mom, when she referred to Simon Konecki as her ""husband."" However, her best moment might have come when she openly wept and said that, while she appreciated the honor, she felt wrong winning it over Beyonce.\n\n""I can\'t possibly accept this award. I\'m very humbled and very grateful and gracious but [the] artist of my life is Beyonce,"" Adele said through tears as Beyonce looked up at her from the audience. ""The Lemonade album is just so monumental and so well thought out and so beautiful. We all got to see another side to you that you don\'t always let us see and we appreciate that. All us artists here appreciate you.""\n\n""I love you,"" Adele said. ""I always have and I always will.""\n\n\n\nWATCH: Adele Apologizes for Dropping F-Bomb During George Michael Tribute at the GRAMMYs\n\n\n\n\n\nWORST MOMENTS\n\n\n\n\n\nMetallica and Lady Gaga\n\n\n\nLady Gaga got in touch with her heavy metal side during a performance with Metallica and the results were\xe2\x80\xa6 awkward. From out-of-place crowd surfing to lead singer James Hetfield\'s mic getting accidentally turned off, the whole thing just fell apart on its feet in slow motion.\n\n\n\nAdele Makes Herself Cry\n\n\n\nWe never like to see Adele sad! While she might have been flawless in her opening number, when it came time to sing a tribute to the late George Michael, she had a bit of a vocal mishap that led to her getting very emotional.\n\nWhile performing Michael\'s 1996 song, ""Fastlove,"" a clearly upset Adele stopped the song and said, ""I know it\'s live TV. I f**ked up. I can\'t do it again like last year. I\'m sorry for swearing. Can we please start it again? I\'m sorry, I can\'t mess this up for him."" After the second time around, the singer appeared to be on the verge of tears, despite a stirring performance and a lot of support from the audience.\n\n\n\nGreg Kurstin Gets Cut Off\n\n\n\nMusical artists often have to contend with the ""wrap it up"" music when their acceptance speeches go long, but rarely do you see their mics cut off entirely. When Adele and producer Greg Kurstin won the GRAMMY for Song of the Year, Adele got to thank fans, but when Kurstin took the mic, the show producers could not care less and cut away without letting him talk at all. The move elicited a chorus of boos from the audience and was yet another tech hiccup. Luckily, Adele ended up correcting the show\'s mistake by letting Kurstin talk first when they won Record of the Year.\n\n\n\nJames Corden Trolls Fans Over Kanye West\'s Boycott\n\n\n\nKanye West was very adamant about not showing up to the GRAMMYs this year. So, when Corden came out to seemingly introduce a performance by the Life of Pablo artist, a lot of fans and viewers freaked out! Then, it turned out Corden was trolling us entirely and the whole thing was just a set-up to the invariably dry annual speech by Recording Academy President Neil Portnow. It was a letdown, to say the least.\n\n\n\nNEWS: Chance the Rapper Was Everyone\'s Best Friend at the 2017 GRAMMYs -- See the Pics!\n\n\n\n\n\nWEIRDEST MOMENTS\n\n\n\n\n\nJames Corden\'s Disastrous Intro\n\n\n\nIn what was supposed to be a joke mocking the recent spate of tech problems at various awards shows, Corden\'s introduction was filled with (intentionally) broken lifts, pratfalls and various mishaps. While it was very funny at the time, it turned out to be a good predictor of the multitude of technical issues that plagued the rest of the show.\n\n\n\nEverything With John Travolta\n\n\n\nThe Saturday Night Fever star came out to promote the fact that there was going to be a Bee Gees tribute later in the show.

"b'American lawyer, judge, television personality, television producer, and author\n\nJudith Susan Sheindlin (n\xc3\xa9e Blum; born October 21, 1942),[2] known professionally as Judge Judy, is an American prosecution lawyer, former Manhattan family court judge, television personality, television producer, and author. Since September 1996, Sheindlin has presided over her own successful four-time Daytime Emmy Award\xe2\x80\x93winning arbitration-based court show series, Judge Judy.[2] Sheindlin will conclude her popular program after its 25th season (2020/21), then launch Judy Justice, a similar series.[3]\n\nSheindlin passed the New York state bar examination in 1965 and became a prosecutor in the family court system. In 1982 New York City Mayor Ed Koch appointed her as a judge, first in criminal court, then later as Manhattan\'s supervising family court judge in 1986.\n\nSheindlin is the longest-serving judge or arbiter in courtroom-themed programming history, a distinction that earned Sheindlin a place in the Guinness World Records in 2015.[4] She has additionally received a Lifetime Achievement Emmy in 2019 for her work; during the awards ceremony, comedian Amy Poehler referred to Sheindlin as ""the Jewish mother we all want"".[5]\n\nEarly life [ edit ]\n\nSheindlin was born Judith Susan Blum in the Brooklyn borough of New York City, to a Jewish family, from Germany, Russia, and Ukraine.[6][7][2][8] She described her father as ""the greatest thing since sliced bread"" and her mother as ""a meat and potatoes kind of gal.""[9]\n\nSheindlin attended James Madison High School in Brooklyn before going on to American University in Washington, D.C., where she graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree, majoring in government. She finished her law school education at New York Law School, where she earned her Juris Doctor degree in 1965.[10]\n\nCareer [ edit ]\n\nSheindlin passed the New York state bar examination in 1965, the same year as her graduation, and was hired as a corporate lawyer for a cosmetics firm.[2] Within two years she became dissatisfied with her job and left to raise her two children. She was made aware of a position in the New York court system as a prosecutor in the family courts in 1972.[2] In her role as a lawyer, Sheindlin prosecuted child abuse cases, domestic violence and juvenile crime.[2]\n\nBy 1982, Sheindlin\'s ""no-nonsense"" attitude inspired New York Mayor Ed Koch to appoint her as a criminal court judge.[2] Four years later, she was promoted to supervising judge in the family court\'s Manhattan division.[2] She earned a reputation as a ""tough"" judge (though she has disagreed with the labels ""tough"" and ""harsh""),[11] known for her quick decision-making.[9]\n\nIn February 1993, Sheindlin\'s reputation made her the subject of a Los Angeles Times article,[12] profiling her as a woman determined to make the court system work for the common good.[2] She subsequently was featured in a segment on CBS\'s 60 Minutes that brought her national recognition.[2] This led to her first book, Don\'t Pee on My Leg and Tell Me It\'s Raining, published in 1996. She retired as a family court judge that same year after having heard more than 20,000 cases.[2]\n\nJudge Judy [ edit ]\n\nJudge Judy stands next to a portrait of herself (2005)\n\nAfter the 60 Minutes special on her family court career in 1993 and authoring her first book shortly thereafter (Don\'t Pee on My Leg and Tell Me It\'s Raining), Sheindlin was approached about starring in a new reality courtroom series, featuring ""real cases with real rulings.""[10] She accepted the offer, and her ongoing syndicated court show, Judge Judy, debuted on September 16, 1996.[13] The court show\'s present 24th season commenced on September 9, 2019.\n\nSince its debut, Judge Judy has remained the No. 1 rated court show[14] and regularly draws approximately 9 to 10 million viewers daily.[15] During the 2009\xe2\x80\x9310 television season, Judge Judy became the first TV series in nearly a decade to attract more daytime viewers than The Oprah Winfrey Show.[16] Since then, it has been the highest rated show in all of daytime television.[17]\n\nOn March 2, 2015, CBS Television Distribution and Judge Sheindlin announced a contract extension through the 2020/21 season.[18] Sheindlin revealed in a March 2020 appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show that the series would conclude after its 25th anniversary.[19]\n\nAuthor Brendan I. Koerner has commented on the popularity of Judge Judy:\n\nCourt-show viewers don\'t seem to want moral conundrums or technical wrinkles. They love Sheindlin\'s show because she offers them a fantasy of how they\'d like the justice system to operate\xe2\x80\x94swiftly, and without procedural mishaps or uppity lawyers. They get to see wrongdoers publicly humiliated by a strong authority figure. There is no uncertainty after Sheindlin renders her verdict and bounds off the bench, and there certainly are no lengthy appeals.[20]\n\nA 2013 Reader\'s Digest poll supported Koerner\'s statements, revealing that Americans trusted Judge Judy more than all nine justices of the United States Supreme Court.[21]\n\nThe program has integrated itself into American popular culture.[10] In 2003, VH1 named Sheindlin one of the ""200 Greatest Pop Culture Icons.""[22] References to Sheindlin\xe2\x80\x94typically as ""Judge Judy"", though often satirical\xe2\x80\x94have appeared in multitudes of television programs and other media, including ABC\'s Jimmy Kimmel Live!;[21] Fox\'s The Simpsons as Judge Constance Harm (voiced by Jane Kaczmarek); NBC\'s Will & Grace; UPN/The CW\'s America\'s Next Top Model; NBC\'s The Weakest Link; ABC\'s The Practice; the Academy Awards; the book America: A Citizen\'s Guide to Democracy Inaction by Jon Stewart;[10] a skit by Vicki Lawrence portraying Thelma Harper/Mama on ""Betty White\'s 2nd Annual 90th Birthday"" celebration,[23] drag queen Bianca Del Rio portraying Judge Judy on RuPaul\'s Drag Race, etc.\n\nSheindlin has been parodied on Saturday Night Live, The Simpsons as Judge Constance Harm, and The Amanda Show as Judge Trudy.\n\nThe Judge Judy courtroom series has earned Sheindlin numerous awards and honors, including a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in February 2006;[24] induction into Broadcasting & Cable\'s Hall of Fame in October 2012;[25][26] being awarded vice presidency of the UCD Law Society in April 2013;[27] being presented with the Gracie Allen Tribute Award from the Alliance for Women in Media;[22] being awarded the Mary Pickford Award by the Hollywood Chamber Community Foundation at the 2014 Heroes of Hollywood;[28] etc.\n\nOne award Sheindlin had difficulty winning was a Daytime Emmy Award. By 2011, her program had been nominated 14 consecutive years without winning.[29][30] In mid-2012, an article from the New York Post reported that Judge Judy was snubbed by the award show by not even being nominated that year despite being the highest-rated court show.[31] In an interview with Entertainment Tonight (ET) on May 3, 2013, Sheindlin said, ""I have my walls full of Daytime Emmy Award nominations."" When ET\'s interviewer asked Sheindlin if she thought she would ever win the award, she replied:\n\nI don\'t know. You know, somehow it would sort of break the spell. The show has been such a tremendous success that I\'m almost afraid to think about winning\xe2\x80\x94because so many of those shows that did win are no longer with us. So I say to myself \'you want the Emmy or you want a job? (laughing) Which one do you want?\'[32]\n\nOn June 14, 2013, Judge Judy won its first Daytime Emmy for Outstanding Legal/Courtroom Program, having received its 15th nomination.[33] The program won again in 2016 and 2017. Sheindlin\'s status as longest-serving judge or arbiter in courtroom-themed programming history rewarded her a place in the Guinness World Records on September 14, 2015, as part of her court show\'s 20th-anniversary celebration.[34]\n\nLongevity and retirement plans [ edit ]\n\nThe only court shows that outnumber Judge Judy\'s seasons are The People\'s Court (on which Judy\'s husband Judge Jerry Sheindlin was a judge from 1999-2001) and Divorce Court\xe2\x80\x94both of which have suffered cancellation(s) and gone through multiple judges or arbitrators.\n\nOn March 30, 2011, Sheindlin was admitted to the hospital after she fainted on the set of her show while handling a case. She was released the next day, and it was later learned that she suffered a mini-stroke.[35] Regarding her retirement, Sheindlin has stated that it is up to her viewers and when they tire of watching the program, which she believes will inevitably happen one day. As of the present, however, Sheindlin has stated that fans still seem to be interested and taking something out of the court show.[36] Sheindlin admits the court show is ""seductive"" and hard to give up. Sheindlin said, ""I\'m not tired. I still feel engaged by what I do, and I still have people who like to watch it.""[14]\n\nSheindlin announced the 2020/21 season of Judge Judy would be the last, after 25 years. Her new series Judy Justice will follow a similar format.[37]\n\nSalary [ edit ]\n\nIn 2005, Sheindlin\'s salary was US$15 million per year.[20] Her net worth at the beginning of 2007 was $95 million, and she ranked #13 on the Forbes top 20 richest women in entertainment.[38] In July 2010 when Sheindlin\'s contract was renewed, her salary increased to $45 million per year. It was later reported in October 2013 that Sheindlin is the highest-paid TV star, earning $47 million per year for Judge Judy, which translates into just over $900,000 per workday (she works 52 days per year).[39] According to Forbes, Sheindlin earned $147 million, pretax, in 2017.[40]\n\nOther media appearances [ edit ]\n\nSince the success of Sheindlin\'s courtroom series, she has been interviewed on talk and cable news broadcasts over the course of her career. These talk and cable news programs include Entertainment Tonight, The Wendy Williams Show,[41] Katie (numerous appearances),[42] Larry King Live (numerous appearances),[43] The View (numerous appearances),[44] Donny & Marie,[45] The Talk,[46] The Tonight Show, Dateline NBC, 20/20, etc.[47] On October 17, 1998, Sheindlin made a surprise guest appearance on Saturday Night Live, comedically interrupting one of Cheri Oteri\'s regular parodies of her presiding on Judge Judy.[48] Also as a result of her Judge Judy show stardom, she served as a judge for the 1999 Miss America pageant.[41]\n\nEarly on in her celebrity on February 21, 2000, the Biography program aired a documentary film on Sheindlin, ""Judge Judy: Sitting in Judgment"" (later released on home video). This 60-minute documentary captured Sheindlin\'s entire life story (dating back to her childhood), legal career, authoring career, entertainment career, etc. The special also featured input from those closest to Sheindlin and those who knew her best.[49][50] On December 23, 2008, Sheindlin shared about her life on Shatner\'s Raw Nerve, in which she was interviewed by William Shatner.[51] A year later in December 2009, Sheindlin again told the story of her life, legal career, authoring career, and entertainment courtroom career from an updated perspective in a two-hour interview for Archive of American Television.[52] In a free-wheeling 60-minute interview conducted by Katie Couric on September 17, 2013, for the 92nd Street Y, Sheindlin elaborated on previously-undisclosed fun facts of her life story and long career in the family court.[53][54]\n\nAs confirmed in January 2014, a new court show conceived by Sheindlin titled Hot Bench debuted on September 15, 2014. The courtroom series features a panel of three judges debating and deciding on cases brought to their TV courtroom. Stated Sheindlin, ""When my husband Jerry and I were in Ireland recently, we visited the courts and watched a three-judge bench, which I found both fascinating and compelling. I immediately thought what a terrific and unique idea for a television program that brings the court genre to the next level. We have assembled three individuals with extremely varied backgrounds to serve as the judges. They are smart and talented, with terrific instincts and great chemistry, and are sure to create a hot bench."" The panel of judges consists of New York State Supreme Court judge Patricia DiMango and Los Angeles attorneys Tanya Acker and Larry Bakman (Bakman has since been replaced on Hot Bench by Michael Corriero). As with Judge Judy, Hot Bench is executive-produced by Randy Douthit and produced by CBS Television Distribution.[55][56] Sheindlin originally desired the title of her personal courtroom series to be Hot Bench before producers ultimately settled on Judge Judy.[57][58][59]\n\nOn August 31, 2016, it was reported that CBS has a scripted, semi-autobiographical drama series in the works based on the life of Sheindlin. The program title will be Her Honor (which was a proposed title for Sheindlin\'s court show along with Hot Bench). The show has been described as following the youngest judge in New York who, while proficient at handling family court cases, has a personal life that needs work. Executive producers of the program include Sheindlin herself, Chernuchin, Arnold Kopelson and Anne Kopelson. Chernuchin was a writer for the legal drama series Law & Order.[60][61][62]\n\nIn 2017, Sheindlin created a game show called IWitness that debuted on July 10 and ran for 6 weeks. The game show puts the contestant\'s observational skills to the test, requiring them to view video clips and recall what they have witnessed faster than their competitors.[63] On September 17, 2017, Sheindlin appeared on the series premiere of Fox News Channel\'s Objectified hosted by Harvey Levin. The program\'s first episode took an inside look at Sheindlin\'s life.[64]\n\nThe National Enquirer issued a formal apology in the September 2017 edition of their magazine for false statements, defaming Sheindlin as having cheated on her husband and suffering from Alzheimer\'s Disease along with brain damage. In addition, they apologized to her daughter Nicole Sheindlin for defaming her as having a jail record.[65]\n\nSheindlin and her program appeared on a November 26, 2017 broadcast of Curb Your Enthusiasm, presiding over a sketch comedy court case with Larry David as the plaintiff. The pseudo-Judge Judy case took the appearance of an actual case from Sheindlin\'s program, taking place from the show\'s courtroom set with trademarked voice-over briefs, theme music and audience response.[66]\n\nIn 2018 Sheindlin appeared as a guest on Norm Macdonald Has a Show on Netflix.[67]\n\nWriting [ edit ]\n\nSheindlin has authored seven books. In 1995, Judge Sheindlin published her first book, Don\'t Pee On My Leg and Tell Me It\'s Raining, in which she offers her insight into how and why the family court fails in its mission to impact shattered families. Beauty Fades, Dumb Is Forever, her second book, was published in January 1999. Her first children\'s book entitled, Win or Lose By How You Choose was published in 2000, followed by You Can\'t Judge A Book By Its Cover the next year. Sheindlin\'s third book for adults, Keep It Simple, Stupid: You\'re Smarter Than You Look, also on the New York Times best seller list, published in 2000, shares her wisdom and opinions on solving family issues.[68] One of her more recent books, which hit shelves on April 25, 2013, was inspired by one of her advisory catch phrases encouraging romantic partners to be judicious with regard to domestic partnerships.[69] In September 2014, Sheindlin celebrated the opening of her 19th season by giving out her latest book, What Would Judy Say: Be the Hero of Your Own Story, for free.[citation needed]\n\nNon-media projects and community work [ edit ]\n\nSheindlin, along with her stepdaughter Nicole Sheindlin, is the creator, director, and spokesperson for an alliance designed to empower women, entitled ""Her Honor Mentoring"".[70][71]\n\nIn September 2017, Sheindlin funded a space for public debate at the University of Southern California.[72]\n\nPersonal life [ edit ]\n\nIn 1964, Judy married Ronald Levy, who later became a prosecutor in juvenile court. They moved to New York and had two children, Jamie and Adam,[2] and divorced in 1976 after 12 years of marriage.[2]\n\nIn 1977, she married Judge Jerry Sheindlin, who was an arbitrator on The People\'s Court from 1999 to 2001.[2] They divorced in 1990, partially as a result of the stress and struggles that Judy endured after her father\'s death that same year.[2] They remarried a year later. She has three stepchildren with Sheindlin: Gregory, Jonathan and Nicole, and 13 grandchildren.[2] Jonathan is a retinal surgeon,[73] and Greg and Nicole are lawyers. Nicole is the co-creator (along with her stepmother) of the Her Honor Mentoring program.\n\nSheindlin owns homes in several states, including Connecticut,[74] New York,[75] Florida,[76] and Wyoming.[77] She commuted to Los Angeles every other week for two to four days to tape episodes of Judge Judy.[14][75] However, in May 2013, she bought a $10.7 million condominium in the Los Angeles suburb of Beverly Hills.[78] In 2018, Judy and her husband announced spending $9 million on the Bird House, a 9,700-square-foot property on 3.67 acres in Newport, Rhode Island that was owned by Dorrance Hill Hamilton.[79]\n\nSheindlin holds honorary Doctor of Law degrees from Elizabethtown College and the University at Albany, SUNY.[68]\n\nSheindlin is a registered Independent.[80] She is a supporter of same-sex marriage and,[44] although she has said that she is not a supporter of ""big government"", she believes that the issue of same-sex marriage should be handled at the federal level rather than on a state-by-state basis.[81] Sheindlin has stated that she is in favor of increasing requirements for gun ownership.[82] She prefers not to be labelled by political terms, and states that she is not registered with any political party. When asked about the 2012 presidential elections, Sheindlin stated that while she voted for President Barack Obama in 2008 (as well as voting for Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton, respectively in 1980 and 1984, and 1992 and 1996), she did not care for either of the leading candidates in the 2012 United States presidential election.[83] In October 2019 Sheindlin penned an op-ed endorsing Michael Bloomberg for president, despite the fact that he had not announced a campaign.[84][85] In January 2020 she released an ad supporting him saying, in part, ""I like to say you can judge someone\'s character by what they\'ve done; Mike Bloomberg has done amazing things, and will be a truly great president"".[85][86] She later campaigned alongside him.[87]\n\nLegal issues [ edit ]\n\nIn March 2013, a lawsuit was filed against Sheindlin by Patrice Jones, the estranged wife of Randy Douthit, executive producer of the Judge Judy court show. Jones alleged Douthit and Sheindlin had conspired to permit Sheindlin to buy Christofle fine china and Marley cutlery owned by Jones. She said Sheindlin had paid Douthit $50,815 for the items without her knowledge to deprive her of her valuables,[88] and she sought $514,421 from Sheindlin. The suit was settled out of court after Sheindlin returned the tableware to Douthit, and Jones agreed to pay him $12,500 and have the tableware handed back to her.[89]\n\nOn March 12, 2014, Sheindlin filed a lawsuit for the first time in her life. It was filed against Hartford, Connecticut personal injury lawyer John Haymond and his law firm. In the lawsuit, Sheindlin accused Haymond and his firm of using her television image without consent in advertisements that falsely suggested she endorsed him and his firm. Sheindlin\'s producer allegedly told the firm that use of her image is not permitted in March 2013, but ads continued to be produced. The lawsuit filed in federal court sought more than $75,000 in damages. Sheindlin said in her statement that any money she wins through the lawsuit will go toward college scholarships through the Her Honor Mentoring program. Sheindlin further stated, ""Mr. Haymond is a lawyer and should know better. The unauthorized use of my name is outrageous and requires legal action.""[90][91][92] Haymond later filed a countersuit for punitive damages and attorney\'s fees, alleging defamation of him and his firm by Sheindlin.[93] Haymond insisted that local affiliates asked him to appear in Judge Judy promos to promote Sheindlin for which he obliged.[94][95] On August 8, 2014, it was reported that the case between Sheindlin and Haymond settled out of court in a resolution that favored Sheindlin. Haymond will be donating money to Sheindlin\'s charity, Her Honor Mentoring.[96]\n\nWorks [ edit ]\n\nFurther reading [ edit ]'"

"b'Update (September 21, 2:50 P.M.): A source close to the couple tells VF.com that the report they are married is false.\n\nThe original post continues below.\n\nWhen one celebrity marriage ends, another begins (that\xe2\x80\x99s how that saying goes, right?). Fresh off the news that Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are getting divorced\xe2\x80\x94which you might have heard; it was written up in a few periodicals yesterday and will possibly be covered today as well\xe2\x80\x94Us Weekly is reporting that notoriously private couple Ryan Gosling and Eva Mendes are married. Not only did they allegedly tie the knot, they may have done so earlier this year. They\xe2\x80\x99re newlyweds, and have been for quite some time.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMultiple sources reveal in the new issue of Us Weekly\xe2\x80\x9d that Gosling and \xe2\x80\x9chis love of five years, Eva Mendes, quietly tied the knot earlier this year among a small group of family and friends.\xe2\x80\x9d Another source goes on to say that, \xe2\x80\x9cEva and Ryan have always felt like a married couple. . . . They are infatuated with each other.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnonymous sources live for getting Shakespearean-sonnet levels of romantic when describing two people\xe2\x80\x99s love for one another.

"b'Entertainment The 13 Most Tear-Jerking \'This Is Us\' Moments, Ranked\n\nNBC\n\nThis Is Us wrapped up its powerful sophomore season with Kate and Toby\'s wedding, which, if you know the show, meant a tear-fueled, emotional gut punch of an episode that we\'re still reeling from. The show has a reputation for making fans bawl like babies, and it might even feel manipulative if it wasn\'t so downright moving. The themes of family, of love, of the magical ways we transcend life and death, melt together to create something singular and special; a show that isn\'t interested in awe and spectacle, but in life\'s casual beauty and brutality. To celebrate the second season finale, we decided to rank the most tear-inducing moments in This Is Us history. Whether happy or sad, these are the moments that keep us tuning in -- with hanky in hand. (Beware of spoilers if you\'re not all caught up!)\n\n13. Dr. K comforts Rebecca ""The Car,"" Season 2, Episode 15 A fair warning up front: the death of This Is Us patriarch Jack Pearson (Milo Ventimiglia) factors into several spots on this list. How could it not? His death is the driving force of the series, informing every present-day storyline as his children and wife continue to deal with their grief and revel in the splendor of his life. This moment, from one of the most quietly devastating episodes of television ever, is something of an accessory to other entries on the list, or else it would rank higher. Dr. Katowski, the obstetrician who delivered the triplets and became a father figure to Jack, surprises Rebecca at Jack\'s wake, and motivates her to press on. ""You are the same woman who lost a child and rolled out of my hospital with three babies just the same,"" Dr. K wisely intones. ""You\'re as tough as they come, Rebecca Pearson.""\n\n12. Jack tells Kate he has a drinking problem ""A Manny-Splendored Evening,"" Season 2, Episode 2 Jack\'s relationship with his daughter is one of the loveliest gifts This Is Us has given us. His utter acceptance and love of the insecure Kate is why her modern-day incarnation is so broken: she lost the one person who could always lift her up. This moment in Season 2 is the pair at their most honest. Jack confesses to Kate that he\'s an alcoholic, and Kate, though devastated, places her hands on her father\'s cheeks -- an affectionate gesture Jack uses on his kids in their moments of distress. The role-reversal is significant, and shows how much Kate has grown through and because of her doting dad.\n\n11. Rebecca talks to her unborn babies ""The Big Day,"" Season 1, Episode 12 From the show\'s beginning, Rebecca has been hard to decode. Some of that is by design; in the second episode of the series, we see that in the present-day she is married to Jack\'s best friend. This is before we knew Jack was dead, and before we knew the circumstance surrounding that event. Because of the mystery, Rebecca felt somewhat inaccessible. All we really knew was that she came from a strict family and that she didn\'t want kids until Jack persuaded her. That\'s why this moment is so touching. A very-pregnant Rebecca, just hours from delivery, talks to the triplets in her womb. ""I love you so much it hurts and I haven\'t even met you yet,"" she says through tears. We know that one of those triplets is a stillborn, which tinges her words with an extra melancholy.\n\n10. Kate and Toby get married ""The Wedding,"" Season 2, Episode 18 We always knew Kate and Toby\'s wedding would be emotional. Kate, the ultimate daddy\'s girl, has to walk down the aisle without her father, his absence an un-ignorable anecdote to what should be the happiest day of her life. But This Is Us found a way to place him there anyway. ""One day, a long time from now, you\'re gonna meet someone who is better than me,"" Jack tells his young daughter in a flashback, which is played over the moment her brothers walk her down the aisle in his place. It\'s all lovely and beautiful, until the gut-punch comes. ""Your mom and I, we\'re gonna be there,"" he continues. ""I\'ll get to walk you down the aisle, and I may even cry a little."" No Jack, we\'re the ones crying.\n\n9. Beth mourns William ""What Now?"" Season 1, Episode 17 Beth is a This Is Us secret weapon. Funny, acerbic, but strong and loving, she\'s the perfect match for the anxiety-ridden Randall. Their marriage is the soulmate story of the present timeline -- easygoing, familial, fool-proof. That\'s why her breakdown over the death of Randall\'s birth father, William, is so hard to watch. Beth is rarely as vulnerable as she is here, where she recalls their brief time together, and how she never expected to love him so much. She\'s also angry that he didn\'t leave her anything behind, like he did for everyone else. By episode\'s end, we see that\'s not the case; William mailed her a postcard from Memphis just before he passed on. Still, the layers of Beth\'s grief -- expressed at his ""fun-eral,"" a celebration of life instead of death that his granddaughters plan -- are so palpable here. It\'s nice to see her softer side.\n\n8. Kate lets it all out ""Three Sentences,"" Season 1, Episode 13 Kate\'s weight struggles are a big part of her storyline, and, as we learn, an expression of her grief after Jack\'s death. As she admits to Toby, her father\'s death spawned a period of self-hate; she stopped taking care of herself, mentally and physically. She eventually attends a New Age weight loss camp in upstate New York to quell her demons, and though she\'s indifferent to the experience at first -- she was expecting boot camp, and got self-care yoga seminars instead -- she eventually settles into the groove. In this moment, during an immersive course that includes beating drumsticks and emoting, Kate is able to connect with her grief. As she pounds out the sticks, she flashes to Jack\'s funeral, seeing in color the hurt that she\'s buried. It\'s a beautiful moment of self-realization, and bursts open the damn of self-acceptance Kate so desperately needs.\n\n7. Rebecca sees Jack\'s body ""Super Bowl Sunday,"" Season 2, Episode 14 This episode was the ""big one."" The one where Jack dies. And it aired on Super Bowl Sunday with a heavy dose of pre-promotion. Audiences tuned in to finally see what happened that fateful day, and oh boy, was it a doozy. The Pearson house catches fire thanks to a faulty Crock-Pot and a poorly placed towel. Jack discovers the flames in the knick of time and is able to get his family out, but he goes back inside for Kate\'s dog and some of the family\'s mementos. This proves a fatal decision: Jack is taken to the hospital for a routine examination, but suffers a fatal ""widow maker"" heart attack from smoke inhalation. Rebecca is in the lobby when it happens, getting snacks out of a vending machine. The doctor comes to tell her that her husband is dead, and she responds with denial. ""Are you out of your mind?"" she asks, then bolts to Jack\'s room to tell him about their crazy doctor. Instead, she finds his lifeless body. Mandy Moore does career-defining work in this scene. Her face goes through every stage of grief in a flash as she accepts the reality of her husband\'s death. It\'s made all the more haunting in that we don\'t see Jack\'s body for ourselves, only the hint of it in a hospital window reflection.\n\n6. Jack tells Randall it\'s OK to be different ""Career Days,"" Season 1, Episode 6 Randall isn\'t like the other Pearson kids. He\'s adopted, black, and, it turns out, a genius. As if the first two things aren\'t hard enough, his intelligence only further others him as a child, when report card As are rewarded with ice cream cones and parental affection. Randall doesn\'t want to be treated any differently than he already is, and so he lies to his dad about his mathematical abilities. But Jack knows, and puts his son to the test, under the guise of helping him with work. When Randall resists, Jack asks why, and his son lets it be known how ostracized he feels. Jack processes this, before telling Randall that it\'s OK to be different, and that he is as much his son as his other children are. ""I love you as much as a human heart can, kiddo,"" Jack goes on, cementing his status as the world\'s best dad. ""You are an exceptional young man."" Future Randall becomes a millionaire weather trader; we see the seeds of that success planted by his father\'s words.\n\n5. Kevin runs to Randall ""Jack Pearson\'s Son,"" Season 1, Episode 15 ""What would Jack Pearson do?"" It\'s a question the eldest Pearson child, Kevin, asks himself. Kevin is a failed actor making a go of it on Broadway after stepping away from a humiliating and dehumanizing sitcom role. He needs to be taken seriously -- and for the play to be a success -- to resurrect his career. But on opening night, the specter of his father haunts him. Kevin knows that Randall, prone to panic attacks, is having a breakdown across town. And so, moments before curtain call, Kevin flees the play and runs to his brother, with whom he\'s always had a contentious relationship. In one of his first truly selfless moments, Kevin does exactly what his father would have done: he puts family over ego. It\'s just what Randall needs, and, in a way, it\'s just what Kevin needs, too.\n\n4. ""Something resembling lemonade."" ""Pilot,"" Season 1, Episode 1 Dr. K was there for some of the most salient moments in the Pearson family\'s lives. The first big one was the delivery of the triplets. Rather, the twins; the third child was stillborn. Dr. K delivers this news to Jack in the hallway of the hospital, while Rebecca recovers in a nearby room. Jack is understandably shaken, and the doctor lets him has his moment. But then he consoles him with a speech that serves as something of a tagline for the series: ""I like to think that maybe one day you\'ll be an old man like me, talking a younger man\'s ear off, explaining to him how you took the sourest lemon that life has to offer and turned it into something resembling lemonade."" It\'s a phrase Jack passed on to his children, an oft-repeated passage in Pearson family lore. This scene also launched the pilot into its twist ending, when we realize the children Dr. K delivered -- and the baby Jack and Rebecca adopt -- grow up to be the adults we\'re following in the present.\n\n3. Kevin breaks down on the football field ""Number One,"" Season 2, Episode 8 Kevin is the most misunderstood Pearson child, a pretty boy actor with a self-destructive streak, he\'s the most damaged by Jack\'s death. He was the only Pearson absent from the fire, and that guilt haunts him, manifesting in the same addiction his father struggled with. At his lowest moment, he travels home to Pittsburgh to attend an event celebrating his achievements at his old high school. The trip is a painful one for Kevin, who drowns out his pain with alcohol and painkillers. The episode\'s most tragic moment comes as Kevin visits the football field where he suffered a career-killing injury. He guzzles wine and says his failures aloud, sports-announcer style. ""Kevin Pearson will walk again, just in time to bury his beloved father,"" he says through tears. This is Kevin at his most raw and miserable, our first real insight into the baggage he carries around unprocessed.\n\n\n\n2. William\'s death ""Memphis,"" Season 1, Episode 16 William was such a great break-from-the-mold type of character. A former drug addict who left his newborn son on the steps of a fire station, he was totally reformed by the time Randall found him. His story was tragic, but William was never disappointing. He didn\'t relapse, he didn\'t steal or make his presence in the Pearson household uncomfortable. He defied our pre-conceived expectations by being a wholly good person. That\'s why losing him was so hard. We knew it was coming; from the pilot, we knew William had terminal cancer. His life had a timestamp. Luckily, he went at the perfect moment, after road-tripping to his hometown of Memphis with the son he barely got to know -- but still knew well enough. There\'s also a wordless connection of father figures here; William uses the breathing trick Jack taught him for his anxiety to calm his birth father as he passes on, bridging a family divide through a gentle act of love.\n\n1. ""We\'re gonna be OK."" ""The Car,"" Season 2, Episode 15 Every moment of ""The Car"" could fit somewhere on this list, but we kept it to only two spots just to be fair. The episode cleans up the mess of Jack\'s death, allowing the audience a full-on spectacle of grief to help process our devastation. It isn\'t an easy watch. Every moment with Jack is an arrow to the heart, and every moment without him even worse. The family car is a framing device. Jack buys it to protect his family; what he doesn\'t know is how it will care for them even after he\'s gone. We see an array of family moments in the car, both happy and sad: a joyful singalong on the way to a Weird Al concert; an angry fight between brothers; Rebecca driving her kid\'s to their dad\'s funeral, trying to ignore her dead husband\'s coffee in the cup holder. The final montage of the episode ties all of those moments together, in one cathartic, tear-inducing swell of emotion. Rebecca gathers the kids at Jack\'s favorite tree after his funeral and shows her maternal strength. She insists that Kevin and Randall don\'t have to take Jack\'s spot, and that it wasn\'t Kate\'s fault her dad went back for the dog. They spread his ashes, and head off, but Rebecca lingers for a moment. ""We\'re gonna be OK, babe,"" she whispers. ""I promise you, we\'re gonna be OK."" It\'s a quiet pledge -- to Jack, to us -- that though we move on, we never lose sight of the things we\'ve loved and lost.\n\nSign up here for our daily Thrillist email and subscribe here for our YouTube channel to get your fix of the best in food/drink/fun.'"
"b'Let\'s face it. The franchise just hasn\'t been the same since fan favorite NeNe Leakes departed The Real Housewives Of Atlanta after Season 7. But alas the OG peach is returning to the reality series for Season 10 with more fierceness and shadiness than ever before. But after two seasons have come and gone without her, you may be wondering: why is NeNe coming back to RHOA now?\n\nThe explanation for her return is quite simple. NeNe says that she\'s rejoining the cast for the benefit of her loyal fans. After the network made the official announcement in June 2017 that she was returning to the hit series, NeNe took to Bravo\'s The Daily Dish in praise of what all of the RHOA love has meant to her over the years. ""I just want to be the person to finally say to my fans who have supported me for so many years... I\'m back and ready for Season 10. Let the shade begin, hunni!"" she said.\n\nFans first met the outspoken NeNe in the very first season of RHOA. With her blonde hair and dramatic personality she turned heads whenever she entered a room. From the beginning of the series she was a favorite, as she never hesitated to say exactly what was on her mind. She provided the utmost entertainment through her many witty quotes, comebacks, and side-eye before letting fans know that she sadly wouldn\'t return for season 8. Though, many fans have continued using her dramatic GIFS, memes, and one-liners in her absence. So she was gone, but not forgotten.\n\nIn 2015 she told People that leaving the show felt like a weight had ""been lifted off of [her] shoulders."" That\'s no surprise being that most of the drama and arguments centered around NeNe. But in her defense she didn\'t start all of them. Nonetheless, NeNe officially traded in her peach in 2015.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis was definitely a hard decision for me,\xe2\x80\x9d Leakes told People at the time. \xe2\x80\x9cMe and my husband [Gregg Leakes] have been going back and forth on it for weeks now. But my contract is up and I just think this is the right time. This is my opportunity to spread my wings and do different things.\xe2\x80\x9d The announcement for her departure came on the heels of news that Leakes would be focusing on other projects. She had previously guest starred on the hit FOX series Glee and NBC\'s The New Normal. Soon after leaving RHOA she made her Broadway debut as the wicked stepmother in Cinderella, alongside actress Keke Palmer.\n\nBut regardless of why she originally left the reality series, longtime RHOA viewers are super excited to see NeNe back in the group. She\'ll be reuniting with fellow Housewives Kenya Moore, Cynthia Bailey, Kandi Burruss, Shere\xc3\xa9 Whitfield, and Porsha Williams. Also returning to the show, both in a part-time capacity, are Kim Zolciak-Biermann and newcomer model-actor Eva Marcille. Kim was an original Housewife along with NeNe, but unlike Kim, NeNe will resume her place as a full-time Housewife when the series returns on Sunday, Nov. 5.\n\nNBC/Bravo\n\n""I am back and of course the haters know I\'m here,"" NeNe says in Season 10 trailer, which means Atlanta (and particularly Porsha) better watch out. In an exclusive sneak peek on Entertainment Tonight, NeNe wastes no time inserting herself back into the drama when she candidly confronts Porsha over some nasty comments and bad blood at Cynthia\'s 50th birthday party. And anyone who remembers NeNe\'s previous seasons on the show knows that she\'s not one to back down from a (verbal) fight.\n\nSo how will this crew of Southern Belles get along with NeNe back in the building? Find out when RHOA returns for Season 10.'"

"b'April (born 2002) is a reticulated giraffe at the Animal Adventure Park in Harpursville, New York, in the United States. She gained worldwide fame after a live video of her in the late stages of pregnancy, along with the subsequent birth, were put on YouTube. The birth was watched live by nearly 1.2 million viewers.\n\nLife [ edit ]\n\nApril was born in 2002 at the Catskill Game Farm in Catskill, New York. She resided at the Catskill Game Farm until it closed in October 2006, when she was relocated to Adirondack Animal Land in Broadalbin, New York.[3]\n\nAnimal Adventure Park owned by Jordan Patch acquired 13-year-old April shortly after acquiring Oliver, a much younger 3-year-old male giraffe, in 2015. Oliver and April soon mated, which resulted in her pregnancy that normally lasts 15 months.[4] It was Oliver\'s first siring and April\'s fourth pregnancy;[5] she had previously mothered three other giraffes, two males and a female named Autumn, with a male giraffe named Stretch.[2] After becoming pregnant, at Animal Adventure Park she became a ""viral sensation"" in February 2017 while being monitored by a live stream.[6][7][8][9] An estimated 1.2 million viewers watched the live feed of the giraffe giving birth on YouTube; the live feed was sponsored by Toys R Us and Babies R Us, as a play on that chain\'s mascot, Geoffrey the Giraffe.[5] By the time the camera was shut off, the YouTube feed had accumulated 232 million views.[10] A GoFundMe fundraiser page that initially set a goal of $50,000 sat at more than $135,000 by the time the calf was born. The money is to be used to offset the annual care for the animals and upgrading the giraffe exhibit at the park.[11]\n\nWith the prolonged wait for April to enter labor, some people had questioned if the pregnancy was an April Fools\' Day joke,[12][13][14] and other conspiracy theories had also been put forward.[15] Prior to the birth, April\'s veterinarian Dr Tim Slater stated that despite a great sense of anticipation, the birth of her calf was not considered overdue.[16] On April 8, 2017, April\'s zookeeper Allysa Swilley and caretaker Corey Dwyer stated that April was big, full of milk and ""closer"" to giving birth, but at this time, the calf is ""just not coming out."" A live stream of April\'s pregnancy has been posted to the video-sharing site YouTube. A minor controversy resulted when YouTube briefly removed the stream in late February 2017 following complaints from animal activists of the video allegedly violating standards in regards to nudity and sexual activity. Following thousands of complaints from YouTube users, the stream was restored to the website within an hour.[17]\n\nOn April 15, 2017, Animal Adventure Park announced April had gone into labor, noting that the calf\'s hooves had come out of the womb and that it would take between 30 minutes and two hours from that point to complete the birth. The calf, a male[5] with a height of 5.75 feet (1.75 m) and weighing 129 pounds (59 kg),[18] was born at approximately 9:54 a.m. Eastern Time.[4] The giraffe cam was shut off at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time on April 21, with the staff appearing on camera before the shutoff to express their thanks.[10] The calf was named Tajiri as a result of a name-the-baby contest, from the Swahili language word for ""hope"".[19]\n\nOn July 25, 2018, Animal Adventure Park announced that April and Oliver had conceived a second time earlier in the year.[20] This calf, also a male,[21] was born at 12:43 p.m. Eastern Time on March 16, 2019; as with Tajiri\'s birth, the birth was live-streamed on the Internet, with 300,000 viewers at the time of birth.[22] On March 16, 2019, at 12:43 pm April gave birth to her fourth son, Azizi (Ah-Zee-Zee) weighing 139 pounds with a height of 5 feet and 11 inches. The calf was on his feet at 1:27 pm; and was observed nursing at 1:51 pm.\n\nApril was placed on birth control in June 2019 and would enter senior care after her handlers observed behavior that made them believe that further calf bearing would be hazardous to her health. During her retirement, she will be housed with her two youngest children Tajiri and Azizi. Animal Adventure Park acquired another female giraffe, Johari, to continue breeding of the species with Oliver.[23]\n\nOn November 25th, 2019, it was announced that Azizi, April\'s youngest calf, will be moving to East Texas Zoo & Gator Park in Grand Saline, Texas, in spring 2020.[24] The reason being that he is growing faster than older brother Tajiri,[25] and also taking to alfalfa hay and fortified pelleted giraffe diet early on in his development.\n\nThe East Texas Zoo and Gator Park announced that Azizi the Giraffe, passed unexpectedly on Tuesday, October 27, 2020.[26] Azizi, had recently received treatment for a parasitic issue. The veterinary prescribed regimen of treatments appeared to be working, and Azizi was showing signs of improvement.

It feels like I am constantly seeing women in bikinis ripping each other\xe2\x80\x99s hair out or the housewives of America gossiping and throwing drinks in each other\xe2\x80\x99s faces.\n\nSince the early days of Hollywood, gossip about rivaling actresses has appeared on the covers of tabloids (those magazines you see in the supermarket checkout lines); however, in recent decades a new avenue for pinning women against one another has been tapped into: it\xe2\x80\x99s what we wrongly call reality television. In many of the conflicts we see between women in Hollywood, most revolve around grabbing the attention of a man.\n\nA prime example of this is ABC\xe2\x80\x99s The Bachelor. Here we have 25 scantily dressed women begging for a proposal from one man. These women are placed in a competition where the winner is most valued by her physical attractiveness to men. From the minute these women enter the door their power as individuals is taken away from them and the only thing that matters is male approval. Give me a break.\n\nIn MTV\xe2\x80\x99s reality TV show, Laguna Beach, Lauren Conrad and Heidi Montag feuded over a fellow co-star. Their dramatic rivalry and gossiping behavior became the center of the show and the source of their new celebrity. Would you want to only be known for fighting and spreading rumors? I sure wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t. Or how about reality TV shows that focus on creating drama between female friends? Producers and directors ask these women to exaggerate and gossip about one another for the sake of ratings. It\xe2\x80\x99s sickening.\n\nThere are three things that we as viewers need to realize about reality television before we decide if we should watch\n\nFirst, we need to realize that these reality shows are totally bogus and that in \xe2\x80\x9creal reality\xe2\x80\x9d people don\xe2\x80\x99t interact with one another in such hostile and dramatic ways. The fights and rivalries we see on these shows are structured. Story editors and segment producers are paid a lot of money to create drama between co-stars\n\nNext, we need to truly understand how these shows negatively represent and impact women. So let\xe2\x80\x99s say that you know that reality TV is anything but real, but you still love those juicy stories? What we need to realize is how these shows negatively affect us as women and girls. What do you think a show like The Bachelor teaches little girls to value about themselves? What do you think it is teaching boys to value about women? By supporting shows that objectify women or portray them as backstabbing villains we are approving of the inequality of women.\n\nFinally, we need to realize what we as women and girls, 51% of the American population, can do to change the industry and promote women\xe2\x80\x99s rights. By simply questioning and critically thinking about what we are watching we are taking a step towards women\xe2\x80\x99s equality. If we come together and stop watching these reality shows their ratings will falter and they will go away. Together, we have the power to make the difference we wish to see in American culture.'"

They have three kids together.\n\nMichelle McCool \xe2\x80\x93 The Undertaker Since coming onto the scene, The Undertaker has always been a wrestler who remains quiet and takes pride in his mysterious persona. This all changed when his relationship with former Diva Michelle McCool went public. It seems as though McCool has put pressure on the Phenom to share more and more photos of their holidays together in addition to nights out to sports events. In 2010, the couple tied the knot and are now parents to a daughter named Kaia Faith Calaway.\n\nWendy Jones \xe2\x80\x93 AJ Styles AJ Styles is another one of the few wrestlers on our list to marry outside of the industry, tying the knot with schoolteacher Wendy Jones in 2000. The happily married couple have four children together and Styles has each of their birth dates tattooed on his torso. Styles also ensured that each of his children would share his A.J. initials naming them Ajay, Avery, Albey and Anney. As a devout Christian, AJ has also passed along his faith to his children.\n\nDenise Hartmann \xe2\x80\x93 Christian Cage Sometimes you just have to trust that fate will sort things out. In the case of German Model Denise Hartmann, fate worked in her favor when she met WWE star Christian Cage while on vacation in England. Hartmann just happened to be in the right place at the right time and somehow spotted Cage in a crowd and its been nothing but smiles ever since. The couple tied the knot in December 2001 and have since had a daughter together named Isla.\n\nCandice LeRae \xe2\x80\x93 Johnny Gargano Let\xe2\x80\x99s face it, Johnny Gargano and Candice LeRae aren\xe2\x80\x99t the first pair of wrestlers to fall in love. AJ Lee and CM Punk immediately come to mind. They had already come a long way together before making their relationship official, with many encounters both in the ring and behind the scenes. Then, the couple made their bond eternal when they got married in 2016. Despite having lots of drama in the WWE, they are pretty stable in reality.\n\nSasha Banks \xe2\x80\x93 Sarath Ton It seems like Sasha Banks has exceeded Sarath Ton in the wrestling department. While the latter became a costume designer, the former has gone on to win the RAW Women\xe2\x80\x99s Championship. In fact, it was just a few days after they got married that she won it for the fourth time at Summerslam. Officially part of the Four Horsewomen who helped usher in the \xe2\x80\x9cDiva\xe2\x80\x99s Revolution,\xe2\x80\x9d Banks is regarded these days as one of the most talented female wrestlers in the game.\n\n\n\nStephanie Washington \xe2\x80\x93 Bret Hart There is no denying the impact that Bret \xe2\x80\x9cThe Hitman\xe2\x80\x9d Hart has had on the wrestling industry. Arguably the most well-respect wrestler to have come out of Canada, the Sharpshooter expert is best known for falling from grace, from the WWE\xe2\x80\x99s ultimate face to one of its heels as a result of a staged wrestling scandal involving Vince McMahon. He married Stephanie Washington in 2010, and although he is twice her age, Brett is hoping this is third-time lucky after two unsuccessful marriages.\n\nStephanie Miller \xe2\x80\x93 Heath Slater Alongside teammate Rhyno, Heath Slater officially became part of the first ever Smackdown! Tag Team Champions. With excellent finishing moves such as the Jumping Neckbraker and the Corkscrew Plancha in his arsenal, Slater is so unpredictable in the ring. His private life is a bit more straightforward, having married Stephanie Jean (now Miller.) Heath Slater lives a pretty conventional life with Stephanie in Fort Mill, South Carolina and since tying the knot, the couple had two daughters together.\n\nTamara McMichael -Kevin Nash The master of the powerbomb, Kevin Nash was at his WWE peak in the early 90s under the alias Deisel. It was in the WCW though where Nash truly made a name for himself. Together with Hollywood Hulk Hogan and Scott Hall (known as Razor Ramon in the WWE), the star-studded trio create the New World Order. It seems like his private life has been just as eventful, having married Tamara McMichael in 1988, separating in 2000, and then getting back together shortly after.\n\nSabine Borden \xe2\x80\x93 Sting Arguably one of the most iconic wrestlers of WCW, Sting is best known for hardly ever revealing his true self beneath that black and white face paint. After a previous marriage, Sting eventually married Sabine, shortly after Wrestlemania 31. Sabine also came out of another marriage after having two children. The personal trainer fell in love with Sting at first sight, and it seems like the couple will have plenty of time to have fun together. Sting retired in 2016.\n\nAngie Gutierrez \xe2\x80\x93 Rey Mysterio One of the ultimate luchadors in the world of wrestling, Rey Mysterio has already done so much in his WWE career. However, you can not ignore his personal life, seeing that he has been married to Angie Gutierrez since 1997. It turns out that Rey\xe2\x80\x99s real name isn\xe2\x80\x99t so Mysterio after all. Angie likes to refer to him by his birth name, Oscar. He has expressed his love for her by having many tattoos of her on his body.\n\nSonia Delbeck \xe2\x80\x93 Rob Van Dam It made sense that Rob Van Dam went for such an awesome ring name. He was born Robert Szatkowski, which doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have quite the same ring to it. Since 1998, Van Dam has been married to Sonia Delbeck, who was by his side for many years, traveling with him. This was until the couple decided to divorce after being together for 17 years. Despite citing irreconcilable differences, they have both said that they remain friends to this day.\n\nKimberly Kessler \xe2\x80\x93 Randy Orton Though Randy Orton might be one of the biggest and most recognizable names in all of wrestling, his wife, Kimberly Kessler, was merely a fan of the WWE superstar when the couple met back in 2014. As a huge fan of Orton, Kessler was absolutely smitten when he brought her to the WWE Hall Of Fame Induction. Her WWE fangirl dream came true when Orton popped the question in July 2015 and the two tied the knot in 2016.\n\nCaryl J. Peterson \xe2\x80\x93 The Iron Shiek The Iron Shiek was unique due to his unique identity. Although he was considered a heel by the fans due to his disdain for America and praise for Iran, the wrestler has remained a household name in the wrestling community since the 80s. In 1976, he married his wife, Caryl, with fellow wrestler Mean Gene Okerlund acting as his best man. His later years have been overshadowed by substance abuse, but Caryl has been by his side through thick and thin.\n\nBeth Britt \xe2\x80\x93 Jeff Hardy Best known for his antics with tables, ladders, and chairs, Jeff Hardy made a name for himself as one half the Hardy Boyz, with his brother, Matt. Master of the Swanton Bomb, Hardy has also had a pretty successful solo career. On one fateful night out in a club, he met the love of his life, Beth Britt. The pair hit it off and have been together ever since. They have had two children together, Ruby Claire and Nera Quinn Hardy.\n\nTracy James \xe2\x80\x93 Road Dogg There is no denying that Road Dogg is best known for his tag team efforts with Billy Gunn as The New Age Outlawz. These were the tag team representatives of infamous D-Generation X, which also included Sean Michaels, Triple H, X-Pac and the late Chyna. Road Dogg was something of a tag team expert, winning the title five times. He is happily married to wife Tracy, who he has had three kids with. Brian Girard James is a happy man.\n\nJess Watson \xe2\x80\x93 Xavier Woods Even since making his WWE debut 2010, Xavier Woods has been quietly making a name for himself even since moving from Total Nonstop Wrestling. After years of hard work, the wrestler is now a member of the New Day, which also consists of Kofi Kingston and Big E. The man from Georgia is still considered an up and coming wrestler, but Jess Watson gave him a new lease of life and together, they had a baby boy in 2017.\n\nJana Perry \xe2\x80\x93 Mark Henry It is quite incredible how long Mark Henry has been in the WWE. Starting off with the organization when it was still known as the WWF, Henry has been one of the heavyweights of its rings for the good part of 30 years. Sparring with the likes of Val Venus and The Undertaker, Mark Henry is still a mainstay on the roster, despite all the younger talent. He is happily married to Jana Perry and had two kids with her.\n\nMaria Kanellis \xe2\x80\x93 Mike Bennett As a highly charismatic WWE Diva, Maria Kanellis has moved on from major wrestling organizations, finding a home for herself within the independent wrestling industry. Kanellis now spends most of her time managing her husband, wrestler Mike Bennet. While Bennet may be one of the least recognizable names on our list, having never appeared on a major wrestling network, there is no telling what the future holds for the up and coming wrestler, especially with his leading lady by his side calling the shots.\n\nAbigail Rodriguez \xe2\x80\x93 Kalisto It\xe2\x80\x99s safe to say that Kalisto has become the heir apparent to Rey Mysterio\xe2\x80\x99s WWE luchador status. The high-flyer, who was born Emanuel Alejandro Rodriguez, is hellbent on not living in the shadows of his predecessor and wants to make a name for himself. Another luchador, Sin Cara, has formed a strong Tag Team partnership with Kalisto and the duo have even won the NXT Tag Team Championship. Since hitting the big time, Kalisto has tied the knot with Abigail Rodriguez.\n\nPamela Killings \xe2\x80\x93 R-Truth Many forget that Ronnie Killings, better known these days as R-Truth has had an on-and-off presence in the WWE since the Attitude era. One of his most notable achievements came when he won the Tag Team championship with Road Dogg, of all people. With other appearances in federations such as TNA, R-Truth has been something of a mainstay in the WWE since his return in 2008. In 2011, Killings married his wife Pamela and had a daughter with her in 2014.\n\nColette Christie \xe2\x80\x93 Mick Foley The man of many faces, Mick Foley has rarely just been himself during his impressive WWE career. Most of the time, he has either been Dude Love, Cactus Jack, or psychopathic mandible claw feeding Mankind. Despite fluctuating from one character to another, Foley has had to be himself more since marrying Colette Christie back in the 90s. Not only did Foley hit the jackpot with Colette, but they also had three sons and a daughter together.\n\nPaula Sopp \xe2\x80\x93 Billy Gunn The second half of the New Age Outlawz, Billy Gunn is one of the least memorable but most experienced wrestlers to have been a part of Degeneration X. Winning King of the Ring in 1999 must\xe2\x80\x99ve been his biggest wrestling achievement. This was eventually followed by true love in 2009 when Gunn married his girlfriend, Paula. Gunn\xe2\x80\x99s wife actually lifted some eyebrows when she took shots at the WWE, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cacknowledging someone after they\xe2\x80\x99ve passed away doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make up for how [bad] you were to them while they were alive!\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\n\nJennifer Hudson \xe2\x80\x93 David Otunga This is a fine example of a wrestler\xe2\x80\x99s partner who is most certainly more famous than the wrestler. Jennifer Hudson has come on in leaps and bounds since her time on American Idol. Despite having her fair share of tragedy with her family, Hudson has managed to find some luck in her love life, meeting wrestler David Otunga. Although the couple have since had a kid and even got engaged at one point, they officially separated in 2017.\n\nNikki Bella \xe2\x80\x93 John Cena John Cena got together with Total Divas star Nikki Bella in 2012. Although they\xe2\x80\x99ve dealt with some drama over the past few years, they weathered the storm and are now stronger than ever and even got engaged when Cena popped the question at WrestleMania 33.\n\nCrystal Jacobs \xe2\x80\x93 Kane It was an amazing moment when Kane burst onto the scene at WWE\xe2\x80\x99s Bad Blood event in 1997. In the first Hell in a Cell match, Glen Jacobs entered the ring, initiated the pyrotechnics and gave the tombstone piledriver to his in-ring brother, The Undertaker. Despite the black and red mask, Jacobs is actually a really nice guy and has been happily married for over two decades to Crystal Jacobs. The couple had two kids and even founded an insurance company.\n\nSable \xe2\x80\x93 Brock Lesnar As one of the original WWE Divas, Sable is an incredibly skilled wrestler in her own right. Having played a significant role during The Attitude Era, Sable decided that only a WWE superstar was worthy of her hand in marriage. She found that in Brock Lesnar, who just happens to be ten years her junior. The couple got married back in 2006 and now share two sons, Turk and Duke. Sable is now 50 years old and as stunning as ever!\n\nBess Katramados \xe2\x80\x93 Big Show The Big Show may be a 7-foot-tall modern day equivalent of Andre The Giant, but don\xe2\x80\x99t be fooled. His wife, Bess Katramados definitely wears the pants in their relationship. What she says goes and Big Show is perfectly fine with that. The larger-than-life couple got married on February 11, 2002 and now have two children together. Bess is now enjoying some much-needed family time with her husband and children in following the retirement of her main man in February 2018.\n\nKarina Steen \xe2\x80\x93 Kevin Owens On May 18, 2015, NXT champion Kevin Owens delivered a Powerbomb that shook the wrestling world, slamming the legendary John Cena into the canvas like a rag doll. As Cena lied lifeless on the mat, Owens stomped on the WWE superstar\xe2\x80\x99s belt, delivering the message that he\xe2\x80\x99s not going anywhere. While this was definitely a defining moment in the career of Owens, it hails in comparison to the day he met his beautiful wife, Karina Steen, with whom he now shares two children.\n\nNattie Neidhart \xe2\x80\x93 Tyson Kidd Nattie Neidhart and Tyson Kiss have had their fair share of drama since getting together way back in 2001. Nattie \xe2\x80\x9cNatalya\xe2\x80\x9d Neidhart made her mark on the reality show, Total Divas, by providing the show with endless juicy material due to her turbulent personal life. While their relationship certainly hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been a walk in the park, Neidhart and Kidd have always been there for each other, proving that, with a bit of work, true love can withstand anything and everything.\n\nBeth Phoenix \xe2\x80\x93 Edge Former WWE Diva Beth Phoenix started dating Adam Copeland, aka Edge, in December 2013. The incredibly strong and beautiful Phoenix was one of the most popular and well-known female wrestlers when she was in her prime, winning a WWE Divas Championship, three WWE Women\xe2\x80\x99s Championships, and becoming the youngest person to ever be inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame. Since starting their romance, Phoenix and Edge have had two daughters together and married in 2016, on Edge\xe2\x80\x99s 43rd birthday.\n\n'"

Other main characters include Nate Archibald (Chace Crawford), Chuck Bass (Ed Westwick), Jenny Humphrey (Taylor Momsen), Vanessa Abrams (Jessica Szohr), Rufus Humphrey (Matthew Settle) and Ivy Dickens (Kaylee DeFer).\n\nThe success of Gossip Girl led to many adaptations outside the United States. The show received numerous award nominations and won 18 Teen Choice Awards. The CW officially renewed Gossip Girl for a sixth and final season on May 11, 2012.[1] The final season, consisting of 10 episodes, premiered on October 8, 2012, and ended on December 17, 2012.[2][3]\n\nA sequel series, also titled Gossip Girl and headed by original executive producers Schwartz, Savage and Safran, will release in 2021 on the HBO Max streaming service.

Blair Waldorf discovers Serena had slept with her boyfriend, Nate Archibald, the night of her disappearance. Meanwhile, Brooklynite Dan Humphrey and Serena begin dating while Nate struggles with his feelings for Blair. Nate and Blair try to salvage their relationship, driving Blair to lose her virginity to Nate\'s best friend, Chuck Bass. Jenny Humphrey, Dan\'s sister, is trying to fit in to the Upper East Side by following around Blair and her friends. Vanessa Abrams, Dan\'s best friend, returns. It is revealed that Dan had confessed his love for Vanessa in the past, but the two move beyond this as friends. It is discovered that Lily Van der Woodsen, Serena\'s mother, and Rufus Humphrey, Dan\'s father, have a romantic past and begin to rekindle their romance but decide to see other people in light of their children\'s romance. Blair and Nate eventually break up, after finally having sex. Nate discovers Blair\'s affair, causing a rift with Chuck. Throughout the season, Chuck tries to seduce Blair and the two somewhat come to terms with their feelings for each other. Georgina Sparks, past friend of Serena, returns, pretending to be a woman named Sarah from Portland. Georgina\'s return reminds Serena of the real reason she left the Upper East Side: she was involved in a drug-related death and felt responsible for the situation. Problems erupt between Dan and Serena, as Serena tries to hide her secret from him. However, the incident is resolved with Serena being absolved of her guilt, and Georgina leaves. Dan and Serena decide to end their relationship. Meanwhile, Lily accepts a marriage proposal from Bart Bass, despite her feelings for Rufus, and the season ends with a Bass wedding and Blair waiting for Chuck at the airport.\n\nSeason 2: 2008\xe2\x80\x932009 [ edit ]\n\nThe second season mainly explores the senior year of the characters with the premiere at the Hamptons and primarily focused on the relationship between Blair and Chuck, who were labeled ""the heart of GG"" by People magazine.[10] At first, both characters deny their feelings for one another, and go through various schemes and manipulations.\n\nThe first half of the season deals with Serena\'s growing prominence as a socialite, which draws the attention of Blair as their friendship is tested when the character of Poppy Lifton (Tamara Feldman) arrives, a socialite who inadvertently drives a wedge between Serena and Blair after inspiring Serena to take her place in the spotlight during the early episodes of the season. Serena and Dan get back together for a brief period of time and eventually break up due to complications.[11] Nate faces the aftermath of his father\'s criminal past and pursues a relationship with Vanessa, who becomes entangled in the world of the Upper East Side. Jenny reignites her rebellious nature by pursuing a career as a fashion designer, thereby challenging Rufus\' skills as a parent while Dan\'s friendship with Nate and relationship with Serena slowly transforms him from a social outcast to an insider. The show finished its first half during the first week of December, with the shocking death of Bart Bass.\n\nThe second half of the season reveals the impact of Bart\'s death, causing a significant change of character direction for Chuck that subsequently leads to the growth of Rufus and Lily\'s relationship, the revelation of the two having a son together, and contributing to the decline of Dan and Serena\'s relationship. John Shea reprised his role as Harold Waldorf during a Thanksgiving episode and becomes entangled in Blair\'s striving ambition of attending Yale. Desmond Harrington entered the series as Chuck\'s manipulative uncle, Jack Bass. Feldman returned to the season with Armie Hammer as Serena\'s new love interest, Gabriel Edwards.[12] Michelle Trachtenberg returned to the role of Georgina Sparks and filmed her scenes during February, also adjoining her character\'s return to the second season mystery.[13]\n\nA backdoor pilot for a spin-off premiered in May, but was not picked up by The CW, due to the limited number of spots available on their fall line-up.[14]\n\nAs the storylines progressed, the role of ""Gossip Girl"" is slightly decreased. She continues to run her blog, but she keeps the ultimate information for herself, sending it in the final episode as the last blast, where Serena decides to find out who ""Gossip Girl"" really is, but ultimately fails. The season finale ended with a well-received kiss between Blair and Chuck. Cameos from season 2 include: Tinsley Mortimer\n\nSeason 3: 2009\xe2\x80\x932010 [ edit ]\n\nThe third season focuses on Blair, Dan and Vanessa getting into New York University along with movie star Olivia Burke (Hilary Duff),[15] whom Dan starts dating; Nate getting into Columbia University; Serena taking a year off from school; Jenny becoming Queen Bee at Constance; and Chuck running Bass Industries, along with now adoptive mother Lily van der Woodsen. The first couple of episodes feature part of the summer vacation, respectively the week before the start of University classes and school. The role of ""Gossip Girl"" is slightly decreased throughout the season.\n\nMany guest stars were cast throughout the season including Joanna Garc\xc3\xada as Bree Buckley, a love interest for Nate; America\'s Next Top Model creator Tyra Banks as Ursula Nyquist, a larger than life actress whom Serena served as a publicist for a short time; William Baldwin as William van der Woodsen, Serena and Eric\'s father, Lily\'s ex-husband and Rufus\xe2\x80\x99 long-time rival; and cameos by Lady Gaga, Tory Burch, Jimmy Fallon, Plastiscines, Georgina Chapman and Sonic Youth.[16][17][18]\n\nThe ninth episode of the season caused a significant amount of controversy. Parent groups urged The CW not to air the episode as it contained a threesome. The preview for the episode revolved around an ""OM3"" theme. CW ignored these requests and announced that it was going to air the episode as planned.[19] Not only did CW ignore these requests but they used the backlash to create new provocative promotional posters.[20]\n\nRobert John Burke, who played Chuck\'s father, Bart Bass, returned for A Christmas Carol themed episode in December, while Desmond Harrington returned as Chuck\'s uncle Jack with a major storyline affecting Chuck and Blair\'s relationship again and involving Chuck\'s estranged mother Evelyn Bass Fisher (Laura Harring).[21][22]\n\nThe season focused on Jenny Humphrey\'s development and downward spiral. She spends a good part of the season alienating herself from Eric, her former best friend, and chasing after Nate, who has his heart set on Serena. At the end of the season, due to her one night stand with Chuck Bass, and new drug dealing habit, Jenny\'s father and Lily send her to Hudson, New York, to live with her mother. Other story lines include: Blair and Chuck\'s attempt and ultimate failure at having a successful relationship; Dan and Vanessa moving from friends to something more; and Serena\'s attempts to find herself through a new job and brief love affairs with Carter, Nate\'s married cousin Tripp, and eventually Nate himself. The season ends dramatically with Chuck getting robbed and shot.\n\nSeason 4: 2010\xe2\x80\x932011 [ edit ]\n\nSeason four\'s main mystery revolves around Juliet Sharp (Katie Cassidy), a secretive girl with an agenda against Serena involving her past. This subplot unravels to reveal that Lily Humphrey, Serena\'s mother, forged Serena\'s signature on an affidavit stating that Juliet\'s brother, Ben, had an intimate relationship with Serena, while Serena was a minor and his student leading to Ben\'s imprisonment. This relationship was confirmed by Serena to be false. The second half of the season builds on the complications of Serena\'s new found relationship with her former teacher Colin, Chuck trying to regain control of Bass Industries from Russell Thorpe (Michael Boatman), and Dan and Blair\'s growing friendship. The season also focuses on Lily\'s past betrayals coming back to haunt her; Chuck and Blair\'s tumultuous relationship after their break up; Dan and Vanessa\'s deteriorating friendship; and the arrival of Serena\'s cousin Charlie Rhodes (Kaylee DeFer) to the Upper East Side. By the end of the season, Blair has ignored Chuck, Dan has told Vanessa they are no longer friends, and Serena is single.\n\nThe first two episodes of the season took place with Serena, Blair, and Chuck in Paris. While in Paris, Blair meets Prince Louis Grimaldi, to whom she later becomes engaged at the end of the season.\n\nTaylor Momsen, who plays Jenny Humphrey, was absent for the majority of the season but made appearances in ""Easy J"", ""Juliet Doesn\'t Live Here Anymore"", ""The Witches of Bushwick"", and ""Gaslit"".[23]\n\nSeason 5: 2011\xe2\x80\x932012 [ edit ]\n\nThe series was renewed by The CW for a fifth season on April 26, 2011.[24]\n\nOn May 9, 2011, it was announced that Taylor Momsen and Jessica Szohr would not be back as series regulars, although both have been invited back as guest stars. Kaylee DeFer, who portrays Ivy Dickens, was promoted to series regular status for season 5.[25]\n\nThe season began in Los Angeles when a re-energized Chuck and Nate decided to pay Serena a visit. Chuck has a newfound philosophy and says ""yes"" to everything, even death defying stunts. Serena continues to work on the movie set, and is offered a full-time job at the end of the episode. Nate begins an affair with an older woman, Diana Payne, who may have an ulterior motive for being with Nate. Back in New York, Dan learns that Vanessa has published one chapter of his novel, and Blair continues to plan her wedding to Louis, and she also learns she is pregnant. After realizing she still had feelings for Chuck, Blair and Chuck decide to go away together, but their car crashes. As a result of the crash Blair loses her baby, Chuck nearly dies, and Blair eventually marries Louis. The season also focuses on Nate running an online gossip site NYSpectator, Blair and Dan\'s friendship turning into a relationship, Chuck\'s quest to find his real parents which leads him to discover that his father, Bart, is still alive, and the effects of CeCe\'s death on Lily and her marriage to Rufus. At the end of the season, Blair makes a choice between Dan and Chuck, and Lily makes a choice between Rufus and Bart. Serena is seen leaving town while Dan decides to write a new book about the Upper East Side, with the help of Georgina.\n\nSeason 6: 2012 [ edit ]\n\nOn May 11, 2012, it was announced Gossip Girl would return for a shortened sixth and final season, which premiered on October 8, 2012.[1][26] During the CW upfronts, network president Mark Pedowitz said the number of episodes had not yet been decided and could consist of 10 episodes with a retrospective, meaning it would end before Christmas.[27]\n\nThe season premiered with 0.78 million viewers tuning in, marking a series low for the show. The following week, there was a further drop in viewership, with only 0.76 million viewers, once again breaking the record for series-low ratings.\n\nOn October 29, 2012, the episode ""Portrait of a Lady Alexander"" was postponed due to the impact of Hurricane Sandy on the Eastern Seaboard. Widespread power outages led to the decision of pushing the new episode back a week and re-airing the previous episode, ""Dirty Rotten Scandal"".[28]\n\nOn December 17, 2012, the series broadcast its finale on U.S. television on the CW network. Actress Kristen Bell, the narrator of the series throughout its run, makes a cameo as herself (but is not revealed as Gossip Girl). Several former Gossip Girl cast members appear in the finale, including Jessica Szohr, who played Vanessa Abrams, and Katie Cassidy, who played Juliet Sharp. Former series regulars Connor Paolo (Eric van der Woodsen) and Taylor Momsen (Jenny Humphrey) each appear also, with one line apiece.\n\nSeason 6 begins with Chuck and Blair who part ways after making a pact that they will unite once they both achieve their individual goals. Chuck goes on his way to try to regain Bass Industries from his father who stole it from him, while Blair tries to find herself and her individuality by taking over her mother\'s company at her mother\'s request. Serena pursues a relationship with someone older and who happens to have a 17-year-old daughter, Sage, who will do anything to try to split them up. Nate focuses on trying to get the NYSpectator to become successful and dates Sage. Meanwhile, Dan focuses on completing his second book with Georgina\'s help. In the end after a surprising turn of events Blair Waldorf (Leighton Meester) and Chuck Bass (Ed Westwick) get married.[29] In the final moments, the series speeds forward five years later where Chuck and Blair are revealed to have had a child and Nate Archibald appears successful and is rumored to be running for mayor of New York. The show ends with the wedding of Serena van der Woodsen and Dan Humphrey, a small ceremony in what looks like Blair and Chuck\'s home together, where Lily is with Serena and Eric\'s father, William, while Rufus seems to be happy with another woman (musician Lisa Loeb, who guest-starred in the first season) along with Dorota, Nate, Jack Bass and Georgina (who are now together), and Jenny and Eric. A brief shot of the NYSpectator reveals that Lola Rhodes and Olivia Burke are now starring in a film about Ivy Dickens, based on her best-selling autobiography.\n\nProduction [ edit ]\n\nDevelopment [ edit ]\n\nThe Gossip Girl book series was originally supposed to be adapted into a film starring Lindsay Lohan with head Gilmore Girls creator Amy Sherman-Palladino.[30] When the film project did not get off the ground, Stephanie Savage and Josh Schwartz took over the project to create a television series. As of October 2006, Schwartz was working on the pilot. He said, ""I was very skeptical. I don\'t want to do The O.C. NYC. But I thought the books were smart. The characters are worldly in a way that Orange County kids aren\'t.""[31] The characteristics for each character in the pilot were based on the first Gossip Girl book.[32] In January 2007, the show was given the green light by The CW.[33]\n\nProduction team [ edit ]\n\nThe O.C. creator Josh Schwartz and fellow writer Stephanie Savage served as the show\'s executive producers throughout the series\' run, followed by Bob Levy and Leslie Morgenstein of Alloy Entertainment, who were assigned in aiding the adaptation of the novels into the series.[33] Following the success of Gossip Girl, Gilmore Girls co-producer, John Stephens was approached by Schwartz and Savage, having previously worked with him on The O.C., and hired him as an executive producer.[34] Joshua Safran, who started as a writer/consulting producer before becoming co-executive producer, was later added as an executive producer. On April 24, 2012, it was announced that he would leave the show at the end of the fifth season to be the new showrunner of NBC\'s now-cancelled musical series Smash.[35] To fill in Safran\'s void, co-executive producer Sara Goodman was promoted to executive producer for the sixth season.[36] Alexandra Patsavas who worked with Schwartz on The O.C. was in charge of the music.[37] Eric Daman was at the head of the costume department; he previously had assisted Patricia Field on Sex and the City.[38]\n\nCasting [ edit ]\n\nVeronica Mars was canceled, the following season of pilots for The CW had been announced, and one was Gossip Girl. I read it, and I knew I was sort of old to play any of the kids. I called Veronica Mars, can I narrate this show? And she said, \'Hey, that\'s a very good idea.\' They knew I had a younger voice, they liked me and they knew I\'d show up for work, and I guess that was all I really needed. It was so clear to me how sassy and catty she needed to be. Whenwas canceled, the following season of pilots for The CW had been announced, and one was. I read it, and I knew I was sort of old to play any of the kids. I called Dawn Ostroff \xe2\x80\x93 who was the head of The CW at the time \xe2\x80\x93 and said, \'Hey, I did so much narration on, can I narrate this show? And she said, \'Hey, that\'s a very good idea.\' They knew I had a younger voice, they liked me and they knew I\'d show up for work, and I guess that was all I really needed. It was so clear to me how sassy and catty she needed to be. \xe2\x80\x94 Kristen Bell on how she landed the narration spot of the show[39]\n\nFeaturing nine regular speaking roles, the majority of the ensemble cast was assembled from February to April 2007. Leighton Meester and Blake Lively\xe2\x80\x93who started auditioning in December 2006[40]\xe2\x80\x93were the first two actresses to be chosen in February for the lead roles of Blair Waldorf and Serena van der Woodsen, respectively.[41] Penn Badgley, who had previously worked with Stephanie Savage on The Mountain,[40] Taylor Momsen, Chace Crawford, Kelly Rutherford, and Connor Paolo also auditioned successfully and landed roles in the series in March, as did Florencia Lozano who appeared only in the pilot, and was later replaced by Margaret Colin.[42][43][44] Badgley at first turned down the part of Dan,[45] as did Lively\xe2\x80\x94who planned to attend college\xe2\x80\x94for the role of Serena.[46] Actors for the roles of Chuck Bass and Rufus Humphrey were found in April when English actor Ed Westwick, and Matthew Settle were cast.[47] Westwick first read for the role of Nate but was then asked to try Chuck.[40] As rumors swirled about the impending cancellation of Veronica Mars, it was revealed at The CW\'s 2007 Upfronts on May 17, 2007, that Kristen Bell had narrated the pilot, thus making her the title character of another show on the network.[48] Jessica Szohr was signed on to portray the recurring role of Vanessa Abrams and received regular status during the fourteenth episode of the first season.[49][50] Kaylee DeFer joined the series in the eighteenth episode of the fourth season and was promoted to series regular for the show\'s fifth season.[51]\n\nAt the conclusion of the fourth season, Momsen, who went on an indefinite hiatus during the season while retaining regular billing,[52][53] and Jessica Szohr both left the show.[54] Throughout the series\' run, Connor Paolo consistently declined to elevate his recurring role of Eric van der Woodsen to regular status, citing personal reasons for his decision.[55] After becoming a regular on the ABC series Revenge, Paolo confirmed his departure from Gossip Girl in August 2011.[56]\n\nAs the show progressed, numerous recurring guest stars appeared in the show. Michelle Trachtenberg signed on to portray Georgina Sparks.[57] The role had previously been offered to Mischa Barton who declined the role.[57] Francie Swift and Sam Robards took the parental roles of Anne and Howard Archibald, respectively.[58][59] Caroline Lagerfelt portrayed Celia ""CeCe"" Rhodes, Serena and Eric\'s grandmother and Lily\'s mother.[60] Sebastian Stan made several appearances as Carter Baizen throughout the show\'s first three seasons.[61]\n\nFilming locations [ edit ]\n\nPrimarily filming in New York, Gossip Girl has been declared by New York Magazine as the ""Most Restauranty Show Since Sex and the City"", citing the pilot episode filming locales such as the Japanese restaurant, Geisha, the Campbell Apartment where Nate and Serena were filmed having sex and the New York Palace Hotel bar Gilt.[62] Other New York City landmarks and well-known establishments were filmed throughout the first season. Victor/Victrola filmed the fictional infamous Chuck Bass burlesque club, Victrola, at The Box Manhattan, a sister club to The Box Soho in London.[63] The fictional Constance Billard-St.Judes School, based on novel writer Cecil Von Ziegesar\'s alma mater, Nightingale-Bamford used external shots of the Museum of the City of New York.[64]\n\nThe second season premiered at the Hamptons and began filming in mid-June. The season premiere opening montage showed a scene at Cooper\'s Beach that was instead filmed in Rockaway Beach followed by an elaborate white party.[65][66] For the sixth episode of the season, Columbia University was used to film the Yale campus, an episode that followed disappointment from Yale fans due to its erroneous portrayal of the admissions process and reliance on Ivy League university stereotypes.[67] During the season\'s seventh episode, the Brooklyn Inn was integrated into the show.[68] Remaining true to its New York locations, the show filmed at the Russian Tea Room.[69][70]\n\nThe fourth season premiered on September 13, 2010, with the first two episodes filmed in Paris.[71][72] New York Magazine revealed several locations shot at the French University, La Sorbonne in the Latin District (or Quartier Latin) of Paris on July 5.[73][74] Other locations include the Mus\xc3\xa9e d\'Orsay, the Eiffel Tower, the Gare du Nord, Avenue Montaigne.[75] and Saint-Germain-des-Pr\xc3\xa9s. Columbia University became the primary filming location for the first few episodes of the season following the Paris story arc.[76]\n\nThe fifth season premiered on September 26, 2011, with the first two episodes filmed in Los Angeles, California.[77]\n\nBecause of its location in New York, executive producer Stephanie Savage said, ""We were quickly told it would be too expensive, too complicated"" at the beginning of the series. She said that it had been proposed to shoot in a Los Angeles studio that would recreate Central Park, but they eventually filmed the series in New York.[78] Savage explained their choice to film there, ""There\'s no New York City on TV, or there wasn\'t when we started making the pilot, except what you could see in the background behind the dead bodies on cop shows. We\'ve never seen the city from the point of view of teenagers. It felt like a world with high stakes for young people."" Schwartz added, ""What\'s funny about these teenagers is they grew up watching Sex and the City, even though it wasn\'t about them. And I think they\'ve probably incorporated that into how they mythologize New York. I fought really hard to shoot the show in New York because we want New York to be a character in the show.""[79] Many scenes were filmed in the Empire Hotel on the Upper West Side.[80]\n\nEpisode format [ edit ]\n\nEach episode begins with the home page of the Gossip Girl website and Serena\'s picture from the pilot episode. Afterward, a recap of events relevant to the upcoming narrative is shown, which ends again with the home page of the website, only this time with a picture from other character(s) with a text about a recent event connected with the picture.\n\nThe narrator is Gossip Girl, voiced by actress Kristen Bell. She begins the recap with the sentence, ""Gossip Girl here, your one and only source into the scandalous lives of Manhattan\'s elite,"" and ends the recap with whispered voices saying ""Where has she been?"" and ""Serena."" Then, the voice of Gossip Girl says, ""And who am I? That\'s one secret I\'ll never tell! You know you love me\xe2\x80\xa6 XOXO, Gossip Girl.""\n\nDuring each episode, there is always a social event taking place, whether small or large. Joshua Safran explained, ""We structure it [the show] so that every week, the episode leads to an event. I feel like it is much like a procedural.""[32]\n\nEpisode titles [ edit ]\n\nAll of the episodes\' titles are based on the name of a film or a novel.[81] For example, episode ""The Wild Brunch"" evokes western film The Wild Bunch and ""Seventeen Candles"" Sixteen Candles.[81] Episode ""All About My Brother"" refers to Pedro Almod\xc3\xb3var\'s All About My Mother while ""Pret-a-Poor-J"" came from Pr\xc3\xaat-\xc3\xa0-Porter.[81] ""There Might Be Blood"" took its title from 2007 film There Will Be Blood.[81] ""The Serena Also Rises"" was titled after novel The Sun Also Rises. The fifth-season episode ""The Big Sleep No More"" was named for the film The Big Sleep and the New York-based production Sleep No More. Episode ""Easy J"" was titled after Emma Stone\'s hit movie Easy A. Episode ""The Age of Dissonance"", which was titled after Edith Wharton\'s novel The Age of Innocence, saw a high school production of the novel taking place,[81] and ""The Blair Bitch Project"" was named after The Blair Witch Project. ""Victor, Victrola"" is named after the British-American musical comedy Victor/Victoria. ""Bad News Blair"" was named after the 1976 movie The Bad News Bears.\n\nJoshua Safran said, ""we draw from classic works like Les Liaisons Dangereuses and The Great Gatsby as much as we do from pop culture.""[32]\n\nProduct placement [ edit ]\n\n""It was really about showing features on a device. We usually do about between six and eight scenes in a season of \'Gossip Girl\' \xe2\x80\x93 you can\'t get that in many shows \xe2\x80\x93 where the characters are using their devices. Initially, it was just a wireless phone, but eventually that became a smartphone, a tablet, all these other types of technology that took them through their day and showed how they used it to get from one place to the next."" \xe2\x80\x94 Barbra Robin, Senior Vice President, Integrated Marketing[82]\n\nGossip Girl is known for its product placement. The show had a contract with Verizon Wireless for its first five seasons; all the characters were seen with phones chosen by the brand until the deal ended by the sixth season.[83] During their contract, Verizon Wireless offered exclusive Gossip Girl content and created a website where ringtones of the songs featured on the show could be downloaded.[84] In the summer of 2008, executives of VitaminWater approached The CW for a placement deal. During the second season, the drinks were mentioned several times in dialogues. The partnership helped pay the costs of shooting on location in the Hamptons.[85] An HP TouchPad was prominently displayed in an episode of the sixth season.[86] According to OneNewsNow.com, other sponsors have included Procter & Gamble, L\'Oreal, Target and Johnson & Johnson, which allowed the series to earn $28.2 million in ad dollars in 2007.[87]\n\nDistribution and release [ edit ]\n\nGossip Girl aired on The CW on Mondays.[88] In addition to the television broadcast of the show, episodes of Gossip Girl have also been released on the Internet. In October 2011, The CW signed a deal allowing all Gossip Girl episodes to be streamed on Netflix.[89] The same month, the network signed a deal with Hulu. Both CWTV.com and Hulu streamed episodes for free, but only the five most recent installments were available for viewing.[90] All seasons of Gossip Girl are also available through the iTunes Store and Amazon Video where each episode can be purchased separately or in complete season sets.\n\nAs of 2012, the series was broadcast in 197 countries.[40]\n\nSyndication [ edit ]\n\nOn July 25, 2012, Style Network announced that it had acquired the off-network rights to Gossip Girl and started airing repeats of the show on August 15, 2012.[91]\n\nHome media [ edit ]\n\nThe DVD sets of each season were released in various regions after their television broadcast.\n\nDVD Name Release dates Technical details Bonus Features Region\n\n1 Region\n\n2 Region\n\n3 Region\n\n4 The Complete First Season August 19, 2008 August 18, 2008 October 22, 2008 April 15, 2009 5-Disc Set\n\nAspect ratio: 1.78:1\n\nLanguage: English\n\nSubtitles: Chinese, English, French, Korean, Portuguese, Spanish, Thai\n\nRunning time: 810 minutes Unaired Scenes\n\nThe Beginning, XOXO: Concept to Execution Featurette\n\nGossip Girl Couture Featurette;\n\nCouture Featurette; A Gossip Girl Wedding Featurette\n\nWedding Featurette LOL: Gag Reel\n\nThe Pierces ""Secret"" and ""Boring"" Music Videos\n\nDownloadable Audiobook of the Original Best-selling Novel, read by Christina Ricci.

Due to the show\'s pedigree as an adaptation of The New York Times bestselling novel series, the show was considered to be one of the more anticipated new shows of the 2007\xe2\x80\x932008 television season. An August 2007 survey by OTX, a global media research and consulting firm, placed the show on the list of top ten new shows that viewers were aware of.[93] Though the pilot was the recipient of many positive reviews from publications such as Variety, The Washington Post, San Francisco Chronicle and the Boston Globe, other reviewers described it as a guilty pleasure rather than an hour\'s worth of must-watch television.[94][95][96][97] Metacritic gave it a score of 59, based on the reviews of 40 different publications.[98]\n\nToward the conclusion of the first season, Janet Malcolm of The New Yorker criticized the show for its deviations from the novels. She has stated that the series was ""related to the original only in the names and outlines of the characters"". She further asserted that, ""Without von Ziegesar\'s fast, mocking commentary to propel them, the TV episodes are sluggish and crass\xe2\x80\x94a move from Barneys to Kmart.""[99] However, author Cecily von Ziegesar has expressed support for the show, noting that all of her major plot points were present in the pilot.[100]\n\nAs the show continued its first season, the response became considerably more positive, and by the second season critical response was favorable. Metacritic gave the new season an improved score of 71. ""Summer\'s been good to this girl,"" claimed Entertainment Weekly, who awarded the series its highest grade of ""A"".[101] The New York Daily News claimed the show had found its footing by stating ""It knows exactly what it wants and needs its new hybrid product to be. The hockey fights video of teen romance drama."" Gossip Girl was designated the ""Greatest Teen Drama of All Time"" by New York magazine.[102] The magazine wrote, ""the show has resurrected the potential for scripted dramas to be effective social satire\xe2\x80\x94to present a world more accurately than a ""reality"" program can. Gossip Girl presents a wealth-eye view of the city, but because it is a cartoon we can laugh along with the conspicuousness of the consumption.""[103]\n\nThe Parents Television Council has shown particular criticism of the series, especially with its ""OMFG"" ad campaign from April 2008.[104] It also named the episode ""Victor/Victrola"" the worst television program of the week in which the episode originally was broadcast.[105] Quotes from the Parents Television Council review, as well as negative quotes from the San Diego Union-Tribune, New York Post and the Boston Herald, were used on various advertisements for the second season. The Hartford Courant chronicled a variety of negative responses to the ads. The ads included quotes like ""Every Parent\'s Nightmare"", ""Mind-Blowingly Inappropriate"" and ""A Nasty Piece of Work"" in what appears to be an effort to continue the \'rebellious teen\' style of the show.[106][107]\n\nWith the approach of the fifth season, New York Magazine reviewed the life expectancy of the show, noting its waning cultural relevancy despite the growing prominence of its actors, and the loss of its status as The CW\'s No.1 show, having been beaten out in terms of ratings by other shows of the network like Supernatural and 90210. ""The series itself hasn\'t quite kept up, even if its plotting is as juicy and lunatic as ever."" and that ""The cast would all rather be making movies, while the showrunners are focusing on launching new projects via their nascent Fake Empire production company (including CW newcomer Hart of Dixie). Barring an unexpected brand reboot or another stab at a spinoff, we\'re afraid the end is near. XOXO.""[108] AOL TV ranked Gossip Girl the 20th Best School Show of All Time and the 4th TV\'s Biggest Guilty Pleasure.[109][110] The show was declared the tenth highest rated show for the first ten years of IMDb.com Pro (2002\xe2\x80\x932012).[111]\n\nThere was much controversy around Dan being revealed as Gossip Girl in the season finale. Dan had always struggled to be an insider among the Upper East Side and had supposedly created Gossip Girl to gain more power and had been the one ""pulling the strings the whole time"" as mentioned by Serena in the finale. However, there was much speculation and controversy regarding this decision. Penn Badgley, who played Dan, stated in an interview that he himself found it funny that they had decided to make him be Gossip Girl as there were too many loopholes in the show for this to make sense. There were times during the show where he would be alone and read a Gossip Girl post and be completely blown away by it.\n\nCultural influence [ edit ]\n\n[Schwartz and Savage] were spearheading: ""What if the Internet is just a place to judge people? What if that\xe2\x80\x99s what it turns into?"" And they turned out to be Nostradamus. \xe2\x80\x94 Kristen Bell on Gossip Girl depicting social media\'s influence[46]\n\nCW executive Dawn Ostroff later compared Gossip Girl\'s role as the show that defined its network to House of Cards for Netflix. Its television audience was never very large, but the show was influential on culture; Savage recalled that the crew likened working on it to working for a lifestyle magazine. A hairstylist for the show compared media interest in Lively\'s hair to that for Jennifer Aniston\'s ""The Rachel"".[46] In 2008, The New York Times reported the show has had a profound impact on retail, saying Gossip Girl is probably ""the first [show] to have been conceived, in part, as a fashion marketing vehicle"". While it has had middling success in terms of ratings, it ""may well be the biggest influence in the youth culture market"", said a trendspotter.[112] However, for Maheen Humayun of The Tempest, the show emphasized toxic cultural traits, like rape culture, that ""messed up a whole generation.""[113] According to Zoe Fox of Mashable, the show popularized social media networks and mobile communication, becoming ""a pioneer in its use of mobile"".[114] In 2008, New York Magazine named the series as ""Best Show Ever"".[102] In 2009, Rolling Stone named the series as ""TV\'s Hottest Show"".[115]\n\nOn January 26, 2012, in honor of the series\' 100th episode, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg visited the set and proclaimed the date Gossip Girl Day, citing the show\'s cultural influence and impact on the economy of the city. ""Gossip Girl has made New York a central character. While Gossip Girl is drawing fans in with its plot twists, the show also attracts many of them to visit New York, contributing to our incredible 50.5 million visitors last year. In fact, the economic impact of Gossip Girl and other television shows and films that are made in New York really can be felt directly in all five boroughs. The 100th episode of Gossip Girl is a real landmark, and I want to congratulate the show\'s cast and crew,"" he stated.[116]\n\nThe popularity of the series was also indirectly responsible for the creation of the reality series NYC Prep, which ran for one season on Bravo.[117][118] The series has been referenced in films such as Fired Up!, Get Him To The Greek, Vampires Suck, Easy A, Just Go With It and Horrible Bosses, and TV series such as Royal Pains, Entourage, Parks and Recreation, Skam, 30 Rock, Skins, and Shameless, among others.[119]\n\nPopular among teenagers and young adults, the Gossip Girl cast has posed on the cover of numerous mainstream magazines, including Rolling Stone, People, Nylon, New York Magazine, TV Guide, New York Post, Vogue, Out Magazine, Details, and Entertainment Weekly.\n\nRatings [ edit ]\n\nThe series premiere was watched by 3.50 million viewers and achieved a 1.6 Adults 18\xe2\x80\x9349, coming in last place in its 9:00 pm timeslot on Wednesday nights.[120] However, the show was noted to have held the best audience retention of America\'s Next Top Model.[121] Benefiting from the network rerunning the show during the 2008 WGA strike,[46] the season ended with 3.00 million viewers.[122] The second season premiered with 3.43 million viewers.[123] The second season ended with 2.23 million viewers.[124] The third season premiered with 2.55 million viewers.[125] The third season ended with 1.96 million viewers.[126] The fourth season premiered to 1.83 million viewers and a 1.0 for adults 18\xe2\x80\x9349.[127] Episode 4.04 hit season highs in all categories with a 2.8 rating in The CW\'s target of Women 18\xe2\x80\x9334, a 1.7 in Adults 18\xe2\x80\x9334 and 1.1 in Adults 18\xe2\x80\x9349.[128] The fourth season ended with 1.36 million viewers.[129] The fifth season premiered with 1.37 million viewers.[130] The fifth season ended with 1.44 million viewers.[131]\n\nDespite this, throughout season five, Gossip Girl continued to see a decrease in viewers. Season six premiered to 0.78 million viewers, making it not only the least viewed season premiere for the series, but also the least viewed episode in show\'s six-year run. The following episode saw a decrease to 0.76 million viewers, which once again marked a new series low in terms of viewers. The series finale was watched by 1.55 million viewers, the highest viewed episode since season four.\n\nSeason Timeslot Season premiere Season finale TV season Rank U.S. viewers (in millions) Rating (adults 18\xe2\x80\x9349) 1 Wednesday 9/8c\n\nMonday 8/7c September 19, 2007 May 19, 2008 2007\xe2\x80\x9308 #196[132] 2.35[132] 1.2[133] 2 Monday 8/7c September 1, 2008 May 18, 2009 2008\xe2\x80\x9309 #168[134] 2.48[134] 1.4[133] 3 Monday 9/8c September 14, 2009 May 17, 2010 2009\xe2\x80\x9310 #135[135] 2.02[135] 1.1[135] 4 September 13, 2010 May 16, 2011 2010\xe2\x80\x9311 #139[136] 1.64[137] 0.8[138] 5 Monday 8/7c September 26, 2011 May 14, 2012 2011\xe2\x80\x9312 #188[139] 1.18[140] 0.6[140] 6 Monday 9/8c October 8, 2012 December 17, 2012 2012\xe2\x80\x9313 #140[141] 0.90[142] 0.5[142]\n\nAwards and accolades [ edit ]\n\nDVR ratings [ edit ]\n\n2007\n\n2008 [2]\n\n2009\n\n2010 [3]\n\n2011 [4]\n\nOnline ratings [ edit ]\n\nThe series was the 5th most-binged TV series on Subscription Video-on-Demand (SVOD) Services; derived from NPD\'s VideoWatch Digital, consumer tracker based on data from 313,866 SVOD TV transactions across 26,176 SVOD subscribers that were completed between January 2012 and January 2013.[163]\n\nMerchandise [ edit ]\n\nSoundtrack [ edit ]\n\nThe first soundtrack of the TV series, OMFGG \xe2\x80\x93 Original Music Featured On Gossip Girl, No. 1 was released digitally on September 2, 2008, and in stores on October 28, 2008.[164]\n\nFashion [ edit ]\n\nMerchants, designers and trend consultants say that ""Gossip Girl"" ... is one of the biggest influences on how young women spend.

Some brands paid a fee, and the show\'s Web site provided referral links so viewers could purchase items they saw on television.[112] In 2009, Anna Sui created a line inspired by Gossip Girl.[165] Daman, who based his costumes on what Manhattan private-school students wore,[112], said that by the sixth season the show was ""getting one-of-a-kind couture from Paris"", because ""they wanted their wares on Blake Lively"".[166]\n\nOn September 16, 2011, it was announced that Warner Bros. and label Romeo & Juliet Couture had partnered to create Gossip Girl\'s official clothing line inspired by lead characters Serena van der Woodsen and Blair Waldorf.[167] The launch of the fashion line took place on September 26, 2011, the same day as the premiere of the fifth season.[citation needed]\n\nCosmetics online retailer Birchbox and Gossip Girl have teamed up to create a special Birchbox edition filled with beauty products inspired by the show. The products were chosen by Gossip Girl\'s makeup department head, Amy Tagliamonti, and hair department head, Jennifer Johnson.[168]\n\nInternational adaptations [ edit ]\n\nGossip Girl spawned several adaptations in other countries. The Turkish version is known as K\xc3\xbc\xc3\xa7\xc3\xbck S\xc4\xb1rlar (Little Secrets).[169] On March 5, 2012, it was reported that Warner Bros. International Television and Metan Development Group would produce a Chinese teen drama series called China Girl inspired by Gossip Girl. Production was set to start in June 2012 with the show airing in November. The show will follow the lives of students at a university instead of a high school.[170] No news of the actual broadcast followed.\n\nA Mexican version of the series was produced by Mexican producer Pedro Torres as Gossip Girl: Acapulco.[171] The show stars Sof\xc3\xada Sisniega, Oka Giner, Jon Ecker, Vadhir Derbez, Diego Amozurrutia, and Macarena Achaga.[172] Filming of the Mexican adaptation began in January 2013 and the series aired on July 5, 2013, on Televisa.[173][174] The show also aired in the United States on Univision in 2014.[175] It was not renewed for a second season.\n\nAnother version of Gossip Girl aired in Thailand on Channel 3 beginning July 16, 2015, dubbed as Gossip Girl: Thailand.[176]\n\nAn Indonesian adaptation of the show known as Gossip Girl Indonesia, has been announced during the launch of GoPlay, a video-on-demand service by the country\'s popular ridesharing app, Gojek, with Nia Dinata as its showrunner, premiered on the platform on February 14, 2020.[177]\n\nSequel [ edit ]\n\nA sequel to the series is scheduled to be released on WarnerMedia\'s upcoming streaming service HBO Max.[178] The new series has received a 10-episode order and picks up eight years after the original Gossip Girl site went dark, as a new generation of private school teens are introduced to the watchful eye of Gossip Girl.[179] These new characters will also attend the Upper East Side prep school Constance Billard, as did the characters of the original series.[180] Josh Schwartz confirmed the new series will be a continuation rather than a reboot.[181] Leighton Meester, the actress who played Blair Waldorf, confirmed on Good Morning America that she would not be a part of the sequel. When asked, Meester answered, ""I was not asked to be on it, so no.""[182] Chace Crawford also confirmed that he had not been asked to be a part of the sequel; however, he noted he would be open to making an appearance.[183] In November 2019, it was announced Kristen Bell would be returning as the voice of Gossip Girl in the new series.[184]'"

"b'The former \'30 Rock\' star and Donald Trump impersonator reveals the actors he hates (Harrison Ford) and loves (Tina Fey), how he almost died from a drug overdose in the 1980s and the surprising roles he liked the best.\n\nAlec Baldwin is one of the most recognizable and now, with his Donald Trump impersonation, one of the most beloved actors in America. He originated the role of Jack Ryan in The Hunt for Red October (1990) and had an iconic seven-year run as Jack Donaghy on the sitcom 30 Rock. He\xe2\x80\x99s hosted Saturday Night Live more times than anyone else (17) and has been a tabloid target for his acrimonious divorce from Kim Basinger and angry outbursts at his own daughter and at the paparazzi following him around.\n\nNow in Nevertheless (Harper, available today), Baldwin, 59, tells his story for the first time, from his Long Island childhood to his early stardom (and trouble with drugs) to his current renaissance. From the revelations about his drug use to the actors and directors he hates (Harrison Ford, Oliver Stone) and loves (Tina Fey, of course), here are the 10 most interesting things to learn in the book:\n\n1. He\xe2\x80\x99s a lot more like Donald Trump than he lets on.\n\nNot in their politics, of course; Baldwin is as much an old-school liberal Democrat as you\xe2\x80\x99ll find. And not in their humanity, either. For all his faults \xe2\x80\x94 and they are many \xe2\x80\x94 Baldwin is ultimately a much kinder, decent, more humane person than Trump, if for no other reason than the actor is pretty self-aware about his flaws and genuinely contrite for some of his worst behavior (like that infamous 2007 screaming voicemail left for daughter Ireland). But in other ways, ways that I suspect helps Baldwin play Trump, they are similar. Both are men of great appetites (figuratively speaking). The people they love, they really love. The people they hate, they really hate. Both are easy to anger. Both hold grudges for a long time (see below about Ford and ex-wife Basinger as evidence). Both have daddy issues, trying to live up to what they imagine are the expectations of their larger-than-life fathers (Fred Trump the developer, Alex Baldwin, Jr. the beloved history teacher). And both are homebodies deeply shaped by their New York youth (Queens for Trump, Long Island for Baldwin).\n\n2. He almost killed himself with drugs and booze in the 1980s.\n\nIn the first blush of fame in the early \'80s, Baldwin became addicted to cocaine and booze and almost died of an overdose while shooting a Knots Landing episode in Oregon, ending up in the hospital for 36 hours. His first crack at AA didn\xe2\x80\x99t stick and he relapsed at the end of 1984. The second try stuck and Baldwin has been sober since Feb. 23, 1985.\n\n3. He\xe2\x80\x99s still angry at Kim Basinger, but sorry about that voicemail.\n\nBaldwin\xe2\x80\x99s 1993 marriage to the actress devolved into an acrimonious divorce in 2002 and a continuing custody battle over daughter Ireland. He\xe2\x80\x99s still bitter about it and her role in 2007 in leaking the infamous angry voicemail where he called Ireland a pig, among other things. But he\xe2\x80\x99s contrite about the voicemail itself. He writes that his relationship with Ireland has healed, but the incident \xe2\x80\x9cpermanently harmed\xe2\x80\x9d their bond.\n\n4. He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like Harrison Ford.\n\nOne of Baldwin\xe2\x80\x99s breakout movie roles was as Jack Ryan in Hunt for Red October, but when it came time to negotiate a deal for the sequel, he learned the studio was talking to Ford to replace him behind his back. Hunt for Red October director John McTiernan asked Ford if backstabbing Baldwin bothered him. Ford\'s reply? \xe2\x80\x9cF\xe2\x80\x94 him.\xe2\x80\x9d Baldwin writes, \xe2\x80\x9cHe was playing a different game. In the need of the next franchise to keep the flame of his stardom burning bright while earning him tens of millions more, what choice did he have? The carpenter who walked onto a set [Star Wars] and then into movie history knew that these roles were his legacy.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n5. ...or Oliver Stone.\n\nBaldwin made Talk Radio with the director and does not mince words about how much he disliked the 1988 experience: \xe2\x80\x9cStone\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98technique\xe2\x80\x99 was to generate as much tension on the set as he believed the film required. With sarcastic asides and a passive-aggressive tone throughout, Stone drove the cast and crew to drink a lot.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n6. ...or even his own work.\n\nDespite a career that has lasted over 30 years and includes over 120 credits, Baldwin doesn\xe2\x80\x99t think much of his own work. He writes that \xe2\x80\x9cthe final ten minutes of The Edge are the only piece of my own film work I can ever watch and enjoy.\xe2\x80\x9d State and Main \xe2\x80\x9cis one of the few of my own movies that I can stand watching.\xe2\x80\x9d 30 Rock, though, made an impression on him, more than his graduating from high school or college. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen 30 Rock ended, all of the feelings one associates with the end of something seminal \xe2\x80\x94 feelings that I had missed or squandered earlier, that comes from truly investing in an experience \xe2\x80\x94 finally came out. That was my graduation.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n7. But he has high praise for other co-stars and actors.\n\nHe fell in love with Michelle Pfeiffer \xe2\x80\x94 like everyone else who met her then \xe2\x80\x94 during the making of Married to the Mob. Ben Affleck is a \xe2\x80\x9cprince.\xe2\x80\x9d Miami Blues co-star Jennifer Jason Leigh is a great actor. Matt Damon has \xe2\x80\x9cwarmth and humanity.\xe2\x80\x9d He loved his one day on the set Notting Hill because, \xe2\x80\x9cI got to breathe the same air as the remarkable Julia Roberts.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n8. His love of Tina Fey rules all (but he didn\'t think much of her husband at first).\n\n""When I first met Tina Fey \xe2\x80\x94 beautiful and brunette, smart and funny, by turns smug and diffident and completely uninterested in me or anything I had to say \xe2\x80\x94 I had the same reaction that I\xe2\x80\x99m sure many men and women have: I fell in love.\xe2\x80\x9d And then Saturday Night Live\xe2\x80\x99s talent coordinator Marci Klein introduced him to Fey\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ctravel size\xe2\x80\x9d husband Jeff Richmond, leading Baldwin to think: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s she doing with him?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n8. Anthony Hopkins does a mean Richard Burton impersonation.\n\nOn the set of 1997\xe2\x80\x99s The Edge, the two actors amused themselves with dueling impersonations of the legendary actor (and Elizabeth Taylor spouse). \xe2\x80\x9cThe goal was to not only impersonate Burton but to distill the self-destructive genius down to his essence."" Hopkins killed it: \xe2\x80\x9cTony won the game for all time with his almost haiku-like incantation: \xe2\x80\x98Elizabeth! Baubles and stones. White wine. Marbella.\xe2\x80\x99 Then he feigned passing out.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n9. His wife Hilaria nails him for his narcissism and has maybe the best line in the book.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I\xe2\x80\x99m not with you, I still exist.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n10. Is he running for office?\n\nBaldwin has long denied that he\xe2\x80\x99d run for office, squashing speculation about runs for mayor of New York City, governor, senator or even president. And he repeats it in the book, but one chapter reads like a campaign manifesto where he criticizes voter suppression and Middle East policy, explores why Hillary Clinton lost and offers some thoughts on what a president should do.'"

We also apologize for putting Kendall Jenner in this position.""\n\nIn the ad released Tuesday, Jenner is in the middle of a photo shoot when she happens to notice a protest march making its way down the street.\n\nIt\'s not clear what the smiling, attractive demonstrators are upset about, the only clues being their placards reading ""peace"" and ""love"" and ""join the conversation.""\n\nBut Jenner decides to join them anyway, beckoned into the throng by a handsome man with a cello. She rips off her blonde wig, wipes away her lipstick and joins the marchers. The beaming, break-dancing protesters are a far cry from the often fractious demonstrations that have broken out across the United States over the past few years.\n\n""They ain\'t have no more damn Pepsi at the store!"" pic.twitter.com/lVb8hA7Feo \xe2\x80\x94 malibu nova (@theBrittdoll) April 5, 2017\n\nIn Pepsi\'s version, no one seems too worked up about anything. Jenner fist-bumps one of her recently adopted activists, before grabbing a can of Pepsi from a well-stocked ice-bucket.\n\nThen comes the ad\'s climax \xe2\x80\x94 and perhaps the part that has caused most uproar. Jenner reaches the remarkably calm front-line of the protest. She spots an officer, walks up to him and hands him the Pepsi.\n\nHe takes a sip, a woman wearing a nose-ring and a traditional Muslim headscarf takes a photograph and everybody cheers.\n\nThe ad has sparked accusations that Pepsi has appropriated a racial protest movement to sell a global fizzy drinks brand.\n\n""This ad trivializes the urgency of the issues and it diminishes the seriousness and the gravity of why we got into the street in the first place,"" activist DeRay McKesson told NBC News correspondent Gabe Gutierrez.\n\nMcKesson, who organized and protested in Ferguson after the death of Michael Brown, also takes issue with the brand\'s apology. ""Pepsi didn\'t apologize to all of the people who have been protesting for two years, didn\'t apologize to the people who dedicated their lives and their time to these issues and to understand the urgency of them because in so many cases, there\'s so much at stake including people\'s lives,"" he said.\n\nIt drew scathing criticism on social media from Bernice King, the youngest daughter of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. She posted an image of her father mid-peaceful protest \xe2\x80\x94 literally being pushed back by a police line and tweeted: ""If only Daddy would have known about the power of #Pepsi.""\n\nIf only Daddy would have known about the power of #Pepsi. pic.twitter.com/FA6JPrY72V \xe2\x80\x94 Be A King (@BerniceKing) April 5, 2017\n\nPepsi in turn responded directly to King, ""We at Pepsi believe in the legacy of Dr. King & meant absolutely no disrespect to him & others who fight for justice.""\n\n@BerniceKing We at Pepsi believe in the legacy of Dr. King & meant absolutely no disrespect to him & others who fight for justice. pic.twitter.com/rM8W8i0Euu \xe2\x80\x94 Pepsi\xe2\x84\xa2 (@pepsi) April 5, 2017\n\nMany people believe the final scene of the ad in particular is a direct reference to one of the defining images of the Black Lives Matter movement: a photograph of Ieshia Evans, a 28-year-old nurse being detained in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.\n\nI\'m boycotting all @Pepsi products until they apologize for this blasphemy.

"b'Just when Kyle West gets his life together, Terence has to go and ruin his progress. On the April 9 episode of \xe2\x80\x98The Arrangement,\xe2\x80\x99 Kyle\xe2\x80\x99s ex professes her love for him, Megan\xe2\x80\x99s director just won\xe2\x80\x99t let her go, and Kyle goes to great lengths to save Terence.\n\nI need an assistant like Kyle has. Nate organizes Kyle\xe2\x80\x99s entire life from his clothes to food to getting a pair of special roller skates off Ebay. Apparently, Kyle was a jam skater back in the day and has to hone his skills before an interview.\n\nAs Megan and Kyle are having breakfast, Lisbeth calls. Kyle doesn\xe2\x80\x99t answer, but you can tell he\xe2\x80\x99s caught off guard. He goes to Terence to talk it out. Lisbeth is going on TV for an interview. According to the terms of the agreement she signed, she\xe2\x80\x99s not supposed to contact Kyle at all.\n\nTerence is pissed that Lisbeth is back in Kyle\xe2\x80\x99s life. She\xe2\x80\x99s a liability. He warns Kyle that she \xe2\x80\x9cknows everything about you that nobody is supposed to know.\xe2\x80\x9d As much as Terence wants to get involved, Kyle wants to set his own boundaries with Lisbeth. He can\xe2\x80\x99t act like his past doesn\xe2\x80\x99t exist. He admits to Terence that he\xe2\x80\x99s already called Lisbeth back and wished her well.\n\nThe reason for Lisbeth\xe2\x80\x99s call isn\xe2\x80\x99t coincidental. She\xe2\x80\x99s broke and has been kicked off a movie for being late and having meltdowns. She\xe2\x80\x99s spiraling and wants to drag Kyle down with her.\n\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t Be Stupid\n\nMeanwhile, Megan and the director, Nate, are still flirting as they work on the play. Leslie notices and gives Megan a lecture. More than anything else, Megan is under contract and has it made being Kyle\xe2\x80\x99s girlfriend. Don\xe2\x80\x99t be stupid, Leslie advises.\n\nMegan winds up listening to Lisbeth\xe2\x80\x99s interview. Even though she left Kyle on their wedding day, she declares that Kyle is the love of her life! Kyle walks in on Megan listening to all of this and assures her that Lisbeth\xe2\x80\x99s confession doesn\xe2\x80\x99t change anything. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re the center of my world,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s not changing.\xe2\x80\x9d However, he does basically admit that he\xe2\x80\x99s not completely over Lisbeth. At least he\xe2\x80\x99s being honest!\n\nTerence has an even bigger problem on his hands than Lisbeth. The LAPD detective stops by IHM again to tell Terence that a body\xe2\x80\x99s been found, and she thinks it\xe2\x80\x99s Sophie, Kyle\xe2\x80\x99s former therapist and booty call. Terence, what the heck did you do?!\n\nNate is so in love with Megan. He truly thinks they\xe2\x80\x99re meant to be together and wants her to leave Kyle. She can\xe2\x80\x99t believe what she\xe2\x80\x99s hearing and thinks he\xe2\x80\x99s crazy. This is the same girl who met Kyle West and went to Mexico with him on the same day. She walks out, but Nate ends up in the car. He pleads with her to drive to the desert to spend one night together to see what they have.\n\nThis guy is a stage 5 clinger. Run, Megan, run! Suddenly, a car rear ends them. It\xe2\x80\x99s same car who followed Megan at the bonfire! Megan immediately goes to Kyle and asks if Terence is having her followed. He secretly knows that Terence has been because he goes to confront his mentor the next day at the Institute. He interrupts Terence talking with the security guy, Connor, who killed Sophie.\n\nBlast From The Past\n\nKyle demands that Terence stop having Megan followed. Kyle swears Megan\xe2\x80\x99s not hiding anything and won\xe2\x80\x99t hurt him. Terence storms out. His life is starting to spiral. It just gets worse. When Terence and Connor meet up to talk it out again, Connor shoots himself in the head in front of Terence.\n\nLater, Lisbeth stops by Kyle\xe2\x80\x99s place. Kyle keeps her at a distance, but she manages to get under his skin. \xe2\x80\x9cI meant every word,\xe2\x80\x9d she tells him about the interview. \xe2\x80\x9cI love you. I always will.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nKyle doesn\xe2\x80\x99t say anything like, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t love you anymore.\xe2\x80\x9d No, all he says is, \xe2\x80\x9cYou left.\xe2\x80\x9d They kiss! Kyle tells her, \xe2\x80\x9cYou left. We can\xe2\x80\x99t go back.\xe2\x80\x9d Lisbeth urges Kyle that if he wants his relationship with Megan to work, then stay away from Terence and the Institute. If he wants to ruin his relationship, she\xe2\x80\x99s always available.\n\nKyle ends up buying Megan a new Maserati, partly because she needed one and likely because he\xe2\x80\x99s feeling guilty about Lisbeth. While this may seem like an over-the-top present, this is nothing for Kyle. He can afford 100 Maseratis.\n\nA Deal Made By The Devil\n\nTerence meets with the detective. The Sophie case is pretty much closed, but she\xe2\x80\x99s not letting it go. She knows there\xe2\x80\x99s something going on. He\xe2\x80\x99s willing to pay her any amount of money, but she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want that. She wants something else, rather someone else. The detective wants to have sex with Kyle. That\xe2\x80\x99s all. If Kyle agrees, she\xe2\x80\x99ll drop the investigation.\n\nKyle refuses at first, but Terence goes for the jugular. He tells Kyle to remember everything he\xe2\x80\x99s fixed for him. \xe2\x80\x9cI made you and I love you, but I will end you in a heartbeat if I have to,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. BOOM. So that\xe2\x80\x99s where Terence really stands.\n\nIn case you didn\xe2\x80\x99t already know, Anika is batsh*t crazy. She initiates a racy rendezvous with Deann in the car, but things take a turn when Anika starts CHOKING Deann! But Deann doesn\xe2\x80\x99t run in the other direction. After the studio tells that Kyle\xe2\x80\x99s directorial debut film isn\xe2\x80\x99t happening, she goes to Anika\xe2\x80\x99s to let loose.\n\nMegan professes her love to Kyle and reveals how happy she truly is with him just as he\xe2\x80\x99s about to do something really shady. To make everything worst, Terence watches the whole encounter between Kyle and the detective. He\xe2\x80\x99s taking creepy to an insanely dark and twisted level. Terence is disgusting. Kyle should get an Oscar for his performance.\n\nWhen it\xe2\x80\x99s over, the light in Kyle\xe2\x80\x99s eyes have darkened. He looks lost. He still makes it to Megan\xe2\x80\x99s play. Megan is incredible. Kyle cries in the audience, but not about Megan\xe2\x80\x99s performance. He\xe2\x80\x99s crying about what he just did and how he has to keep it from Megan. Just when Kyle gets himself out of a hole, Terence pushes him in another one.\n\nHollywoodLifers, what did you think of tonight\xe2\x80\x99s episode of The Arrangement? Let me know!'"
"b""Instagram\n\nEveryone has a cheat day, including Chris Pratt!\n\nThe 37-year-old actor was on the set of Universal Pictures' upcoming \xe2\x80\x9cJurassic World\xe2\x80\x9d sequel, where he took a very deserved carrot cake muffin break and filmed his enjoyment with a hilarious rap called \xe2\x80\x9cWhat's My Snack\xe2\x80\x9d posted to his Facebook page.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat's up? It's you boy Chris Pratt/Coming back with an episode of What's My Snack? Last chapter/You ain't seen nothin'/What's my snack? It's a carrot cake muffin/I'll be stuffin' this muff up in my grill/Look at the carrot cake crumbs I spill/I don't even like it, but I'm eatin' it still/'Cause I'm sitting her within' away to nothin'/Uh-oh, eating carrot cake muffin.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPratt is currently on a strict diet for filming so when he finally took a bite of his snack he said: \xe2\x80\x9cOoh, it's so good! More like What's My Crack? That's good!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThen his guilty smile appeared.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan I be honest with you,\xe2\x80\x9d Pratt asked the camera. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is my snack for tomorrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPratt kept his humor alive in his caption that went with his video: \xe2\x80\x9cIt is said that when you fast you have visions. It goes back to the Bible and probably before. It's a spiritual experience to say the least. I'm not fasting per se, but I am definitely at the point in this diet where I've began metabolizing my own brain for energy. Not to brag. If your body gets so hungry you start eating your own brain matter for energy, keep going! You're almost there! It means the love handles are next! And then you will be complete. You will have arrived at the destination. And forever you will be happy. Just kidding.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd then things got serious. \xe2\x80\x9cDon't do it. Not worth it. Go get some Doritos or skittles. Both of which have Starlord's face on them right now!!!\xe2\x80\x9d"""
"b'Megan goes back home and finally opens up to Kyle about her past on the April 16 episode of \xe2\x80\x98The Arrangement.\xe2\x80\x99 Plus, Terence goes on a weird drug-induced trip that reveals what he really wants.\n\nKyle and Megan kick off their day with some hot sex in bed. Unfortunately, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t stay as steamy at they would have preferred. Megan and Kyle are plagued by thoughts of Nate and the LAPD detective. They\xe2\x80\x99re both keeping secrets from each other, and it\xe2\x80\x99s weighing on them.\n\nMegan\xe2\x80\x99s best friend, Tessa, is getting married so she has to head back home for the weekend. She\xe2\x80\x99s officiating! Kyle can\xe2\x80\x99t go because of a work commitment. It\xe2\x80\x99s awkward between them because they\xe2\x80\x99re keeping secrets. Come on, guys. Get it together!\n\nNate calls Megan and says the play might get a run in New York. He needs her help in a meeting to move this forward. Megan is going to be on the east coast for the wedding, so a short trip to NYC isn\xe2\x80\x99t a problem. The thing is, she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t tell Kyle about Nate\xe2\x80\x99s call.\n\nUnderstandably, Kyle is beyond pissed at Terence for forcing him to have sex with the LAPD detective. Kyle\xe2\x80\x99s been avoiding Terence since it all went down. Terence isn\xe2\x80\x99t going to let that fly. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have to fix this together,\xe2\x80\x9d Terence says. \xe2\x80\x9cWith bullsh*t conversations and apologies and you trying to convince me that everything you did was OK?\xe2\x80\x9d Kyle snaps back. Terence tries to calm Kyle down, but Kyle just slams him against a wall. Kyle is finally seeing Terence for who he truly is.\n\nThe Other Side Of Megan Morrison\n\nWith all the drama going on, Kyle decides he needs to get out of LA. He asks Megan to go to wedding with her. She gets a hint that something\xe2\x80\x99s wrong, but Kyle won\xe2\x80\x99t open up to her. There\xe2\x80\x99s also something up with Megan. The last time Megan was back home was for her mother\xe2\x80\x99s funeral.\n\nMegan\xe2\x80\x99s BFF Tessa is a trip. She can read Megan like a book. Immediately, Tessa knows that Megan is conflicted about her new life. Kyle is introduced to Tessa\xe2\x80\x99s family, who happen to be Megan\xe2\x80\x99s second family. Kyle is seeing a side to Megan that he\xe2\x80\x99s never seen before. But there\xe2\x80\x99s a part of Megan who\xe2\x80\x99s not so sure Kyle is going to like what he sees. Later, Tessa asks Megan how it\xe2\x80\x99s going with Kyle. Megan admits that they\xe2\x80\x99ve always had this unspoken, deep connection. She\xe2\x80\x99s just worried that things will fly off the rails.\n\nWhen Megan and Kyle head up to Tessa\xe2\x80\x99s room to crash, Megan\xe2\x80\x99s sees a picture of another friend up on the wall. This woman, Rebecca, is going to be at the wedding. Megan is not OK with it. There\xe2\x80\x99s some drama over a guy named Evan. When Megan goes to get some water, she hallucinates a mysterious man and can\xe2\x80\x99t stop shaking. She breaks down and starts crying.\n\nA Crazy Trip\n\nMeanwhile, Terence goes to see a doctor named Isaac. He takes mushrooms and is encased in a vault filled with water. He goes on a wild trip to figure out what\xe2\x80\x99s wrong with him. This trip takes him deep inside his subconscious and unearths some very interesting things about Terence. During this hallucination, Terence is Kyle. He has everything Kyle has \xe2\x80\x94 movie career, fame, and Megan. He wants to be Kyle and have Kyle\xe2\x80\x99s life. This guy is twisted AF.\n\nTerence\xe2\x80\x99s trip ends with him coming face-to-face with Kyle. Here\xe2\x80\x99s the thing about Terence, he knows he\xe2\x80\x99s effed up. \xe2\x80\x9cI built my life around helping people, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t care about anybody,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. He asks Kyle for help but ends up strangling him. WTF?!\n\nMegan officiates the wedding and spots Rebecca in the crowd. She gets a bit shaken up and Kyle notices. At the the reception, Rebecca comes up to Megan. When Rebecca starts talking about Evan, Megan walks away. Kyle follows and begs Megan to open up. She doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to talk about Evan. Megan and Kyle dance, but she freaks when she hallucinates Evan again.\n\nA Shocking & Devastating Reveal\n\nOnce again, Kyle tries to help Megan, but she shuts him out. When he\xe2\x80\x99s walking away, she admits she\xe2\x80\x99s upset over her step-brother. She reveals that he molested her when she was 11 years old. She feels like a terrible person because, when he started dating Rebecca, she thought she did something wrong. Rebecca has no idea that Evan took advantage of Megan. That\xe2\x80\x99s why it\xe2\x80\x99s awkward. Thankfully, Evan is no longer a part of the equation. He died after getting mixed up with the wrong crowd, but his presence still lingers.\n\nAfter Megan finally opens up, her relationship with Kyle changes. They\xe2\x80\x99re stronger now. When Megan looks over at Kyle when they\xe2\x80\x99re back at the party, he mouths \xe2\x80\x9cI love you.\xe2\x80\x9d At the end of the day, it\xe2\x80\x99s only Kyle and Megan.\n\nOn their way home, Megan thanks Kyle for being such an amazing boyfriend. \xe2\x80\x9cYou let me be exactly the way I needed to be,\xe2\x80\x9d she says. Kyle made her feel safe and that means more to her than he could ever know. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re always safe with me,\xe2\x80\x9d he assures her.\n\nAfter a rendezvous with Anika, Deann goes to Terence to figure out the next step with Kyle\xe2\x80\x99s directing project. Terence tells Deann to make all the decisions. He\xe2\x80\x99s letting go of all the unnecessary BS (for now) and focusing entirely on IHM.\n\nKyle and Megan get back to LA and find his apartment has been broken into. Nothing\xe2\x80\x99s been stolen, which is weird. The police officer warns that someone was likely trying to make a point that they can come in at any time. Who could it have been? LISBETH?!\n\nHollywoodLifers, what did you think of tonight\xe2\x80\x99s episode of The Arrangement?'"

"b'For the original wrestling promotion, see Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling\n\nAmerican comedy-drama television series\n\nGLOW is an American comedy-drama television series created by Liz Flahive and Carly Mensch for Netflix.[1] The series revolves around a fictionalization of the characters and gimmicks of the 1980s syndicated women\'s professional wrestling circuit Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling (or GLOW) founded by David McLane.[2]\n\nThe first season consists of 10 episodes and was released on June 23, 2017.[3][4] On August 10, 2017, Netflix renewed the series for a second season of 10 episodes, which was released on June 29, 2018.[5] The series was renewed on August 20, 2018, for a third season, which was released on August 9, 2019.[6] On September 20, 2019, the series was renewed for a fourth and final season.[8] However, in October 2020, that decision was reversed by Netflix, and the final season was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic causing a production shutdown.[9]\n\nPremise [ edit ]\n\nIn Los Angeles in 1985, Ruth Wilder, a struggling actress, auditions along with many other women in a fledgling professional wrestling promotion called the Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling (GLOW). Traditionally minded in her approach to acting and highly idealistic, she clashes with GLOW\'s director Sam Sylvia due to his cynical demeanor and often unconventional work style. Ruth discovers early on that Sylvia has employed her former best friend, retired soap opera actress Debbie Eagan to star in the show. Ruth and Debbie had fallen out with one another after Ruth had an affair with Debbie\'s husband, Mark, who Debbie then divorced. The tension between the two women promises either to make or break the developing show. The series follows the personal and professional lives of the fictional show\'s numerous cast and crew as they navigate the 1980s in Southern California and Southern Nevada.\n\nCast [ edit ]\n\nMain [ edit ]\n\nRecurring [ edit ]\n\nThe show\'s cast features several real-life professional wrestlers, most prominently Kia Stevens (Tamm\xc3\xa9), who has wrestled as Awesome Kong for TNA and AEW while wrestling as Kharma for WWE. Others with formal experience include:\n\nHulk Hogan, Ric Flair, and Gorgeous George appear in archived video footage in episodes 1 and 4.\n\nEpisodes [ edit ]\n\nSeason Episodes Originally released 1 10 June 23, 2017 ( ) 2 10 June 29, 2018 ( ) 3 10 August 9, 2019 ( )\n\nProduction [ edit ]\n\nThe idea for the series came when Flahive and Mensch, who at the time were looking to make a new female-centric show, came across the 2012 documentary GLOW: The Story of the Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling.[20][21] Before this, neither woman had heard of the GLOW wrestling promotion, and they became intrigued by the premise of producing a fictionalized version of it.[21] Both women found the storyline intriguing as a way of exploring the aftermath of the 1970s Woman\'s Liberation Movement, with Flahive telling Rolling Stone, ""We wanted to look back on the 1970s, coming out of the women\'s movement, and into the 1980s, and ask the question: Did it work? Did things get better?""[20] To this end, it was important for the series to maintain a tension between whether the league was exploiting women or empowering them.[20]\n\nUrsula Hayden, the owner of the GLOW company, served as a consultant on the series and helped Flahive and Mensch with creating the show. Hayden was also on the original 1980s promotion as Babe, the Farmer\'s Daughter.[22]\n\nChavo Guerrero Jr. of the famous Guerrero wrestling family also served as a consultant on the series and helped train the actresses. His uncle Mando Guerrero had served in the same role for the original series.[23]\n\nFilming [ edit ]\n\nThe series has filmed in several locations in Los Angeles; mainly in the San Fernando Valley. Chavo\'s Boxing Gym, which is GLOW\'s training grounds, was a combination of two locations: the interior was a studio set while the exterior was the rear of the San Fernando Masonic Lodge. The Pink Motel in Sun Valley was used as a stand-in for The Dusty Spur Motel, GLOW\'s sleeping quarters. Other notable locations include the Mayan Theater and the Hollywood Palladium.[24]\n\nPrincipal production on season 2 commenced in October 2017.[25]\n\nMarketing [ edit ]\n\nFor the Spain market, Netflix Espa\xc3\xb1a released a series of promo videos featuring singers Marta S\xc3\xa1nchez and Vicky Larraz. The first video, titled ""No Controles"", features S\xc3\xa1nchez imitating Ruth\'s imaginary wrestler scene from the first episode. The second video has S\xc3\xa1nchez and Larraz squaring off in the ring.[26][27]\n\nFor the Brazil market, Netflix Brasil released a promo video featuring singers Gretchen and Rita Cadillac auditioning for GLOW.[28]\n\nFunko released Pop! Vinyl figures of Ruth and Debbie in mid-2018.[29]\n\nCanceled final season [ edit ]\n\nIn September 2019, Netflix renewed the show for a fourth and final season.[8] On February 19, 2020, Alison Brie posted a photo from the set on Instagram, signaling that they were beginning production on the final episodes. In March 2020, production was shut down on the season due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which had stopped nearly all TV and film productions in Los Angeles. They had already finished the first episode and were about to start filming the second episode.[9]\n\nOn October 5, 2020, creators Liz Flahive and Carly Mensch revealed in a statement that the fourth season was canceled and would not be completed or aired. It was explained that the show had some of the biggest obstacles to overcome as Netflix was trying to figure out how to get their shows back to work, mostly due to uncertainty about how to prevent an outbreak on set with its wrestling theme and increased COVID-19 related costs added to an already expensive budget. The earliest the show\'s final season would have aired was in 2022, which would have been too long of a gap for Netflix to handle, since the previous season aired in 2019.[9]\n\nSoundtrack [ edit ]\n\nThe series features several songs from the 1980s, as well as tracks from the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s.[30] The opening theme used for the full-length opening titles in episode 1 of each season is ""The Warrior"" by Scandal.\n\nSeason 1 songs\n\nSeason 2 songs\n\nSeason 3 songs[31]\n\nQuiet Riot\'s cover of ""Cum On Feel the Noize"" was used for the Season 1 trailer, while ""Maniac"" by Michael Sembello was used for the Season 2 trailer and ""Listen to Your Heart"" by Roxette for the Season 3 trailer. Songs covered by the cast include the Thompson Twins\' ""Hold Me Now"" and Barbra Streisand\'s ""This Is One of Those Moments"".[30]\n\nReception [ edit ]\n\nCritical response [ edit ]\n\nGLOW was praised by critics upon its release. On Rotten Tomatoes, season 1 has a 94% approval rating with an average score of 7.66/10 based on 104 reviews. The site\'s critical consensus reads, ""With spot-on 1980s period detail, knockout writing, and a killer cast, GLOW shines brightly.""[32] The first season has a Metacritic score of 81 out of 100, based on 37 critics, indicating ""universal acclaim"".[33] Darren Franich of Entertainment Weekly gave the first season an A rating, calling it ""a silly-smart masterpiece, with an ensemble cast entirely made up of breakout characters"".[34] Sophie Gilbert of The Atlantic said, ""...it\xe2\x80\x99s just a blast to watch women having so much fun. GLOW fully owns its campiness and its showy aesthetics, but it\xe2\x80\x99s smart and subversive underneath the glitter.""[35]\n\nThe second season received even higher critical acclaim. On Rotten Tomatoes, season 2 has a 98% approval rating with an average score of 8.77/10 based on 83 reviews. The site\'s critical consensus reads, ""Fearlessly led by its excellent ensemble, GLOW\'s second season adds a new layer of drama without sacrificing its self-effacing, delightfully silly humor.""[36] The second season has a Metacritic score of 85 out of 100, based on 20 critics, indicating ""universal acclaim"".[37]\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the third season has an 86% approval rating with an average score of 8/10 based on 64 reviews. The site\'s critical consensus reads, ""GLOW dives even deeper into the lives of its divas to deliver a knock-out third season that solidifies its place as one of TV\'s most compelling\xe2\x80\x94and hilarious\xe2\x80\x94character studies."" [38] The third season has a Metacritic score of 80 out of 100, based on 17 critics, indicating ""universal acclaim"".[39]\n\nWrestling community response [ edit ]\n\nThe series received mixed reactions from some of the original GLOW wrestlers. Jeanne Basone, who wrestled in the promotion as ""Hollywood"", commented that ""Some of the training and the gym and the outfits they get correct."" Patricia Summerland, who played ""Sunny the California Girl"" in the promotion, saw Marc Maron\'s character Sam Sylvia as a stark contrast to original GLOW director Matt Cimber. Eileen O\'Hara, who was known as ""Melody Trouble Vixen (MTV)"", felt that the series did not properly acknowledge how groundbreaking they were.[40] Lisa Moretti, who competed as ""Tina Ferrari"" and would go on to the greatest fame among GLOW alumni as Ivory in the WWF/WWE as a three-time WWF Women\'s Champion during the Attitude Era, said that she was relieved that the series isn\'t a documentary because it was more entertaining to have a mix between fact and fiction.[41]\n\nMore positive reception came from mainstream wrestling figures including Kurt Angle.[42] Ethan Sapienza of Slate noted accurate comparisons between the series and WWE as well as the various regional promotions that made up the National Wrestling Alliance during its heyday.[43]\n\nAccolades [ edit ]\n\nComic book [ edit ]\n\nA four-issue comic book series based on the show was released in March 2019 by IDW Publishing, written by Tini Howard and illustrated by Hannah Templer.

"b'E!\xe2\x80\x99s hit show, The Arrangement has aired two of its episodes from the second season, and from the looks of it, the drama is just getting started! Check out the recaps of episodes 1 and 2 below!\n\nEpisode 1 \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x9cThe Long Game\xe2\x80\x9d Recap from 3/11/2018\n\nIn the first episode of season 2, viewers are brought back to a seemingly happy Megan Morrison (Christine Evangelista) as she and her fianc\xc3\xa9 Kyle West (Josh Henderson) attend their engagement party. Not all is as it seems though, as Megan continues to have flashbacks to her horrible time in the Institute. That\xe2\x80\x99s the Institute for the Higher Mind \xe2\x80\x93 you know, the place that Kyle\xe2\x80\x99s mentor Terence (Michael Vartan) founded.\n\nMegan\xe2\x80\x99s flashbacks and way of \xe2\x80\x9cfaking it\xe2\x80\x9d in all aspects of life have led to rifts in her relationships with Kyle and her agent Leslie (Autumn Reeser). Yet she continues her plan to take down the Institute, with the help of her friend Shaun (Carra Patterson) \xe2\x80\x93 because sometimes, the only way to take something down, is to take it over from the inside.\n\nThe Arrangment Episode 1 Photos\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEpisode 2 \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x9cSurface Tension\xe2\x80\x9d Recap from 3/18/2018\n\nIn the second episode, there\xe2\x80\x99s another red carpet and even more drama as Megan collapses during the event. But who\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x93 or what\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x93 to blame? Kyle\xe2\x80\x99s insistent that it\xe2\x80\x99s not drugs; but Terence seems to be indifferent. Could he somehow be involved? It wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be that far of a stretch considering the hold he already has over Kyle. I wonder if DeAnn (Lexa Doig) will ever draw a line between the two of them before it gets out of hand.\n\nKyle\xe2\x80\x99s movie on the other hand, has one kind of issue: his worries about being a first-time director. Kyle reveals to Megan that he\xe2\x80\x99s unsure of who he is as a director, since he\xe2\x80\x99s always been \xe2\x80\x9chiding behind characters.\xe2\x80\x9d He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know how to feel about being so exposed. So what will all this mean for \xe2\x80\x98Technicolor Highway?\xe2\x80\x99 Guess we\xe2\x80\x99ll have to wait and see!\n\nThe Arrangement Episode 2 Photos\n\nEpisode 3 \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x9cThe Sessions\xe2\x80\x9d Recap from 3/25/18\n\nIn this episode, Megan (Christine Evangelista) and Terence (Michael Vartan) seem to grow closer during their one-on-one sessions. During their first meeting, they delve into their pasts. Well, actually Terence does most of the talking, while Megan\xe2\x80\x99s the one prying him with questions. She\xe2\x80\x99s pulling a \xe2\x80\x9cTerence\xe2\x80\x9d on Terence himself!\n\nThe second meeting sees them acting way more casual, almost like they\xe2\x80\x99re friends or oddly close pals. These meetings are obviously limiting Megan\xe2\x80\x99s time with Kyle, and that can\xe2\x80\x99t be good given their track record this season alone. Megan\xe2\x80\x99s always with Terence, while Kyle takes his lead actor, Xavier (Ruffin Prentiss) under his wing.\n\nWe all know that Kyle just wants his first movie to be great, but how far will he go to make sure that happens? He seems to be very \xe2\x80\x9con edge\xe2\x80\x9d in this episode \xe2\x80\x93 which has led to yet another argument between he and Megan. Megan thinks Kyle\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cprojecting his fears\xe2\x80\x9d onto her by not trusting her with this movie role; he thinks she\xe2\x80\x99s wrong. Never fear though, KyGan fans: they do make up. And Megan gave a killer performance her first day on set, I might add.\n\nOne relationship that\xe2\x80\x99s being further torn apart? Terence and DeAnn. Terence\xe2\x80\x99s time is being taken up by Megan and Shaun (Carra Patterson); while DeAnn (Lexa Doig) makes a decision regarding her affair with Mason (Garcelle Beauvais). But when DeAnn calls Mason to tell her the news, she receives some devastating news. But what exactly happened to Mason? Guess we\xe2\x80\x99ll have to wait and see!\n\nThe Arrangement Episode 3 Photos\n\nEpisode 4 \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x9cScene 23\xe2\x80\x9d Recap from 4/1/18\n\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s tons of romance and revelations in this latest episode. You see Terence and DeAnn finally taking strides in their marriage as well as Kyle and Megan opening up to one another. Then it gets passionate as the vision Kyle has for \xe2\x80\x9cTechnicolor Highway\xe2\x80\x9d being brought to life. All while the ratings are starting to come in for his latest film, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Kill Plan.\xe2\x80\x9d Add in a new and old character and there you have episode 4 of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Arrangement.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLet\xe2\x80\x99s start with Terence and DeAnn. They seem to be on the same page now in terms of what they want: a child! Can you believe it? Well, they sealed the deal, and they seem happy with their life right now. On the other side of things, DeAnn finally met her lover\xe2\x80\x99s son, Wes (played by newcomer Jacob Artist). Mason has unfortunately passed, and DeAnn has a hard time dealing with it. Wes comes into play to help her talk through it and be there for her. Things get a little weird though when he kisses DeAnn. Oops.\n\nKyle\xe2\x80\x99s got quite the duality going on right now: his latest film, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Kill Plan\xe2\x80\x9d is released to the fans, but critics aren\xe2\x80\x99t having it. It\xe2\x80\x99s sinking fast, and it causes Kyle to lose focus on his current project, \xe2\x80\x9cTechnicolor Highway.\xe2\x80\x9d Good thing Megan is there to help calm him. They finally get honest with each other on set and things seem better for them. Plus, Megan performs a killer scene for Kyle\xe2\x80\x99s movie, so it\xe2\x80\x99s a win-win!\n\nAs for the old character that comes back? Hope (Katharine Isabelle) \xe2\x80\x93 Megan\xe2\x80\x99s ex-friend. Megan asks Hope to meet with her because she believes Hope can get her more dirt on the Institute. Shaun doesn\xe2\x80\x99t approve, but Megan goes along with it anyway. Bad thing is, nothing pans out from Hope\xe2\x80\x99s tip. At least, not yet. Speaking of Shaun, she\xe2\x80\x99s been a bit preoccupied with Terence lately\xe2\x80\xa6.well, his seminar, that is. Shaun strips down (literally and figuratively) and shows a side of herself viewers haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen before. Makes for an interesting scene \xe2\x80\x93 definitely a standout.\n\nSo will Megan finally get the dirt she needs to bring IHM down? And what about this Wes character? Will DeAnn have even more drama in her life? And what about Kyle\xe2\x80\x99s movie, will it keep running smoothly? Tune in next week to find out.\n\nThe Arrangement Episode 4 Photos\n\nEpisode 5 \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x9cYou Are Not Alone\xe2\x80\x9d Recap from 4/8/18\n\nThis episode has so many plots for each character or relationship, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to keep track! First up: Kyle and Megan meet with Terence and DeAnn at a party, where all seems romantic for each couple. Although, according to DeAnn, \xe2\x80\x9cmarriage is just temporary\xe2\x80\xa6a negotiation.\xe2\x80\x9d Megan and Kyle don\xe2\x80\x99t ever want to end up like that, but a rumor rocks their world and makes them question each other. Apparently, tabloids have reported that \xe2\x80\x9cKygan\xe2\x80\x9d is fake, and that Megan is in love with her co-star, Xavier. Both of which aren\xe2\x80\x99t true, but you know how it is in Hollywood. Causing even more tension for Kygan is the fact that Megan\xe2\x80\x99s been trying to convince Kyle that Terence has just been riding his coattails. Kyle still feels as though he owes Terence for making him what he is, so it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult for him to get out of Terence\xe2\x80\x99s control.\n\nSpeaking of control, Terence feels like he\xe2\x80\x99s losing it with DeAnn. You\xe2\x80\x99ve got DeAnn admitting her past with Mason (DeAnn\xe2\x80\x99s ex-girlfriend), which leaves Terence angry that DeAnn has such a love for her instead of him. Terence and DeAnn are hitting a wall, Terence is not able to get a handle on Megan, and Terence is losing grip on Kyle because of Megan. Sounds like things aren\xe2\x80\x99t good for Terence right now. One thing though that keeps coming around is Shaun. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if their relationship is going to go past professional or not, but if it does, could Megan\xe2\x80\x99s plan for IHM\xe2\x80\x99s takedown be on the line? And what does Xavier supposedly being in love with Megan mean for Kyle\xe2\x80\x99s movie? Can Terence and DeAnn finally pull themselves together enough to bring a kid into the world?\n\nThe Arrangement Episode 5 Photos\n\nEpisode 6 \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x9cThe Break Up\xe2\x80\x9d Recap from 4/15/18\n\nThis episode is special in a number of ways. First, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got the start of it with a flashback to Kyle\xe2\x80\x99s relationship with Lisbeth. Viewers see Kyle pacing back and forth, trying to get in contact with his then-girlfriend, only to find that she\xe2\x80\x99s left him because \xe2\x80\x9cshe got lost in his world.\xe2\x80\x9d Then we\xe2\x80\x99re brought back to the present day, where the flashback connects to Kyle talking about how his failed relationship relates to his parents\xe2\x80\x99 deaths (his mother from cancer and his father in a car accident). You\xe2\x80\x99ve got Kyle feeling on edge because of this interview he\xe2\x80\x99s conducting for IHM and because his movie isn\xe2\x80\x99t going as well as he\xe2\x80\x99d like. Terence isn\xe2\x80\x99t helping the situation by spewing his \xe2\x80\x9cgive IHM energy and it\xe2\x80\x99ll give it back to you\xe2\x80\x9d advice \xe2\x80\x93 and you can see that the relationship between he and Kyle is strained.\n\nMeanwhile, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got Kyle and Xavier in some weird competition to see who\xe2\x80\x99s the best, or who is right and wrong. This leads to Kyle and Megan fighting, as well as Kyle being jealous over Megan and Xavier spending time together. Viewers then get a look, presumably inside Kyle\xe2\x80\x99s head, as to why he feels this way: his arguments with Lisbeth over her last relationship with Gavin. You see a whole new side of Kyle that\xe2\x80\x99s dark and full of rage. We then cut to Megan\xe2\x80\x99s interview, where she seems to be all happy-go-lucky and sings the Institute\xe2\x80\x99s praises (as does her movie co-star, Xavier). Beneath the surface though, you can tell she wants to expose Terence, which is where Shaun came in to try and find info on the Institute. Yet there\xe2\x80\x99s no such animal (or so it seems), which leaves Megan internally frustrated.\n\nProbably one of the most jarring scenes is Kyle on his motorbike interspersed with flashbacks to his \xe2\x80\x93 surprise! \xe2\x80\x93 drug addiction. This ultimately led to a showdown between Kyle and Terence, that involved a gun. We see that Kyle was desperate and felt unloved, but Terence managed to talk him down. Another intense scene? A flashback from Terence\xe2\x80\x99s POV showed that he and Lisbeth were together \xe2\x80\x93 while she was still engaged to Kyle! They hooked up, and Terence even admitted to being in love with her for a long while. After their escapade, Terence goes to see Kyle and gets him to go to the Facility. What\xe2\x80\x99s crazy about this episode though is that during Kyle\xe2\x80\x99s interview about IHM, he sounds like a robot, repeating word for word what Terence told him about why he needed to go to the Facility. The episode closes with Kyle firing Xavier and Kyle thinking that he\xe2\x80\x99s got it all figured out. Little does he know, things haven\xe2\x80\x99t even begun to go down.\n\nThe Arrangement Episode 6 Photos\n\nEpisode 7 \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x9cOn Location\xe2\x80\x9d Recap from 4/22/18\n\nWe start out with seeing the Kyle has in fact taken Xavier\xe2\x80\x99s part in \xe2\x80\x9cTechnicolor Highway\xe2\x80\x9d, alongside his fianc\xc3\xa9 Megan. Then, Megan goes into an audition where she runs into her former agent, Leslie. Leslie tries to see through to Megan\xe2\x80\x99s real being, but she misses the mark when Megan puts up her \xe2\x80\x9ceverything is fine\xe2\x80\x9d wall. As for her audition? Megan didn\xe2\x80\x99t get the part, and it\xe2\x80\x99s all because the director didn\xe2\x80\x99t want IHM to bring drama to her set. In the first twist of the episode, the real reason Megan didn\xe2\x80\x99t get the part? Her team at Creative Partners pulled her out of the running! This revelation causes a huge fight between Megan and Kyle, because Kyle knew about the \xe2\x80\x9cnon-compete\xe2\x80\x9d agreement in the contract, but didn\xe2\x80\x99t inform Megan.\n\nThey eventually make up by finally telling each other the truth about the contract\xe2\x80\xa6. or so they thought. Turns out Kyle lied about the real reason behind the contract, per Terence\xe2\x80\x99s coaching. It\xe2\x80\x99s insane how much control he has over their whole relationship.\n\nAnother obstacle occurs when Kyle (along with half the crew) get food poisoning. Since he\xe2\x80\x99s unable to direct, it\xe2\x80\x99s up to DeAnn and Megan to make sure his vision stays alive. DeAnn even gets Leslie to help out since they\xe2\x80\x99re so short on camera assistants! DeAnn eventually listens to Leslie\xe2\x80\x99s advice, and it seems as though they finish the scene without any more disasters. A toast by the fireside and they (Leslie, DeAnn and Megan) leave all their issues behind.\n\nBack in LA, Shaun and Terence are still buddy-buddy, except for the fact that Terence is being sneaky with meetings and Shaun is lying to Zach about finding one of the victims of IHM\xe2\x80\x99s Facility. Terence is still trying to pitch this new idea of a \xe2\x80\x9cmagic potion\xe2\x80\x9d that supposedly gives this promise of immortality. He\xe2\x80\x99s even going the extra mile as to dig up dirt on investors in order to get them to sign off! The episode ends with Kyle and Megan truthfully making up when Megan spills that she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t sign the contract if asked again. And Terence tells Shaun that he \xe2\x80\x9cloves\xe2\x80\x9d that she\xe2\x80\x99s completely herself\xe2\x80\xa6. just as she breaks into the IHM database to find out where Julie Woolth (one of the IHM victims) is hiding. So, will Shaun be able to really help Megan? And what about Terence \xe2\x80\x93 will his reign over Kyle\xe2\x80\x99s life be broken down? Or will Kyle continue to follow his lead?\n\nThe Arrangement Episode 7 Photos\n\nEpisode 8 \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x9cPaso Robles\xe2\x80\x9d Recap from 4/29/18\n\nThis episode is full of untold truths and so much drama. First, Kyle runs into Detective Gaffey \xe2\x80\x93 if you remember, he slept with her per Terence\xe2\x80\x99s convincing to keep things quiet regarding the IHM investigation \xe2\x80\x93 while Megan is right there. Talk about awkward. Also odd? The fact that Kyle then keeps having a recurring nightmare about someone trying to kill him. He seems to think it\xe2\x80\x99s related to Detective Gaffey, but Terence seems to think it\xe2\x80\x99s about \xe2\x80\x9csomeone close betraying him.\xe2\x80\x9d Which is it: a guilty conscience or a sign that something else is wrong?\n\nMeanwhile, Megan and Shaun go to Paso Robles, aka: \xe2\x80\x9cwine country\xe2\x80\x9d under the guise of her bachelorette party; when in reality, they\xe2\x80\x99re going to investigate Julie Woolth. When they meet her, she seems all too happy about her experience with IHM. But Megan doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to buy her story. Another story that might not be bought? Zach\xe2\x80\x99s reason for using a burner phone! Kyle caught him talking about \xe2\x80\x9cJulie\xe2\x80\x9d but Zach lies to him and Terence about who Julie is.

Yes, the payments they got from Terence were hush money; but Kyle was the one who put Aaron in the wheelchair. He lost his ability to walk because Kyle lost out to a part in a movie. Terence covered it all up in his own twisted version of an \xe2\x80\x9carrangement.\xe2\x80\x9d What will this mean for Megan and Kyle?

"b'Love In a Time of True Crime\n\nWomen are taught to fear the bogeyman. The real threat is closer to home\n\nIllustration by Shreya Gupta\n\nLast October, I married a Swede. The wedding, which took place the day after the New York Times broke the first Harvey Weinstein assault story, was a Viking whirlwind in a posh Icelandic Airbnb whose claim to fame is that the Biebs once stayed there. The honeymoon was a sun-dappled stay in Portugal. (There were castles. So many castles.) And eight days later, clad in my freshly espoused skin, I found myself smack in the middle of suburban Stockholm legally wedded to a man I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know very well.\n\nStockholm in late October is an uninterrupted iteration of gray. The sky is gray, the silvered tree bark is gray, the tarmac is gray, the buildings are infinite shades of Brutalist gray. Gray as a bloated corpse fished out of Slussen, Stockholm\xe2\x80\x99s landscape lends itself to eldritch imaginings, and mired in this gray, newly wedded and alone in the Stockholm \xe2\x80\x99burbs, I got hooked on Dirty John.\n\nDirty John, in case you aren\xe2\x80\x99t one of the podcast\xe2\x80\x99s more than 10 million listeners or one of the Los Angeles Times article\xe2\x80\x99s many readers, tells the story of a vicious serial con man named John Meehan who romanced, occasionally married, and bilked a multitude of women. The series, which depicts the many ways Meehan preyed upon women, shows the escalating devastation a bad man can cause \xe2\x80\x94 and the ease with which we women can believe that the worst guy is actually Mr. Right.\n\nThe plot centers on Deborah Newell, a fiftysomething SoCal interior designer who met Meehan on Our Time, a dating website for people of a certain age. Like Newell, I am also fiftysomething, and, as she had, I met my man online. Listening to Dear John, hearing the details of internet courtship, I took notice of Newell\xe2\x80\x99s words. As she told her story, one part of my brain racked up similarities between her story and my own: how John had seemed perfect, how he swept her off her feet, how he made her feel loved \xe2\x80\x94 utterly, completely, and thoroughly loved. I listened, and I waited for the other shoe to drop. This wasn\xe2\x80\x99t, I knew, a love story. It was a true crime story, and therefore someone, somewhere, was going to get hurt. I wondered if maybe it would be me.\n\nWhen the chalk outline on the floor is around a woman, the heart of the crime is usually love.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGetting married is maybe the most important decision of your life, and yet it\xe2\x80\x99s often the least rational,\xe2\x80\x9d Chris Goffard, the author of Dirty John, said to me in an email. He is not wrong. In English, we fall in love, and this metaphor is telling. We don\xe2\x80\x99t step mindfully into love. We don\xe2\x80\x99t wade, stroll, amble, or walk in love \xe2\x80\x94 we fall, a verb that conveys love\xe2\x80\x99s loss of control, potential for pain, and unknowable depth.\n\nWho we love \xe2\x80\x94 especially when we\xe2\x80\x99re women \xe2\x80\x94 can be a question of life and death. In 2017, a report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that more than half of all American female homicide victims died at the hands of intimate partners (worldwide, that rate is 38 percent). By contrast, nearly 78 percent of all U.S. homicide victims are male, and less than 10 percent of all murder offenders are women.\n\nTL;DR: When the chalk outline on the floor is around a woman, the heart of the crime is usually love.\n\nDirty John was a smash hit, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not alone. In all its bloodstained forms, true crime abides, whether your poison is podcasts like Serial, This Is Criminal, All Killa No Filla, or My Favorite Murder; television series like Dateline, Snapped, or any of Investigation Discovery\xe2\x80\x99s many shows; documentaries like The Jinx, Making of a Murderer, or Capturing the Friedmans; or books like I\xe2\x80\x99ll Be Gone in the Dark, Fatal Vision, or Killers of the Flower Moon. True crime is so popular that the Oxygen network went (almost) all true crime (almost) all the time a year ago. Just last month, it expanded its true crime roster further, with 10 new programs.\n\nTrue crime is bloody revenge without the mess.\n\nThis is notable. Oxygen, the channel with the tagline \xe2\x80\x9ctelevision for women,\xe2\x80\x9d knows what it\xe2\x80\x99s doing. While true crime as a category is robust across most demographics, its core audience is women \xe2\x80\x94 and most of them fall into that tasty 25-to-45 advertising demographic. Chances are that if you\xe2\x80\x99re reading this piece, you\xe2\x80\x99re a woman, and I see you, my sister. I love true crime in all its permutations, trashy or high class, starkly factual or glossily reenacted. (My passion is true crime that features women criminals, but really, I\xe2\x80\x99m a small-c catholic true crime devourer.)\n\nWomen like me are drawn to true crime for multiple reasons. We like the emotional closure of a solved crime, because many crimes with female victims go unsolved, or we like the ambiguity of an open-ended true crime story for the same reason. Women like true crime because, like horror, true crime feels good, spiking endorphins and adrenaline. We also like it because we can revel in the schadenfreude of a criminal\xe2\x80\x99s capture or the relief of a criminal\xe2\x80\x99s comeuppance.\n\nIllustration by Shreya Gupta\n\nMost immediately appealing to me, as the audience, is that I may move freely between identifying with the victim and identifying with the criminal, allowing me to safely experience a range of emotional experiences, from primal, clenched-throat fear to visceral, rampaging violence. True crime is bloody revenge without the mess.\n\nBut above all, true crime, for all its guts and gore, imbues its female audience with a sense of power \xe2\x80\x94 and that power is knowledge. Most women are smaller, weaker, and less violent than men, and women\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge of our physical limitations is reinforced not only by daily life but also by most narratives. When a woman wins a physical battle against a man, it\xe2\x80\x99s because she\xe2\x80\x99s a literal superhero. True crime allows women to safely learn from the experience of others. Lucky or lamentable, all true crime victims become teachers.\n\nErin Lee Carr, a true crime documentary director and producer, says, \xe2\x80\x9cA lot of the violence that happens in our society is against women or people of color, so it\xe2\x80\x99s women practicing if this were to happen. There\xe2\x80\x99s a part of all of us that\xe2\x80\x99s like, \xe2\x80\x98What would I do if I was in the alley? What would I do if I was put in that situation?\xe2\x80\x99 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s practice.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSarah Weinman, author of the upcoming book The Real Lolita, agrees. \xe2\x80\x9cWomen live their life, whether consciously or unconsciously, dealing with fear,\xe2\x80\x9d she says. \xe2\x80\x9cWomen are always having to make the calculus\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 the best ways not to get raped or killed, she means \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cand it\xe2\x80\x99s running as a background process all the time, 24 hours, seven days a week.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTrue crime, then, can function as a kind of mental training for what to do when the time comes. This is part of the appeal of the wildly popular podcast My Favorite Murder. The hosts, Karen Kilgariff and Georgia Hardstark, close each show by saying, \xe2\x80\x9cStay sexy. Don\xe2\x80\x99t get murdered.\xe2\x80\x9d This slogan \xe2\x80\x94 so popular that fans bond over its acronymic, SSDGM \xe2\x80\x94 distills the show\xe2\x80\x99s spirited essence. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t get in that trunk,\xe2\x80\x9d goes one of My Favorite Murder\xe2\x80\x99s prime pieces of advice. They are indeed words to live by.\n\nTrue crime gives its female audience a handy-dandy, easy-peasy way to recognize dangerous behavior. \xe2\x80\x9cSome have said this series will save lives because it can maybe alert people to the sort of techniques a con man like John Meehan uses,\xe2\x80\x9d Goffard says of Dirty John.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think that women in general are always looking for signs,\xe2\x80\x9d says Lisa Levy, freelance writer and contributing editor at CrimeReads. \xe2\x80\x9cThey look for good signs, they look for bad signs. And I think reading true crime is a way to hone that skill.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPerpetrating a crime displays a human heart\xe2\x80\x99s most primal impulses.\n\nReading, watching, or listening to true crime, in short, affords women the luxury of putting themselves in danger without physical risk and the headspace to prepare themselves without pressure. You can curl up in your vintage velour tracksuit with a glass of buttery chardonnay, turn on Investigation Discovery, and absorb survival skills, almost as if by osmosis.\n\nThus it was almost natural that Dirty John caused me to scrutinize my relationship with my new husband. Holding the whole of our history like an orb in my hand, I looked for flaws, for cracks, for inconsistencies, for untruths. I made a mental checklist of John Meehan\xe2\x80\x99s many \xe2\x80\x9ctells,\xe2\x80\x9d like the way his rumpled clothes didn\xe2\x80\x99t match his claim to be a doctor, his running out of cash when the dinner check came, and his needling comments that pried Deborah Newell away from her friends and her family.\n\nI cross-checked Newell\xe2\x80\x99s narrative and found\xe2\x80\xa6nothing. My husband, for all his very human flaws and superhuman beauty, seemed to be the man I married. I exhaled, and I moved on, and I continue to love both him and true crime.\n\nPerpetrating a crime displays a human heart\xe2\x80\x99s most primal impulses. Experiencing a crime \xe2\x80\x94 even vicariously \xe2\x80\x94 provokes a human body\xe2\x80\x99s most primeval reactions. And solving a crime requires a human mind\xe2\x80\x99s most rational reasoning. It\xe2\x80\x99s a holy trinity of emotion, sensation, and logic. True crime hits a sweet spot that, like dating, was just waiting for the internet. \xe2\x80\x9cTrue crime is a very hot genre in part because of the internet,\xe2\x80\x9d says Levy, the CrimeReads writer. \xe2\x80\x9cThe other thing that does well on the internet are personal essays. You could just say that people have a real desire to read about other people going through bad things, which I think encompasses both genres.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWhen I imagine a Venn diagram of true crime and personal essays, I see a female audience in the middle. Whether by nature or by nurture, women tend to enjoy sensation, and the genres of both true crime and personal essays pull at human emotions and push at human bodies, creating a symphony of feelings, both mental and physical. Both command a largely female audience \xe2\x80\x94 and both are denigrated genres. Finally, both personal essays and true crime have mushroomed because of the internet, because of dating apps, and because of our symbiotic craving for and access to deeply intimate personal experiences.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo much of true crime stories are about how love transmutes into rage, and how rage then leads to murder, but it\xe2\x80\x99s also about wildly unrealistic expectations,\xe2\x80\x9d says true crime writer Sarah Weinman. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you meet somebody online, or it\xe2\x80\x99s exacerbated through text messages or instant message, it creates this world that is both part of the real world but is also removed from it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe phrase \xe2\x80\x9cboth part of the real world and apart from it\xe2\x80\x9d is an apt way to encapsulate the experience of any romance, as much as it is a way of explaining our lives on the web.\n\nThe junction of crime and the internet animates the work of documentary filmmaker Carr. Her two documentaries \xe2\x80\x94 Thought Crimes: The True Case of the Cannibal Cop, which explores the story of Gilberto Valle, a former cop who is obsessed with killing and eating women, and Mommy Dead and Dearest, which tells the twisted story of Gypsy Rose Blanchard, who killed her mother with the help of her boyfriend \xe2\x80\x94 are both Extremely Online. Valle used fetish sites to explore his gory obsession, while wheelchair-bound Blanchard found her boyfriend on a dating site.\n\nNeither Valle\xe2\x80\x99s nor Blanchard\xe2\x80\x99s crimes could have happened without the internet \xe2\x80\x94 and without the internet, we probably wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t know they had. \xe2\x80\x9cNow it\xe2\x80\x99s really hard to commit a crime without the internet being involved,\xe2\x80\x9d Carr says. \xe2\x80\x9cSo, as a voyeur, as a curious person, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s amazing to uncover how people thought about these things and then executed their plans.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nCarr says of her films\xe2\x80\x99 two subjects, \xe2\x80\x9cThey couldn\xe2\x80\x99t truly reveal who they were, so they create these [online] avatars of themselves that represented what they actually desired sexually.\xe2\x80\x9d On the internet, as the classic 1993 New Yorker cartoon says, nobody knows you\xe2\x80\x99re a dog.\n\nIllustration by Shreya Gupta\n\nYet as much as the web has been a boon for criminals, it has also been a godsend to true crime fanatics, allowing us to watch real-time Twitter reactions to Jodi Arias\xe2\x80\x99 murder trial verdict in 2015, read true crime blogs, or take deep dives into serial killers\xe2\x80\x99 Wikipedia entries. But even more, the internet has gifted people with ways to get actively involved with true crime. Some true crime fans do more than passively sit on their couches absorbing lurid stories \xe2\x80\x94 some, like the late Michelle McNamara, the author of I\xe2\x80\x99ll Be Gone in the Dark, start blogs; others join message boards; and still others begin movements like #MeToo.\n\nTrue crime\xe2\x80\x99s potential for evolution is especially meaningful for women because, while we are less likely than men to be murdered, we are more likely to be raped \xe2\x80\x94 and rape is one felony that has yet to be folded into the true crime lexicon as a stand-alone act. Rape, to be treated as true crime, still has to be appended to murder. However, Bill Cosby\xe2\x80\x99s recent conviction on three counts of sexual assault gives true crime a juicy opportunity to recover this glaring omission, as does Weinstein\xe2\x80\x99s recent arrest, and as do the unfolding revelations about R. Kelly, Charlie Rose, and myriad other powerful men.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo what does a rape have to do to be a true crime story?\xe2\x80\x9d Lisa Levy writes in her April 2018 CrimeReads piece. The answer is a depressing mix of \xe2\x80\x9cbe a good victim\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cbe a victim of a serial rapist,\xe2\x80\x9d but often even the story of a perfect victim in a string of brutal crimes isn\xe2\x80\x99t enough. Because, as Levy points out, rape stories are almost always women\xe2\x80\x99s stories.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI started reading books about rape,\xe2\x80\x9d Levy says, \xe2\x80\x9cand what I discovered was there were overwhelmingly memoirs, and I found that to be very interesting. It seemed to be a way to either downgrade rape and sexual assault as a crime or to say: Well, these stories that women are telling, they\xe2\x80\x99re just stories. It\xe2\x80\x99s just autobiography.\xe2\x80\x9d He said/she said, it seems, retains its power imbalance, even in literature.\n\nPerhaps women are taught to be afraid of the wrong men, and perhaps true crime allows women the space to recognize that.\n\nPurists might object that memoir is not true crime \xe2\x80\x94 that the genre requires an objective, outside observer who documents with a cold, calculating, and uninvested eye \xe2\x80\x94 but true crime has often made room for the first-person narrative \xe2\x80\x9cI.\xe2\x80\x9d Michelle McNamara sprinkles her book with her own experiences and feelings. Ann Rule\xe2\x80\x99s The Stranger Beside Me, a book about serial killer Ted Bundy, is as much a eulogy to her friendship with Bundy as it is an investigation into his crimes and capture. Even the hallowed father of serious true crime, Truman Capote, plays with narrative point of view in his classic \xe2\x80\x9cnonfiction novel,\xe2\x80\x9d In Cold Blood. The male writers who followed in his footsteps, people like Gay Talese, James Ellroy, and Dominick Dunne, are all palpable presences in their true crime stories, too.\n\nThe problem, then, is not so much that it\xe2\x80\x99s the women themselves telling the stories of their own experiences and sexual violation. It\xe2\x80\x99s that, in addition to not often getting to trial or to conviction, sexual violence isn\xe2\x80\x99t taken as seriously as homicide or being conned out of cash.\n\nIn the genre of true crime, the crime matters as much as the voice \xe2\x80\x94 and true crime has not taken women as seriously as women take it.\n\nSo why, in the great gray of Stockholm October, did Dirty John resonate so deeply with me? Why did it wake me at night to wonder about the past, hidden lives of the man insensate beside me? What about this story of a California con man rang so true? And how does this con\xe2\x80\x99s story feel inextricable from the onslaught of #MeToo stories that flow like an endless sludgy river?\n\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve turned this mental Rubik\xe2\x80\x99s cube over and over, trying to understand a connection between my suspicions, my feelings, and the haunting specter of my marriage. Sitting here in the hot light of the Stockholm May sun, I look at last winter\xe2\x80\x99s anxiety, and I see the slow, burbling recognition of something that I\xe2\x80\x99d felt \xe2\x80\x94 but never allowed myself to articulate \xe2\x80\x94 was true. And that is this: Perhaps women are taught to be afraid of the wrong men, and perhaps true crime allows women the space to recognize that.\n\nWomen \xe2\x80\x94 especially white women \xe2\x80\x94 are statistically the least endangered, yet we are fearful (a phenomenon called the gender-fear paradox). Women are afraid because, while both little boys and little girls are taught \xe2\x80\x9cstranger danger,\xe2\x80\x9d boys get to drop that fear as they become men; women do not. Women are taught to be afraid of every man we do not know (and even the rustle and the crackle in the dark that could be the men we don\xe2\x80\x99t know). Raised with the specter of the bogeyman, we carry our keys between our fingers, stash our headphones the moment we step off the subway, and learn that regardless of whether you wear unflattering overalls or a tight skirt, it\xe2\x80\x99s somehow your fault. The gender-fear paradox is real, but so too is the fear.\n\nCulture raises women to fear strange men and to trust the men they know \xe2\x80\x94 the very men who, the cold facts tell us, are most likely to harm us. Women are brought up to #marrybestfriend in a #friendshipmarriage as our #relationshipgoals, we\xe2\x80\x99re bred to be deferential to our bosses, and we\xe2\x80\x99re reared to be reverential to celebrity. Our trust in men is as unearned as it is unreciprocated \xe2\x80\x94 yet it\xe2\x80\x99s expected. And this is where true crime\xe2\x80\x99s real value lies: Unlike love songs, unlike rom-coms, and unlike romance novels, true crime has no interest in telling us to trust men. Unlike politicians or bosses, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seek to gaslight women.\n\nTrue crime, unlike just about every other genre that we women clasp to our collective breast, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to sugarcoat the world. It wants to tell us that our suspicions are correct: We are in danger, and the call is coming from inside the house. Only true crime tells us what we need to know to survive the men who want to love us to death \xe2\x80\x94 and this hard, glinting truth may be the reason why women love true crime, until death do us part.'"

"b""Talk shows may be inexpensive to produce, but when it comes to host salaries, shows that want to compete don't spare the coin. And hosts realize they can turn their star appeal and show business acumen into even more cash. So which active late night hosts carry the most coin? Let's see what's in their wallet.\n\n01 of 13 Conan O'Brien: $85 Million Rob Kim / Getty Images Conan O'Brien's quirky brand of late night TV has served him well in basic cable. His clever, fresh show and successful production company net him an estimated net worth of $85 million dollars. He makes $12 million a year on TBS.\n\n02 of 13 Stephen Colbert: $45 Million Frederick M. Brown/Getty Images While Stephen Colbert still holds the No. 2 spot with respect to net worth, Colbert took a pay cut when he moved from to on CBS. Back on Comedy Central, Colbert collected a cool $6. On CBS, he allegedly makes about $4.5 million. His net worth remains a nice $45 million. Why the pay cut? According to reports, it was the move from cable to network television, with the larger audience part of Colbert's overall benefits. We bet it won't be long before Colbert gets a bump in salary.\n\n03 of 13 Jimmy Kimmel: $35 Million Kevin Winter/Getty Images Late night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel's net worth climbs from $25 to $35 million. That's due in part to a pay rise. The host now makes about $10 million a year.\n\n04 of 13 Chelsea Handler: $35 Million Todd Williamson / Getty Images With her streaming shows on Netflix - which are kind of talk shows, we suppose - late night's Chelsea Handler comes in at No. 4. She also increases her net worth to $35 million. She makes a reported $10 million a year as part of her 7-year Netflix contract. Some reports suggested Handler made $12 million a year for her former late night talk show.\n\n05 of 13 Craig Ferguson: $30 Million Jerod Harris / Getty Images Scotland's own Craig Ferguson hits the $30 million net worth marker even after departing his late night show, The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson. Today he hosts a game show and launched a niche talk show on the History Channel, Join or Die with Craig Ferguson. With some stand-up (including working with Netflix), some acting and some writing here and there, Ferguson brings in $8.5 million a year.\n\n06 of 13 Jimmy Fallon: $25 Million Theo Wargo/Getty Images for NBC Tonight Show host Jimmy Fallon is quickly becoming one of late night's greatest talk show hosts. And even though his popularity is surging as host of NBC's iconic late-night program, Jimmy is still in the back of the net worth pack. Still, he makes a leap from $16 million to $25 million since our last update. And his $5 million salary for Late Night has more than doubled to $11 million.\n\n07 of 13 Carson Daly: $15 Million Ray Tamarra/Getty Images Former MTV veejay and one of the more creative talk show hosts on late night, Carson Daly hugs the middle of the list with a $15 million net worth and a $40,000 an episode contract. Daly's net worth is sure to grow, as well. Besides his late-night program, Daly hosts the popular show The Voice and produces NBC's annual New Year's Eve special. He also dabbles in acting and producing.\n\n08 of 13 Seth Meyers: $10 Million Stephen Lovekin/Getty Images Late Night host Seth Meyers enters the list with a net worth of $10 million. As the former SNL host becomes more popular with late night viewers, you can expect that net worth to rise.\n\n09 of 13 James Corden: $10 Million GP Images/Getty Images Host James Corden is making waves in late night as the host everyone was nervous about, but now everyone loves. His Carpool Karaoke segments are an Internet sensation, ensuring new viewers all of the time. His show has a classic BBC flavor and is somewhat fresh and new for U.S. audience. And as an accomplished performer, too, you can expect his net worth to climb as well.\n\n10 of 13 Chris Hardwick: $10 Million Tim Mosenfelder / Getty Images It's the after-show that everyone watches, and The Talking Dead's host, Chris Hardwick, rounds out our Top 10. Hardwick's net worth clocks in at $10 million, a combination of his AMC talk show as well as a successful comedy game show, of sorts, on Comedy Central, called @midnight.\n\n11 of 13 Bonus Former Host: David Letterman: $400 Million Theo Wargo/Getty Images The king of late night, David Letterman, former host of the Late Show with David Letterman, still carries a net worth of $400 million, though his salary has dipped to $20 million a year. Letterman's cash comes from his production company, Worldwide Pants, and real estate investments.\n\n12 of 13 Bonus Former Host: Jay Leno: $350 Million John Lamparski/WireImage/Getty Images Former Tonight Show host Jay Leno has a net worth of $350 million and an annual salary of about $15 million. Leno collects his extra cash through an extensive line-up of stand-up shows across the country and a couple of new TV gigs."""

HERE IT IS:\n\nYeah, we\'re obsessed.\n\nHarry also spoke to Nick for two hours (TWO HOURS) about everything from what Adele gave him for his birthday to his \'weird\' and \'wrong\' approach to dating.\n\nOn the topic of his forthcoming album, Harry said he was nervous about the reaction it would receive, but also incredibly proud of it. He commented:\n\n""It\xe2\x80\x99s a bit weird, I feel like I\xe2\x80\x99ve been hibernating for so long now and you hear it in the safety of the studio and now it\xe2\x80\x99s time to give birth \xe2\x80\xa6 it\xe2\x80\x99s the song (debut single) I\xe2\x80\x99m most proud of writing.\n\n""In the least weird way possible, it\xe2\x80\x99s my favourite album to listen to at the moment\xe2\x80\xa6 I think if you put out something that you don\xe2\x80\x99t stand behind and really love\xe2\x80\xa6then if it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t go well then you could regret not doing what you wanted to do. Whereas if nothing happens with it, I love it you know so I think that\xe2\x80\x99s what you should do.""\n\nOn what inspired the album, Harry added:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think a lot of people, especially at labels separate it because they work in music that it\xe2\x80\x99s a broader understanding of music than people who are listening\xe2\x80\xa6 I think we are all fans of music and I think we made it as the fan\xe2\x80\xa6 I hope we did a good job but I really like the album so I hope people like it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nYou go, Glen Coco.\n\nDusty Baxter-Wright Senior Entertainment & Lifestyle Writer Dusty Baxter-Wright is Cosmopolitan\'s Senior Entertainment and Lifestyle Writer, covering celebrities, movies, TV and books as well as travel, interiors, food and drink on a daily basis.\n\nThis content is created and maintained by a third party, and imported onto this page to help users provide their email addresses.

"b'English fashion designer and singer\n\nVictoria Caroline Beckham (n\xc3\xa9e Adams; born 17 April 1974)[1][2] is an English singer, fashion designer and television personality. She rose to prominence in the 1990s as a member of the girl group the Spice Girls, in which she was nicknamed Posh Spice. With over 85 million records sold worldwide, the group became the best-selling female group of all time.[3][4] After the Spice Girls split in 2001, Beckham was signed to Virgin Records, in which she released her self-titled debut solo album, which produced two UK Top 10 singles.\n\nBeckham has starred in five official documentaries and reality shows, including Victoria\'s Secrets (2000), Being Victoria Beckham (2002), The Real Beckhams (2003), Victoria Beckham - A Mile In Their Shoes (2004), and Victoria Beckham: Coming to America (2007), She has since made a cameo appearance in an episode of Ugly Betty (2007), and been a guest judge on Project Runway (2008), Germany\'s Next Topmodel (2009), and American Idol (2010).\n\nBeckham has become an internationally recognised style icon and fashion designer. Following high-profile collaborations with other brands, she launched an eponymous label in 2008, and a lower-priced (diffusion) label in 2011. The Victoria Beckham label was named designer brand of the year in the UK in 2011; in 2012 the brand was assessed as the star performer in the Beckham family\'s business interests.[5][6] Writing in the Daily Telegraph in 2011, Belinda White noted that the transition from WAG to fashion designer had been more successful than most had predicted, saying: ""She has gathered a significant celebrity following and won over the scathing fashion pack who now clamour for a ticket to her bi-annual show at New York Fashion Week.""[7] Beckham was appointed an OBE in the 2017 New Year Honours for services to the fashion industry. She is married to David Beckham, and they have four children, including Brooklyn. As of May 2019, the couple\'s joint wealth is estimated at \xc2\xa3355 million.[8]\n\nEarly life\n\nBeckham was born at the Princess Alexandra Hospital in Harlow, Essex, United Kingdom, and raised in Goffs Oak, Hertfordshire.[9] She is the eldest of three children of Jacqueline Doreen (n\xc3\xa9e Cannon), a former insurance clerk and hairdresser,[10] and Anthony William Adams, who worked as an electronics engineer.[9] They founded an electronics wholesale business which allowed a comfortable upbringing for Victoria, her sister, Louise,[1] and her brother, Christian Adams.[11] Beckham\'s great-great-great-grandfather was German artist and revolutionary Carl Heinrich Pf\xc3\xa4nder [de] and great-great granduncle was Minnesota politician William Pfaender.[12][13]\n\nAfter watching the musical film Fame in 1980, she decided to pursue a musical career.[1][14] Jacqueline and Anthony Adams enrolled her at Jason Theatre School.[1] In 1991, Beckham entered Laine Theatre Arts in Epsom, Surrey and studied dance and modelling.[1][2] Beckham attended St. Mary\'s High School in Cheshunt, where she was embarrassed by her family\'s wealth and often begged her father not to drop her off outside the school in their Rolls Royce.[15] Eventually, she became a member of a band called Persuasion.[16]\n\nMusic career\n\n1994\xe2\x80\x932000: Spice Girls\n\nBeckham auditioned for a March 1994 advertisement in The Stage which required girls who were ""street smart, extrovert[ed], ambitious and able to sing and dance"".[9] In 1994, Beckham joined the all-female group, the Spice Girls. In the recordings before her marriage, she is credited with her maiden name as Victoria Adams. The group\'s first single was called ""Wannabe"" (1996), and she worked alongside Geri Halliwell, Emma Bunton, Melanie Brown and Melanie Chisholm. It went to number one in the United Kingdom and United States, and another 35 countries. It was followed by eight further number one singles from their albums Spice, Spiceworld and Forever.[2] Each member of the group received a nickname from the media and Beckham was named ""Posh Spice"".[17][18] The group is the best-selling female group of all time, selling over 80 million records worldwide.[19][20] After the release of their third album, Forever, which charted at number two in the UK but was far less successful than their previous two albums, the Spice Girls stopped recording, concentrating on their solo careers in regards to their foreseeable future.[21]\n\n2000\xe2\x80\x932002: Victoria Beckham\n\nOn 14 August 2000, Beckham released her first solo single, ""Out of Your Mind"" in collaboration with Dane Bowers and Truesteppers.[9] The week of release coincided with the release of ""Groovejet (If This Ain\'t Love)"" by Spiller featuring Sophie Ellis-Bextor, resulting in a chart battle dubbed \'Posh vs. Posher\' by the tabloids.[22] Before the single\'s release, on 8 July 2000, Beckham made her public solo debut at London\'s Hyde Park at a concert to raise money for the Prince\'s Trust charity. She sang ""Out of Your Mind"" to a 100,000-strong audience.[23] Beckham then signed a recording contract with her group label Virgin Records.[2] Her next single as a solo artist, ""Not Such An Innocent Girl"", was released on 17 September 2001.[24] Again, she faced competition in another hugely hyped chart battle, this time with Kylie Minogue\'s single ""Can\'t Get You Out of My Head"".[25] Despite a huge promotional campaign, Beckham was outsold eight to one, and her single debuted at number 6.[26] Beckham\'s eponymous debut album, which was released on 1 October 2001, reached Number 10 in the UK album chart.[27] The album cost a reputed \xc2\xa35 million to produce and it sold a modest 50,000 copies.[28]\n\nThe second and final single to be released from the album was ""A Mind of Its Own"" on 11 February 2002. The single reached number 6 in the UK[29] and sold 56,500 copies.[30] Rumours soon spread that Beckham was to be dropped by her label for not charting in the Top Three. These were strongly refuted at the time.[31] Beckham commented ""You know what newspapers are like, they just like to put all the negative stuff in, but as far as I\'m concerned and the record company is concerned it is all great.""[31] A third single, ""I Wish"", was promoted but never materialised. The single version was a remix featuring Robbie Craig, and was performed on TV on Friday Night\'s All Wright.[32] Following the announcement of Beckham\'s second pregnancy, the single was shelved. Beckham was reportedly dropped by Virgin Records along with fellow Spice Girls Emma Bunton and Melanie B,;[33][34] but a statement from her publicist denied reports, stating: ""No-one has been dropped. The Virgin deal has come to a natural end and both parties have decided not to continue.""[33][35]\n\n2002\xe2\x80\x932004: Unreleased albums and final solo releases\n\nIn 2002, Beckham signed a contract with Telstar Records and 19 Management[28] worth \xc2\xa31.5 million.[2] In 2003, she began recording an electropop-influenced album, Open Your Eyes and chose ""Let Your Head Go"" as first single.[36] When the album was finalized, Beckham was disappointed with the result and decided to return to the studio to record a new material.[37] She wanted a more urban sound and worked with the producer Damon Dash to work on the R&B and hip hop influenced album Come Together.[28][29] When Dash was first asked why he recorded with Beckham, he stated: ""Because I see how much she gets photographed over here.""[2] A Dash-produced track ""It\'s That Simple"" featuring M.O.P. premiered on radio stations in July 2003 as promotional single,[29] generating mixed reviews.[29] Beckham\'s first single with Telstar, the double A-side ""Let Your Head Go"" / ""This Groove"",[29] was released in the UK on 29 December 2003, following heavy promotion and many TV appearances across the Christmas period with the video being directed by Andy Hylton. The single charted at number three in the UK.[29]\n\nThe double A-side was a thermometer to Beckham \xe2\x80\x93 if ""Let Your Head Go"" was more successful, she would release the electropop-inspired album Open Your Eyes, but if ""This Groove"" was better rated, she would release the R&B album Come Together.[29] Outside of the UK, Damon Dash had plans for she in the US, including a potential release of ""This Groove"", and believed that Beckham would be successful because R&B was up in the world and her music style was similar to Jennifer Lopez.[38] With the financial problems of the record company, combined with a rumoured fall-out between Dash and Fuller and the UK media massacring Beckham\'s solo career, the release of any album was postponed.[24][39] Beckham\'s final plan at a solo career was the announcement of a new single, ""My Love Is for Real"", slated for a Summer 2004 release. But in April 2004, Telstar announced bankruptcy and Beckham gave up music to focus on her fashion career.[40] In 2007 a new song, the hip-hop inspired ""Full Stop"", featuring the rapper Nas, was leaked on American radios and the media reported that Beckman would release it as a single, but nothing happened.[41]\n\n2007\xe2\x80\x932012: Return of the Spice Girls\n\nBeckham performing with the Spice Girls in Las Vegas in December 2007\n\nIn 2007, the Spice Girls reformed and announced plans to embark upon a reunion tour,[42] from which they were said to have earned \xc2\xa310 million each (approximately $20 million).[43] Beckham had previously stated that she and her former Spice colleagues were enjoying their solo careers in various fields, saying ""We\'re all still doing our own thing.""[44] Their Greatest Hits album was released in early November 2007 and the tour began on 2 December 2007. At its advent, Beckham said ""I wanted my children to see that Mummy was a pop star. It was the last opportunity for them to stand in a crowd full of people screaming for the Spice Girls.""[45] When Beckham had her hair coloured brown for the tour, she stated that her sons immediately reacted by saying ""Oh my goodness, it\'s Posh Spice. She\'s back.""[46] She was the only member of the group not to sing a solo song on the tour, instead posing in the style of a fashion show on a makeshift catwalk, whereas the others each performed a number from their solo careers.[47]\n\nFilm-maker Bob Smeaton directed an official film of the tour titled Spice Girls: Giving You Everything, which was first aired on Fox8 in Australia. It later aired in the UK on 31 December 2007 on BBC One.[48] As well as their sell-out tour, the Spice Girls were contracted to appear in Tesco advertisements, for which they were paid \xc2\xa31 million each.[49]\n\nIn October 2009, reports suggested that the Spice Girls were to star in a reality show in which they would cast female actors to play their roles in a musical.[50] The following year, Judy Craymer teamed up with the Spice Girls and Simon Fuller to start developing a Spice Girls musical titled Viva Forever!. On 26 June 2012, all five Spice Girls were in attendance at a press conference in London to promote the launch of Viva Forever![51] The musical opened at the West End\'s Piccadilly Theatre on 11 December 2012.[51] On 12 August 2012, after much speculation, Beckham and the Spice Girls performed a medley of ""Wannabe"" and ""Spice Up Your Life"" at the 2012 Summer Olympics closing ceremony, reuniting solely for the event.[52] Their performance was the most tweeted moment of Olympics closing ceremony with over 116,000 tweets on Twitter per minute.[53]\n\nThe band reunited again for a 2019 tour, however Beckham opted not to participate in the reunion choosing to focus on her fashion label instead.[54] When the American television presenter Ellen DeGeneres asked her why she chose not to join with the other Spice Girls for the reunion tour, she said ""It just didn\'t feel like the right thing to do. [But] I\'ll always be Posh Spice, always.""[55]\n\nFashion\n\nBeckham made a guest appearance on the catwalk for Maria Grachvogel on 17 February 2000, marking her debut as a model at London Fashion Week.[56] Beckham also acted as a British ambassador for Dolce and Gabbana[57] and was briefly the face of Rocawear in 2003.[58] Beckham designed a limited-edition fashion line for Rock & Republic called VB Rocks in 2004, consisting mainly of jeans for the high end of the market, retailing at approximately $300 in the US.[59]\n\nOn 16 January 2006, Beckham walked the runway for Roberto Cavalli at Milan Fashion Week, and was for a period exclusively dressed by him for red-carpet and social events.[60] For the March 2006 issue of Harper\'s Bazaar, Beckham acted as fashion editor when she styled her close friend, Katie Holmes, for a fashion shoot.[61] She has admitted to a personal love of sunglasses, saying ""I\'m quite obsessed with sunglasses. I collect vintage Guccis and Carreras \xe2\x80\x93 they can make virtually any outfit look cool.""[14] After Beckham\'s departure from Rock & Republic, in September 2006, she furthered her fashion ventures by launching her own denim label, dvb Style.[59][62] Beckham then launched a new official website, dvbstyle.com to promote her fashion work.[63]\n\nOn 14 June 2007, Beckham launched dvb Denim collection in New York at Saks Fifth Avenue, along with unveiling her eyewear range in the United States for the first time.[64] In the same month, Beckham made her first appearance at London\'s annual Graduate Fashion Week as a judge alongside Glenda Bailey (editor-in-chief of Harper\'s Bazaar) and Lanvin\'s Alber Elbaz, to choose the winner of the River Island Gold Award, worth \xc2\xa320,000.[65] In August 2007, Intimately Beckham perfume was launched into US stores, one of more than 20 perfumes she and David Beckham have introduced over the years.[66][67] In September 2007 her cosmetics line V-Sculpt was launched in Tokyo.[68] In a 2007 appearance at an LA Galaxy press conference, Beckham is credited with having popularised Roland Mouret\'s \'moon dress\' and his brand,[69] and Beckham was also the face of Marc Jacobs for his Spring 2008 collection.[70]\n\nBeckham has graced countless fashion magazine covers during her career, including I-D in 2004 and W in 2007.[71] Her first Vogue appearance was the April 2008 British edition. This was followed by Vogue India, Vogue Paris as well as the German, Russian, Australian, Turkish, Taiwanese, Chinese and Spanish editions.[72] Beckham has also graced various international editions of Harper\'s Bazaar and Elle.\n\nOn 17 July 2018, Victoria\'s collection of her Reebok collaboration was launched.[73]\n\nLaunch of fashion label\n\nBeckham\'s eponymous label was launched in September 2008 in a low-key presentation.[74] By 2011, it had grown into a fixture of New York Fashion Week and a lower-priced Victoria by Victoria Beckham label was introduced. In the first quarter of 2011\xe2\x80\x9312, it was predicted to generate annual sales of more than \xc2\xa360 million.[7][75] Known initially for its dresses, the range has expanded into separates and luxury handbags selling at up to \xc2\xa318,000. Alongside the main fashion line and diffusion range, the Victoria Beckham brand still includes separate denim, eyewear and fragrance lines.[7] In November 2011, Victoria Beckham won Designer Brand of the Year at the British Fashion Awards.[5]\n\nIn September 2012, Victoria Beckham was the most talked about designer on Twitter during New York Fashion Week, also acquiring 57,000 new followers during the shows according to research by The Whispr Group.[76]\n\nWriting in The Independent in February 2014, Alexander Fury described how Victoria Beckham had made the transition from novelty to respected designer, citing her recent guest editorship of French Vogue and forthcoming participation in a panel discussion with the dean of Parsons design school in New York. The article concluded that the brand\'s sales were down to the appeal of the designs themselves, not the celebrity association.[77]\n\nIn 2017, Beckham\'s new collection for Target is including a wide range of sizes from XS to 3X for women. Beckham is also offering a new line for children\'s wear.[78]\n\nIn 2018 the collection was presented at London Fashion Week instead of at New York Fashion Week as normal.[79]\n\nIn 2019, a spokesperson for the brand confirmed that the line would remain fur-free, and announced that as of the autumn/winter collection, it would also be free of any exotic skins.[80]\n\nBusiness difficulties\n\nDespite her high social profile, her fashion brand has not been a business success. In November 2019, the BBC reported that ""Victoria Beckham\'s fashion business has posted another annual loss as demand for the former Spice Girl\'s high end clothes ""plateaued"". Victoria Beckham Limited, which has not made a profit since it launched in 2008, reported a loss of \xc2\xa312.3m for 2018. Sales slipped 16% to \xc2\xa335m, amid weaker wholesale demand. Chairman Ralph Toledano said sales of clothing and accessories had levelled off after years of growth. ""The performance was in line with expectations, so we were not surprised. Our goal is to reach profitability as soon as possible,"" he told trade journal Business of Fashion. Mrs Beckham launched her label in 2008 with a collection of luxury dresses, and now sells fashion and accessories in more than 400 stores around the world."" [81]\n\nVictoria Beckham Beauty\n\nIn September 2019, Victoria launched a Beauty brand named ""Victoria Beckham Beauty"".[82] Victoria envisions it as, ""We seek out brands that both fuel and sustain us. This is the heart of #VictoriaBeckhamBeauty. A brand created by two women who are as interested in the best beauty products as they are in wellness solutions for themselves, their friends and families and the world they live in. We aim high and will continue to chase the best for ourselves and our community."" Along with co-founder Sarah Creal, She showcased the brand at the London Fashion Week. Secondary packaging of the makeup is made from 100% post-consumer waste, while shipping materials are either recyclable or biodegradable. Victoria mentions it to be \xe2\x80\x9cactive and effective, but clean and kind.\xe2\x80\x9d[83][84]\n\nFirst installment of Victoria Beckham Beauty is centered around eye makeup which includes ""Satin Kajal Liner"" and it comes in three shades (Black, Bronze and Bordeaux).[85] ""Lid Lustre"" crystal-infused eye shadow in four shades.[86] Four ""Smoky Eye Brick"", each containing four different eye shadow shades (Onyx, Blonde, Min and Midnight) within a different color palette.[87][88][89]\n\nIn October 2019, Victoria Beckham has branched out into lip products with her ""Your Perfect Pout"" lip kit. Includes Bitten Lip Tint in Bisou and six vitamin E-infused, waterproof Lip Definer pencils in a variety of nude hues to suit a range of skin tones. The six nude hues include No. 01 (a pale peach); No. 02 (a neutral beige brown); No. 03 (a pink-y mauve); No. 04 (a rosy brown); No. 05 (a rich caramel); and No. 06 (a deep chestnut).[90]\n\nTelevision\n\nBeckham in D\xc3\xbcsseldorf promoting her new jeans in October 2008\n\nBeckham has shot five official documentaries. The first, dated 11 January 2000, was called Victoria\'s Secrets, a programme only shown in the UK on Channel 4. It involved Beckham being followed by cameras while also discussing and interviewing other British celebrities, such as Elton John.[91] The second, Being Victoria Beckham, was broadcast in March 2002 and saw Beckham discussing her career as a solo artist with the release of her first album, and also showed her at various photo shoots and recording sessions. The documentary attracted a strong audience of 8.83 million,[92] coming top in its timeslot.[93] One critic described her as ""so clearly level-headed, happy with her not inconsiderable lot and seemingly unfazed by the madly intrusive nature of her monumentally ridiculous fame"".[94] The third, The Real Beckhams, aired on 24 December 2003 on ITV1 and focused on the Beckhams\' move to Madrid from London after David Beckham was signed to Real Madrid. It also featured Victoria Beckham re-launching her solo career and showed her mocking the tabloid stories she reads in the paper every day. The special received an audience of 6.10 million viewers[95] and was later released on DVD on 2 February 2004.[96]\n\nThe fourth was titled Full Length & Fabulous: The Beckhams\' 2006 World Cup Party, and followed Victoria and David Beckham organising and making preparations to host a 2006 World Cup Party at a marquee in the grounds of their mansion in Hertfordshire, which aimed to raise money for their charity.[97] Two tickets to attend the ball were auctioned on-line for charity, and sold for \xc2\xa3103,000.[98] The documentary aired on 28 May 2006 and showed the event itself, where the menu was designed especially by friend and chef Gordon Ramsay and the charity auction was hosted by Graham Norton.[99] Ramsay catered for 600 guests, with the aid of 40 chefs and 100 waiting staff.[99] The ITV documentary attracted an average of 7.56 million viewers.[100]\n\nTo document Victoria Beckham\'s preparations for her family\'s move to the US, she signed a deal with NBC for six episodes of a half-hour unscripted reality TV series. Despite original plans for six episodes, the show was cut to a one-hour special only as there ""just wasn\'t enough (material) for a series.""[101] The show, called Victoria Beckham: Coming to America, aired on 16 July 2007 in the US and Canada. It was heavily scrutinised by the American media and critics, with The New York Post describing it as ""an orgy of self-indulgence"" and also describing Beckham as ""vapid and condescending"".[101] The programme was the third-most-watched programme in its time-slot and received viewing figures of 4.9 million in the US, beaten by a repeat of Wife Swap and two sitcoms. The programme aired in Britain on 17 July 2007 on ITV with 3.84 million viewers tuning in.[102] The programme was produced by Simon Fuller who managed her and the Spice Girls on their come-back tour.[103]\n\nIn July 2007, it was announced that Beckham would shortly begin filming a cameo appearance as herself in an episode of the second season of ABC\'s TV series Ugly Betty.[104] The episode, ""A Nice Day for a Posh Wedding"", aired on 9 November 2007 in the United States and on 23 November in the United Kingdom. Despite her forays into television, Beckham has denied plans to embark upon a Hollywood movie career.[105] In February 2008, it was revealed that Beckham would be the guest judge for the finale of fourth season of Project Runway, which aired on 5 March 2008 in the US.[106]\n\nIt was reported in October 2007 that Beckham had turned down the opportunity to appear in Sex and the City: The Movie. She stated in an interview: ""[I was] asked to be in the Sex and the City film, which I would have loved to have done, but because I am in full-on Spice Girls rehearsal mode, unfortunately, I can\'t do it.""[107]\n\nBooks\n\nOn 13 September 2001, Beckham released her first book, Learning to Fly.[108] The title was taken from a line in a song from the musical Fame, which Beckham had enjoyed as a child. The verse that inspired the title was: ""I\'m gonna live forever, I\'m gonna learn how to fly"".[109] The autobiography documents her childhood, time during the Spice Girls, her marriage and family life, as well as her career at the time.[110] She describes her eating disorder associated with the need to be slim.[citation needed] Learning to Fly became the third best-selling non-fiction title of 2001 and the total UK sales stand at more than 500,000 copies.[111] When the book was first released, it went to Number 1 in the book charts after four weeks of release, relegating Robbie Williams\' book to second place.[26] A high-profile guest appearance on Parkinson, watched by nine million people, helped to promote the book.[26] Hello!, Daily Mail and The Mail on Sunday joined to buy the rights to preview and serialise the book before its publication. The figure paid was thought to be near \xc2\xa31 million.[16]\n\nBeckham was quoted by a Spanish journalist in 2005 as saying: ""I\'ve never read a book in my life"".[112] She later explained this was a mistranslation from the original Spanish in which the interview was printed, saying she actually stated that she never had time to finish reading a book because she was always too busy looking after her children.[113]\n\nBeckham\'s second book, a fashion advice guide titled That Extra Half an Inch: Hair, Heels and Everything in Between, was published on 27 October 2006.[114] That Extra Half an Inch: Hair, Heels and Everything in Between includes tips from Beckham on fashion, style and beauty,[114] and also contains photography by Mario Testino, Annie Leibovitz and Steven Meisel. The book became another best-seller,[115] and has sold 400,000 copies in Britain alone since it was published in hardcover.[62] The rights have since been sold to the United States, the Netherlands, Japan, Portugal, Lithuania, Russia, and most recently China.[62]\n\nPower and influence\n\nIn 2007, it was reported that Beckham was the 52nd richest woman in Britain[116] and the 19th richest person in Britain with husband David, with an estimated joint wealth of \xc2\xa3112 million ($225 million).[8] According to The Guardian, Beckham Ventures, a company linked to the Victoria Beckham fashion business, was the best performing brand in the family\'s three businesses in 2012, coming close to matching turnover in a sister company that promotes the David Beckham brand.[6]\n\nIn 2010, Beckhams\'s charity work with Save the Children earned her a nomination for the Do Something With Style Award, an awards show, produced by VH1.[117] She is a patron of the Elton John AIDS Foundation.[118] Beckham promotes faux/synthetic furs. Her stand against the fur industry generated praise from animal rights organisations, including PETA. Beckham has stated that she is ""supportive of its [PETA\'s] high-profile anti-fur campaigns,"" and pledged ""never to work with fur in any of her own fashion collections"".[119] In February 2013, she was assessed as one of the 100 most powerful women in the UK in the fashion category by Woman\'s Hour on BBC Radio 4.[120][121]\n\nIn 2014, Beckham joined the Ban Bossy campaign as a spokesperson advocating leadership roles for girls.[122][123][124]\n\nBeckham was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2017 New Year Honours for services to the fashion industry.[125] She stated she was ""delighted and humbled for the recognition,"" which her husband also received in 2003.[126] However, as recipients of honours are sworn to secrecy, and Beckham had announced her honour before the 2017 New Year Honours\' official publication, she was criticised for the ""betrayal of etiquette"" by the Conservative MP Peter Bone.[127]\n\nPersonal life\n\nBeckham with her husband David in Silverstone Circuit during the British Grand Prix in July 2007\n\nBeckham began a relationship with Corey Haim in 1995, which ended on mutual terms.[128]\n\nIn early 1997, she started dating footballer David Beckham after they met at a charity football match; prior to this he had watched her music videos and commented to teammates that he was attracted to her, but had been overcome with shyness when they were first introduced.[129][130] A few months earlier, Victoria had also expressed a wish to meet David during a Spice Girls football photo session (by chance, she wore the kit of his club Manchester United for the feature as the group\'s manager was a supporter).[131][132] Of their initial meeting, she said, ""I didn\'t really know who he was. I was never into football.""[129] The couple announced their engagement in 1998 and were dubbed ""Posh and Becks"" by the media.[133]\n\nShe collects handbags, and owns over 100 Birkin bags, made by Herm\xc3\xa8s, which are widely considered the most valuable and sought-after, including a \xc2\xa3100,000 shocking pink one, and worth a total of more than \xc2\xa31.5 million.[134]\n\nMarriage\n\nOn 4 July 1999 they were married by the Bishop of Cork, Paul Colton, at Luttrellstown Castle, Ireland.[135] The wedding attracted much media coverage.[136] Beckham\'s teammate, Gary Neville, was the best man,[130] and the couple\'s four-month-old son Brooklyn was the ring bearer.[137] Most of the media were kept away from the ceremony as an exclusive deal with OK! magazine had been arranged, but photographs were released showing the Beckhams sitting on golden thrones.[138] Victoria wore a diamond coronet created for her by jewellery designer Slim Barrett. A total of 437 staff were employed for the wedding reception, which was estimated to have cost \xc2\xa3500,000 (US$823,650).[135]\n\nThe couple bought what became their most famous home for \xc2\xa32.5 million in 1999;[139] the property, which is set in 24 acres (9.7 ha) of land, was given a \xc2\xa33 million renovation and was subsequently dubbed Beckingham Palace by the media.[139]\n\nChildren\n\nVictoria and David Beckham have four children: son Brooklyn Joseph (born 4 March 1999),[140] son Romeo James (born 1 September 2002),[141] son Cruz David (born 20 February 2005),[142] and daughter Harper Seven (born 10 July 2011).[143] Elton John and David Furnish are reportedly the godparents of Brooklyn and another son, and their godmother is Elizabeth Hurley.[144]\n\nAlleged kidnap and death threats\n\nIn January 2000, a tip-off to Scotland Yard detectives exposed a plot to kidnap Victoria and Brooklyn Beckham and hold them at a house in Hampstead, London. The family was then moved to a secret location, but no arrests were made.[145] In March of that year, she received a death threat prior to performing at the Brit Awards with the Spice Girls, and at the show\'s rehearsal, a red laser light appeared on her chest and she was rushed off stage. After a fire door was found to be lodged open, it was thought that there had been an assassin there, and Beckham later revealed that she was terrified by the experience.[145] In November 2002, five people were arrested after another plot for her kidnap was infiltrated by a tabloid newspaper.[146] All charges were dropped after a witness was deemed unreliable.[147]\n\nFilmography\n\nDiscography\n\nSee also'"
"b""How E! Is Remaking the People's Choice Awards for 2018\n\nBrass at the cable giant hope a cross-portfolio push will bring an optimistic finish to an inarguably rough year for televised kudos.\n\nAwards shows may still be among TV\xe2\x80\x99s surest bets to lure a live audience, but fraught licensing negotiations and flagging ratings are dulling the sheen. A unique solution to those problems, however, is to skip the middleman altogether and buy one at a fire sale.\n\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s what E! did in April of 2017, when Proctor & Gamble unloaded the People\xe2\x80\x99s Choice Awards with the last of its TV properties. The 43-year-old populist celebration debuts at its new network with a new owner (NBCUniversal) on Nov. 11. Brass at the cable giant hope the unconventional move (and a cross-portfolio push) will bring an optimistic finish to an inarguably rough year for televised kudos.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a year that went by that someone didn\xe2\x80\x99t come in with a pitch for an original awards show,\xe2\x80\x9d says E! president Adam Stotsky, who long sought a tentpole event for his brand synonymous with red carpet coverage. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd when the rights for some of the smaller shows came up, it never made sense.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNBCUniversal\xe2\x80\x99s purchase, which is said to have set the company back a modest $8 million to $10 million, gives E! freedom to change the show to suit the celebrity-centric outlet without losing any of the built-in brand recognition. This year's event will be produced by Wilshire Studios and Den of Thieves with exec producers Jesse Ignjatovic and Evan Prager. (For its final five years on CBS, the show averaged 8.2 million viewers and a 1.9 rating among adults 18-49 \xe2\x80\x94 numbers any cable network would salivate over.)\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis show fits in perfectly with what [NBCUniversal CEO] Steve Burke says about owning not renting,\xe2\x80\x9d says network EP of live events Jen Neal. Also E!'s executive vp marketing, Neal points to the social footprint of nominees as a major assist in getting the word out. Deadpool star Ryan Reynolds, The Avengers\xe2\x80\x99 Chris Hemsworth and resident E! shills the Kardashians have been among the more vocal promoters thus far.\n\nTo be sure, 2018 has not been pretty for glitzy Hollywood telecasts. The main shows (the Emmys, Oscars, Globes and Grammys) lost a combined 15 million viewers from their year-ago telecasts. Concerns over that downward trajectory stalled deal renewals for both the Globes at NBC and the Emmys with the Big Four. NBCUniversal anticipates a calendar shift for People\xe2\x80\x99s Choice, which traditionally aired in the middle of awards season, might help buck that trend \xe2\x80\x94 as could the decision to air it simultaneously on sister networks Syfy, USA, Bravo and NBC Universo, in addition to E!'s 160 international territories.\n\nAt least four marquee advertisers have been secured since the parent company's decision to make the show a point of emphasis during its Rockefeller Center pitch to media buyers in May. And, even if it's a flop, the fact that NBCUniversal now owns People's Choice in perpetuity offers a rare cushion in the awards space.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve built a huge business out of filming people walking through a parking lot, but we\xe2\x80\x99ve never gone in the building,\xe2\x80\x9d adds Stotsky. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is already a win for us.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThis story appears in the Oct. 30 issue of The Hollywood Reporter magazine.

"b'Stephen Belafonte today breaks his silence over the bitter divorce with Spice Girl Mel B, tears down \'utterly false\' accusations of domestic violence and challenges the truth behind her damning book Brutally Honest.\n\nBranding the America\'s Got Talent judge a \'narcissistic liar,\' he claims she systematically tried to \'annihilate\' every aspect of his character with a catalog of \'horrific\' lies.\n\nBelafonte insists Mel and her legal team \'concocted\' a cynical plan to drag his name through the mud in a bid to gain a \'tactical advantage\' in the divorce proceedings, despite having \'zero proof.\'\n\nAnd he says he has been left heartbroken after losing the right to see his step-daughter Angel, 11, who he helped raise from birth, while also being upset that all his children can now read about his and Mel\'s \'dirty\' and \'messy\' divorce because of his former wife\'s actions.\n\nSpeaking exclusively to DailyMailTV in Beverly Hills, Belafonte, 43, said: \'It was dirty. Melanie came out of the gate with such horrific tall tales - it\'s probably the worst divorce that\'s ever played out in the media, it was very messy.\n\nHis side of the story: Stephen Belafonte has broken his silence over his very public and \'dirty\' divorce from Mel B, in an exclusive interview with DailyMailTV\n\nHappier times: Belafonte and Mel B, who were married for ten years before splitting last year, have endured a messy divorce involving claims of domestic abuse, cheating, threesomes, and a bitter custody battle (pictured in 2012)\n\n\'She said horrifically bizarre things - that I beat her, I ran a pornography company, I was a sex trafficker, I beat our dog, random things to garner some attention.\n\n\'I could not stop what Melanie started. She made these allegations to get a tactical advantage. She wanted everything, all the money and full custody of Madison.\n\n\'She knows when she goes out and makes these allegations, they\'re going to go everywhere, she did it purposefully. She did it to try to bash me so I would have to take her deal.\n\n\'But she doesn\'t understand one thing about me - I could lose it all, but I\'m never gonna lose my daughter. When she took her away I just had to work harder to get her back.\'\n\nDefiant Belafonte, dressed casually in ripped jeans and a white dress shirt, decided to speak out as Mel\'s new book Brutally Honest hit the shelves Tuesday.\n\nThe main theme of the explosive memoir is the star\'s roller coaster ten-year marriage with her ex.\n\nMel, 43, accuses Belafonte of years of emotional and physical abuse, driving her to the brink.\n\nBut Belafonte calls out the book as all \'lies\' and challenges his ex to produce a single bit of evidence to prove he was violent or abusive.\n\nHe doubles down on the challenge by vowing to give his ex wife his share of their $7million marital home - IF she can produce a shred of evidence.\n\nHe references the night of December 14, 2014, days before Mel appeared at the UK X Factor grand final with what appeared to be marks or bruises on her body.\n\nHe explained: \'She has said I put her in the hospital and I beat her so bad that she was in there for six or seven days. That\'s an open and shut case. You show the hospital records, the judge says wow and then I am the scumbag that she says I am because she has the proof.\n\n\'But what she did was very tricky. She made all these allegations and then she won\'t show the hospital records.\'\n\nBelafonte has slammed the \'utterly false\' accusations of domestic violence and challenges the truth behind Mel\'s new book Brutally Honest, due in stores Tuesday, November 27. Above she is pictured wearing a silver glittering \'I Am Not Sorry I Am Not For Sale\' dress during her book launch in London\n\nThe 43-year-old claims his ex-wife \'manufactured\' a whole life of abuse for 10 years with \'no proof\' in order gain \'tactical advantage\' in their divorce. Above she is pictured with a bandage on her face, which she initially claimed was for a scrape she suffered from a fall\n\nMel tweeted a photo of her injury in 2012 , but later alleged in 2017 that her scrape was from Belafonte punching her with a closed fist and pushing her down on the carpet\n\nBelafonte said Mel\'s legal team fended off several exhaustive requests from his lawyers to see the records, citing HIPPA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) laws.\n\n\'The judge can\'t even compel her to do it,\' he said. \'So what she does is makes the allegations and then pulls back.\n\n\'But I stand behind it 100 million percent. I would give my interest in the house to be sold 100 percent to Melanie - show the hospital records.\'\n\nHe added firmly: \'She can\'t show them because Melanie went into the hospital that day (Dec 14, 2014) for a drug overdose.\n\n\'Melanie has covered up her drug addiction time and time again and throwing me under the bus is kind of the way that she\'s done it.\'\n\nIn Brutally Honest, Mel admits to being hospitalized after overdosing on 200 aspirins in a failed suicide bid on that 2014 date.\n\nShe also admitted to abusing alcohol and cocaine, drinking heavily and snorting six or seven lines of the white powder before her X Factor appearances.\n\nBelafonte reveals he is already planning to sue for defamation\n\nBelafonte adds that in the book, while Mel regularly alludes to violence, she does not include details of several beatings she alleged she received from her ex in court papers during their bitter divorce last year.\n\nIn court documents filed in a bid to win a temporary domestic violence restraining order against Belafonte, Mel branded her ex a \'monster\' and told a horrific story of abuse.\n\nShe claimed he tried to choke her and threw her to the ground during one rage in November, 2007, the night of her \'Dancing with the Stars\' finale, she alleged Belafonte \'punched her and split her lip\' after becoming jealous while she filmed a segment with Usher for the X Factor back in 2012 and in August the same year, the day after performing at the closing ceremonies for the London Olympics, she alleged Belafonte punched her with a closed fist and pushed her down on the carpet.\n\nHer skin was burned and her face \'actually scabbed over the rug burns,\' she claimed.\n\nYet despite this apparent \'pattern\' of violence not a single one of these allegations is included in the memoir.\n\nBelafonte says the former couple do NOT have a non-disclosure agreement -meaning there\'s nothing to stop Mel from telling all.\n\nRegardless, he is already planning to sue the singer for defamation of character over many of the false claims he says she\'s made in the book.\n\n\'She claimed some horrific, horrific things.\'\n\nSo, he says, his question to Melanie is, why didn\'t she include what was in her initial deposition now.\n\n\'I don\'t know why she\'s not telling the world of all the things that she filed (in her deposition). That is very confusing.\'\n\nThe businessman and movie producer says the past two years have been extremely stressful.\n\nAnd while he admits he feels vindicated by the courts, he is still upset he wasn\'t able to show the mountain of evidence he had compiled proving Mel was lying about him.\n\nHe claims to have submitted more than 3,000 exhibits of evidence to the court including text messages, emails, audio recordings and videos.\n\n\'I\'m not interested in my version against her version,\' he explained. \'I\'m just interested in the facts presented in court, that Melanie buried.\n\nThe producer said he\'s been left heartbroken after losing the right to see his step-daughter Angel (right) 11, who he helped raise from birth. He fought in vain to get court-ordered step-parent visitation rights\n\nBelafonte, pictured with step-daughter and daughter, has not seen Angel who he says he raised from birth \'until she was ripped from me with no explanation\'\n\nBelafonte took to Instagram earlier this year doting on his step-daughter Angel of who he has since lost custody\n\n\'She\'s manufactured this whole life of abuse for 10 years with no proof, zero proof.\n\n\'We submitted thousands of emails and text messages that contradicted everything that Melanie said, but the whole world never got to see that.\'\n\nThe warring couple settled the case out of court.\n\nNevertheless, Belafonte claims Mel changed her story repeatedly during the court case, and the domestic violence restraining order was dismissed the day before the trial after they came to a private settlement.\n\nAccording to Belafonte, she gagged their former nanny Lorraine Gilles by paying her off.\n\nMel had been forced to admit she had had a five-year lesbian affair with German-born Gilles despite initially telling the court it was her husband who had the affair and the pair plotted against her.\n\nBelafonte claims Mel paid Lorraine off and settled our case a day before the trial to bury all the evidence in the deposition, \'so the world didn\'t get to know the real Melanie Brown.\'\n\nYou\'re not going to scare me into a bunch of lies. There was no truth. If there was any truth to it, maybe she would have had a point, but it was 100% fabricated to gain a tactical advantage.\n\nBelafonte admits that he was in love with Mel at the beginning of their relationship having met in 2007 and says they were best friends.\n\n\'We very much were in love, we had a lot of amazing times and for some reason, you know, she came out with all of these false allegations,\' he said.\n\n\'After 10 years of our marriage, when we decided to get divorced, it was a mutual decision.\n\n\'Her drinking and cocaine use were out of control and I couldn\'t take it anymore.\n\n\'But we were still texting each other, we still saw each other, I was seeing the kids.\'\n\nBut unbeknownst to Belafonte, Mel had other plans.\n\nShe secretly hired high-powered divorce attorneys Larry Bakman and Susan Wiesner and he claims she \'concocted\' an elaborate game plan to \'annihilate\' him.\n\nHe claims Mel called the ATF - Bureau of Alcohol, Firearms and Explosives - and alleged Belafonte was hiding guns in their home.\n\nSpeaking from Beverly Hills on day of the release of Mel\'s new book, Belafonte described the split as \'probably the worst divorce that\'s ever played out in the media\'\n\n\'Melanie showed up to my house with ATF, saying that I had guns, they raided my house, they didn\'t find anything,\' Belafonte recalls.\n\n\'My ex said she was scared that I had the guns hiding somewhere else.\n\n\'So she was able to get an immediate move out (notice) on me.\'\n\nATF agents raided the couple\'s Hollywood Hills house on March 31 looking for firearms and on April 3, Mel secured a temporary restraining order and move out order against her ex, which required that Belafonte steer clear of her, her three children and their house. The restraining order was never made permanent.\n\nBelafonte said his world suddenly crumbled around him.\n\nHe was homeless, wasn\'t able to see his daughters and video of federal agents swarming around him looking for his guns flashed around the world.\n\nThings would only get worse.\n\n\'I couldn\'t see my daughter for eight months, my ex said that I was going to take a knife and physically stab her. I lost a lot of friendships, I lost a lot of business,\' he recalls.\n\nBelafonte said he was \'dumbfounded\' by his wife\'s actions.\n\nHe said they had spoken to each other amicably at length about how they would split things up and share custody of the kids.\n\n\'All of our text messages and emails leading up to our separation were normal...it didn\'t make any sense,\' he said.\n\n\'Our whole game plan was to have a very smooth transition, where we lived semi-close to each other and the kids would still come over and everything was normal.\n\n\'We agreed that we would have our lawyers talk to each other about money, we didn\'t argue about any of it. It\'s crazy, it doesn\'t even make sense why she did this.\'\n\nThen it dawned on him.\n\nBelafonte claims Mel paid nanny Lorraine Gilles (center) off and settled the case a day before the trial to bury all the evidence in the deposition, \'so the world didn\'t get to know the real Melanie Brown\'\n\nThe messy proceedings forced Mel to admit she had had a five-year lesbian affair with German-born Gilles despite initially telling the court it was her husband who had the affair and the pair plotted against her\n\n\'Melanie and her lawyers contacted me and my lawyers and said, ""listen, if you give up any financial rights and you give up any rights in Madison we\'ll dismiss all of the allegations,""\' he claims.\n\n\'Remember, I never had a charge, I had allegations... she was going to dismiss all the allegations if I gave up my daughter and money.\n\n\'And that\'s never going to happen. You know, I\'m a father who would take ten bullets for my daughter.\n\n\'You\'re not going to scare me into a bunch of lies. There was no truth. If there was any truth to it, maybe she would have had a point, but it was 100% fabricated to gain a tactical advantage.\'\n\nBelafonte\'s attorney Grace Jamra, of Beverly Hills family law firm Jamra & Jamra, told DailyMailTV that Mel set out to \'destroy\' her client but Belafonte stood firm.\n\nShe said: \'The reality was that she tarnished his name, besmirched him, a man who stood by the principle of fighting for his child, ensuring her safety and of compromising what he otherwise would have been legally entitled to receive in funds. Stephen conceded a lot financially, not because he was guilty, but because he was sick of this and wanted it over.\n\n\'And so what she wanted to do was destroy him, for whatever reason, using her celebrity status. But the most important thing is that he could not be bought to get rid of his child and he could not be bought to cop to something he didn\'t do.\'\n\nYou\'d take a bullet for your child any day of the week, but Melanie keeps firing bullets and at the very end my daughters are going to read all of the negative things she\'s saying. So I had to. I was forced to come forward to talk to tell people what really happened\n\nBelafonte admits the former couple did occasionally have blazing rows during which they called each other names, but said: \'It wasn\'t a one sided thing that she\'s made the world think, that she was just at home shuttered in the house and that I was this big bad wolf.\'\n\nHe now realizes that he should have known Mel was capable of such a vicious attack.\n\n\'When she was with her first husband, (Jimmy Gulzar) she annihilated him afterwards and took complete control of Phoenix, when she was with Eddie Murphy, she got rid of Eddie Murphy and got complete custody of Angel.\n\n\'I didn\'t even rationalize it in our relationship that that could ever happen to me.\n\n\'And when we ended up separating, that\'s just what she wanted to do.\n\n\'She was going to bash me, make me give up all my parental rights and I\'m not going to do that.\'\n\nBelafonte is pragmatic about the future, however.\n\nHe was awarded half of the couple\'s money by a judge and says he been able to see daughter Madison most of the time.\n\n\'I don\'t want to go tell people I\'m a good guy or I\'m a bad guy. I can tell you want I\'m not. I\'m not abusive, I\'m not controlling.\'\n\nThe feuding exes have been in and out of court since they first split back in March 2017. Belafonte revealed his disappointment that all his children can now read about his and Mel\'s \'dirty\' and \'messy\' divorce because of his former wife\'s actions\n\nBelafonte has biological daughter Madison (center) seven, with Mel but he also raised Mel\'s daughter with Eddie Murphy, Angel, 11, from birth. He also has another daughter Gisele from a previous relationship\n\nBut constant attacks in the media at the hands of his ex-wife have been tough, he says: \'I\'m a grown man, I don\'t care what people say about me.\'\n\nHe does care, however, how his children are affected.\n\nBelafonte has biological daughter Madison, seven, with Mel but he also raised Mel\'s daughter with Eddie Murphy, Angel, 11, from birth. He also has another daughter Gisele from a previous relationship.\n\n\'I lost my stepdaughter, who I love more than anything, that I had from a brand new baby up until she was ripped from me with no explanation.\n\n\'The last text message I ever got from her was, ""Daddy, where are you? Why won\'t you call me back?\n\n\'And I was never allowed to talk to her.\'\n\nBelafonte hasn\'t seen Angel since, despite fighting in vain to get court-ordered step-parent visitation rights.\n\nIn the first eight months after the split he was also restricted to seeing Madison twice a week on supervised visits.\n\n\'I had to sit in a room with a person that was staring at me because he was told maybe I would pull a knife out and stab my daughter,\' he said.\n\n\'How would Melanie allow young, amazing women, as this Girl Power person, to be subjected to such craziness. It doesn\'t make any sense.\'\n\nBut he now spends a lot of time with Madison and is looking forward to the future.\n\n\'I\'m going to continue to be an amazing father to my daughter, I look forward to the day I can walk up to Angel and show her how hard her step-daddy fought for her.\n\n\'I am just going to go on with my life, work hard and try to forget all the negativity Melanie has created and I\'m gonna fight really hard in court to have the truth come out.\'\n\nHe did feel it was time to defend himself, though.\n\n\'You\'d take a bullet for your child any day of the week, but Melanie keeps firing bullets and at the very end my daughters are going to read all of the negative things she\'s saying. So I had to. I was forced to come forward to talk to tell people what really happened.\'\n\nDailyMail.com has reached out to Mel B\'s reps for comment.\n\nDespite their divorce being final in December 2017, trying to settle complicated issues between them mostly over children and money, dragged on for another nine months and the warring couple didn\'t settle until August this year.\n\nEarlier this month they finally reached an agreement that brought to an end their vicious battle over money and custody of Madison.\n\nThe warring couple have been ordered to stay 200 yards away from each other.\n\nAnd Mel must cough up $350,000 for Belafonte\'s legal fees and pay him an additional $5,000 a month in child support for Madison.\n\nMel is also being sued for defamation by her former nanny Lorraine Gilles after branding her in court papers a \'prostitute\' and \'home-wrecker\'.\n\nThe singer has lost multiple appeals and the case is expected to go ahead with the first hearing on December 4.\n\nIn Brutally Honest the former Spice Girl details how she was drinking heavily and snorting lines of cocaine in between X Factor shoots to deal with depression.\n\nIn the eye-popping book Mel also opens up about her love of sex and threesomes, her controversial relationship with Eddie Murphy, her sadness over her father\'s death and her fractious relationship with the Spice Girls.'"

"b'The Hills may have ended six years ago, but many of the show\'s best moments are eternal. You know what you did. Truth and time tells all. And of course, I wanna forgive you and I wanna forget you. In honor of the show\'s 10th anniversary, Heidi and Spencer Pratt walked Cosmopolitan.com through nine of the show\'s biggest moments, including Heidi\'s memorable confrontation with with Lauren Conrad at Les Deux and that ""proposal"" scene in season three.\n\n1. Season 3, Episode 1: Lauren and Heidi run into each other at Frankie\'s birthday party after all of the sex tape drama; Lauren utters the famous line, ""You know what you did!""\n\nThis content is imported from Third party. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.\n\nSpencer: Lauren did not want to have any of this talked about on the show. That\'s why it always seems like Heidi\'s showing up everywhere, like, blindsiding her, because Lauren was like, ""No, I don\'t wanna talk about this stuff and I don\'t want the actual truth on the show, and if Heidi says it, they\'re gonna use it."" So I think they kind of set Lauren up and then they set Heidi up and then all of a sudden it just, boom! That happened. I don\'t think Lauren even wanted to have that little moment and I don\'t think Heidi knew what she was even getting to, and then I think Audrina just threw gasoline on the fire when she was like, ""You\'re brainwashed, you\'re brainwashed!"" And then I think that just got L.C. double pumped up.\n\nHeidi: Actually, for that one, they weren\'t ready for it, because that was just a real moment where I came and saw Lauren, and Lauren was trying to avoid me. I think they rushed in a quick camera light.\n\nSpencer: I think that was the only time The Hills shot anything that wasn\'t on a tripod, because it was just like everything happened so fast.\n\n\n\nThis instance in particular was one where the show was avoiding discussing how much this was being talked about on blogs off-camera. Do you think they should have incorporated more of the real gossip that was going around at the time?\n\nSpencer: I always say that because I love the fame world, I love all those magazines, but some people \xe2\x80\x94 I don\'t know who they are, but I heard there\'s people on earth that aren\'t into the fame aspect of famous people. But my personal thing [is] you cover all this stuff and you have L.C. crying about the Perez Hilton post or whatever, and if anything, it makes the stakes way bigger. Not like, ""Oh, he told blah, blah, blah who told blah, blah, blah, and I\'m mad about three people?"" It\'s like, no, we can get why you\'re mad if it\'s on a big site that everyone\'s going on ... But they were all about, ""These are just normal kids living in Hollywood."" It\'s like no, this isn\'t what normal kids in Hollywood are like, actually.\n\n2. Season 3, Episode 2: Spencer paints a Hollywood mural on the wall of his and Heidi\'s apartment. Heidi is not pleased.\n\nMTV\n\nSpencer: I really liked it! I wish we could have kept it. My high-school bedroom had a graffiti mural in it and my loft in college, so it was definitely a real thing. My parents just painted over my ""good times"" mural in my high-school room this year, which I\'m very angry about. Even though it was over the top, it really was true to my taste. My college loft had a huge downtown L.A. with the skyscrapers, and it was my buddy who was a famous graffiti artist who had done all three of them. It was a real. If you asked me what do I want on this wall, I really would have had that.\n\nDo you have any murals in your house now?\n\nHeidi: No. No, no, no, no, no.\n\nSpencer: Married life. Hashtag married life.\n\n3. Season 3, Episode 2: Spencer proposes to Heidi on a beach in Santa Barbara.\n\nSpencer: I just actually watched some behind-the-scenes footage that I have tapes of and I had a conversation \xe2\x80\x94 I will say no names because I don\'t know if I\'m even legally allowed to say that I have footage \xe2\x80\x94 but in this conversation, I make it very clear, I say to them, ""Why did you edit the promise ring scene into our engagement?"" Because at the time, we were talking MTV into doing our own ""newlyweds get engaged and get married"" mini-series special that would have been, like, six episodes, that would have aired while The Hills was on a break, in between seasons. They actually stole that when they heard that that was happening, so they kinda like jacked it from us and turned a promise ring scene into an engagement ring, and it kind of snowballed from there. Technically, that was a promise ring.\n\nYeah, because you don\'t actually say, ""Will you marry me?""\n\nSpencer: Yeah, I said, ""Take this promise ring,"" and they clipped that out.\n\nHeidi: I don\'t think Spencer ever really said, ""Will you marry me?"" in real life or on camera. I don\'t think that ever really happened.\n\nWere you shocked when it happened, Heidi?\n\nHeidi: No, because we were planning everything together.\n\nSpencer: Heidi paid for that ring!\n\nDid you pick it out?\n\nHeidi: Yeah, I did pick it out.\n\nSo the scene where you shop for it with Brody\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n[They both laugh.]\n\nSpencer: Nope.\n\nHeidi: I wish he picked it out because then he would have paid for it.\n\nSpencer: Heidi had all the cash.\n\nHeidi: No, I didn\'t!\n\n4. Season 3, Episode 7: Spencer and Heidi run into Lauren and Jason at Ketchup and send drinks to their table, but Lauren sends them back.\n\nThis content is imported from Third party. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.\n\nSpencer: First off, we were set up. We thought we were just going to dinner at Ketchup, because that was the new hot spot or whatever, and they set it up knowing that Lauren brought Jason there to scream at Heidi ... All of a sudden, we have this producer come up to us and say, ""Just so you know, we\'re not legally liable for what Jason\'s gonna do,"" and we\'re like, ""What?! Legally liable?"" They keep on saying, ""Heidi, go back over there."" Heidi probably went over there, I don\'t know, five times?\n\nHeidi: Yeah.\n\nSpencer: They kept on texting Heidi, ""Lauren wants to talk to you,"" and she\'d go over there and Lauren would just stare at her and they wouldn\'t do anything. This probably happened five times and finally they were like, ""Send her a drink or whatever."" We were just literally going off whatever our BBMs were saying to do, and then they sent [the drinks] back, and then the producers said, ""What\'s gonna happen, we\'re not legally liable for what Jason does."" So we\'re like, ""We\'re outta here."" He was, like, punching the air and acting all wild in the corner, so we just jumped in a taxi and they were like, ""No, you can\'t leave yet."" So whatever was supposed to happen that night that was all planned that Lauren brought in Jason to do to us or whatever, they didn\'t get to do it because one producer actually was pretty much like, ""You should get out of here.""\n\n\n\n5. Season 3, Episode 14: Heidi goes over to Lauren\'s apartment in an attempt to make amends. Lauren rebuffs her with the immortal line, ""I wanna forgive you and I wanna forget you.""\n\nThis content is imported from Third party. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.\n\nHeidi: What people don\'t realize is how hard and how much courage it took me to even do that. I kept getting thrown under the bus over and over, and I knew that I was gonna come off as a bad friend, because it was her show and I already knew what she was saying in the storyline, and then to have all the cast and all the crew and everyone against you, and then knowing that Lauren could just sit there on her high horse and look down on me and be like, ""No, I\'m not taking your apology"" was really hard. And it was really hard to continue to do that over and over, so I had a feeling that was gonna happen. But honestly that was my best friend for a long time, and I thought, You know what, no matter what I owe it to her and myself just to try one more time, so it was like the ultimate rejection on a very challenging and emotional level, especially for something I really had nothing to do with. It was very hurtful and hard for me.\n\nRewatching it now, you seem very genuinely invested in repairing the friendship.\n\nHeidi: It was very one-sided, which was hard too. She didn\'t care at all and it was really hard for me to go in there knowing what was gonna happen and knowing how she was gonna treat me and I cared. That was really my best friend ... It was heartbreaking for me to have to go through that and not to have anyone back me up with her. I think that if other people had encouraged her more like, ""Look, this really is your best friend, you guys really should try to work it out on- or off-camera, like just in real life,"" but no one was doing that. Everyone was just capitalizing on the breakup of our friendship, and other cast members wanted to be her new best friend and hang out with her, so we just had nobody trying to help us repair a real relationship.\n\n6. Season 4, Episode 19: Spencer and Heidi elope in Mexico.\n\nHeidi: Spencer planned the trip, and I didn\'t really know what was going on. I was like, ""OK, it\'s for Us Weekly."" This was off-camera ... I was like, ""Is this for real or for fake, are you really trying to marry me? Like what is going on?"" Spencer was like, ""No, I really do wanna marry you."" I was very confused myself. And then when we got there, we wrote our vows. That is our wedding anniversary we actually do celebrate. To me that was the most meaningful.\n\nYou celebrate that one instead of the wedding that was on TV?\n\nSpencer: We celebrate them all. It\'s a few months earlier, but that\'s definitely my favorite one. When The Hills found out that we eloped and it wasn\'t on camera, they called screaming at us and so they were like, ""You\'re gonna have to redo all this."" Then they flew us back to Cabo and we had to fake one. The first [trip to Cabo San Lucas] was the one that Us Weekly had [on] the cover. That was the real elopement where we really got married in a church. They didn\'t even do that on the fake one because they were like, ""No we wanna have a wedding back in L.A. with the cast."" We had a real wedding on the first [trip] at the Palmilla in Cabo at their chapel on the property.\n\n7. Season 4, Episode 20: Heidi and Spencer go to the courthouse to make it legal, but Spencer backs out at the last minute so Heidi can have her dream wedding.\n\nSpencer: That was a real judge.\n\nHeidi: They told us, ""Legally you have to go in there with the intention that you\'re gonna do it, but Heidi, you can change your mind in there."" Because it\'s illegal to fake a court. It\'s this whole weird thing. So we\'re like, ""OK, don\'t get us in trouble or anything!"" But we never had any intention of making it legal there because the whole storyline was to have the real wedding and go through the steps and blah, blah, blah.\n\n\n\nIt\'s such an emotional scene though!\n\nHeidi: I was thinking about going to jail! They were like, ""You have to really convince the judge or else this is illegal.""\n\nSpencer: Heidi really did want a big wedding. That was real. She wasn\'t very thrilled with our Cabo one.\n\nHeidi: Yeah, I was like, ""Uh, my parents are gonna be really upset,"" and I\'ve dreamed of a big wedding my whole life so I\'m definitely gonna get that.\n\n8. Season 5, Episode 9: Spencer calls Lauren to apologize and ask her to come to the wedding. Lauren has said this phone call never happened.\n\nSpencer: I would love to know how much they paid her bonus-wise just to go to the wedding. But that was part of the deal she made with the producers, that I needed to call and apologize to her. At this stage, whatever I got on my BBMs is what I did to get my check, so I had so many fake calls with so many people. It was nothing to me. But yeah, I wasn\'t talking to her, I was talking to some producer and I was reading a script of exactly what they wanted me to say, that she probably typed. So thank you, Lauren, for telling the truth that I didn\'t have to apologize for something I didn\'t do ... I bet our wedding to this day is her biggest appearance fee she\'s ever gotten or will get in her whole life. I would love to know. I bet they gave her a million dollars to go to our wedding.\n\n9. Season 5, Episode 10: Heidi finally gets the big wedding she\'s always wanted.\n\nThis content is imported from Third party. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.\n\nHeidi: The part that I was obviously the most concerned with was my dress, and I loved that Monique Lhuillier, I thought she did such a good job. It was beautiful, one of a kind. But I was also unhappy with our family and all the drama that was surrounding us with that and the producers, so even though it was a great day and I really was happy to be married to Spencer, there was just so much off-camera drama that it put a bad taste in my mouth as well.\n\nWhen you\'re planning a wedding that\'s going to air on TV, do you still get to have a lot of say in the decor and the venue?\n\nHeidi: Not the venue, that was another issue. We did not want it in Pasadena because we weren\'t over there. We wanted the West Side or Malibu or somewhere outdoors or beautiful, but they had one church that they could clear, so we were not able to choose where the wedding was. But for other details \xe2\x80\xa6 my mom really did a lot of that planning because I was so torn between ""this is just a TV wedding"" and ""it is my real wedding"" that I was kind of indecisive about it. I was just so confused as well so I halfway did it. But looking back, I wish I would have been a little bit more involved with certain aspects of it, because it was my one big wedding of my life and I don\'t think I really realized it.\n\nFollow Eliza on Twitter.\n\nEliza Thompson senior entertainment editor I\xe2\x80\x99m the senior entertainment editor at Cosmopolitan.com, which means my DVR is always 98 percent full.\n\nThis content is created and maintained by a third party, and imported onto this page to help users provide their email addresses.

If I want a glass of wine I\xe2\x80\x99m going to have it, or some chocolate \xe2\x80\x94 sure why not!

The overnight oats at breakfast pack heart-healthy fat and protein from the peanut butter, filling fiber from the oats and banana, and the cinnamon helps keep blood sugars stable. El Moussa gets more thumbs up for her snack, though the Perfect Bar is calorie-heavy at 300 per bar. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s inching closer to a meal replacer,\xe2\x80\x9d Moore says. But it works in tandem with her lighter lunch, which adds more healthy fats and beta-carotene from the greens. El Moussa\xe2\x80\x99s dinner is \xe2\x80\x9csatiating and a perfect way to end the day,\xe2\x80\x9d though Moore suggests adding a vegetable slaw to round out the tacos. And she gives El Moussa a thumbs up for enjoying wine and chocolate a few times a week for \xe2\x80\x9ca nice treat.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNOTE: It is recommended that women eat at least 1,200 calories per day, and men eat at least 1,800 calories per day."""

At the time of the little girl's birth, Bristol was living in Alaska with her family, while Dakota was thousands of miles away at his home in Kentucky.\n\nThe two had previously been engaged, but called off their wedding just days before it was set to take place.\n\nIn May of 2016, months after Sailor's birth DailyMail.com exclusively revealed that Dakota was fighting for his daughter's last name to be changed from Palin to Meyer.\n\nHe also shared details about the furious custody and visitation battle raging on between the exes, claiming that Bristol had made it incredibly difficult for him to even meet his daughter.\n\nNo more: Bristol and ex-husband Dakota Meyer (pictured in October 2017) settled their divorce this month\n\nWhoops: Single again, Bristol announced her pregnancy with Sailor shortly after she split from Dakota the first time, calling off their wedding\n\nDad: Dakota was not in the picture when she gave birth, but they later got back together and wed in June 2016\n\nAccording to Dakota, Bristol had refused to allow him proper visitations with his child, with the mother insisting that her daughter could not be away for long periods of time because she was being breastfed.\n\nIndeed, the former marine, who was based in Kentucky at the time, did not actually get the chance to see his baby girl in person until March \xe2\x80\x94 three months after her birth \xe2\x80\x94 when he made the 3,600-mile round-trip journey from his home to Anchorage, Alaska, where Bristol was living with her family.\n\nThe turmoil came after after a dramatic breakup earlier in 2015. Bristol and Dakota had initially announced their engagement in March of that year, and had planned a wedding for May 23 when, just days before, it was suddenly called off.\n\nThe wedding cancellation came as news broke that Dakota had been previously married.\n\nThen, on June 25 \xe2\x80\x94 just a month after their nuptials were supposed to have taken place \xe2\x80\x94 Bristol, who gave birth to son Tripp when she was in a relationship with ex-fiance Levi Johnston, took to her blog to announce that she was pregnant.\n\n'I know this has been, and will be, a huge disappointment to my family, to my close friends, and to many of you,' she wrote.\n\n'Tripp, this new baby, and I will all be fine, because God is merciful.'\n\nShe later revealed that the pregnancy was planned because she wanted a bigger family while she was still with Dakota, but she added, 'I got ahead of myself.'\n\nAt the time of the pregnancy announcement, neither Bristol or Dakota confirmed that he was the father of Bristol's unborn child. Both chose to remain quiet up until Sailor was born in December, after they had been separated for seven months.\n\nFamily: Bristol and Dakota went on to have another daughter, Atlee, totaling three kids for the single mom\n\nThey grow up so fast! Sailor is now two and a half\n\nFast: Bristol and Dakota filed for divorce earlier this year after a year and a half of marriage\n\nAfter the little girl's birth, Dakota took to Twitter to finally reveal that he was in fact her biological father, proudly sharing an image of a sleeping Sailor while writing, 'Best Christmas present ever!! I couldn't be more proud of this little blessing.'\n\nThings then took a dramatic and rather bitter turn between the former couple, as they began their furious battle over custody and visitation of the little girl.\n\nBut, surprisingly, the two managed to reconcile, and got back together just a few months after news of the bitter battle had been made public. They then married in a secret June 2016 ceremony.\n\nThey went on to have another daughter, Atlee Bay, in May 2017, before announcing their divorce earlier this year.\n\nBristol's latest post about the birth of their daughter Sailor comes less then one week after Dakota took to Instagram to make some thinly-veiled jabs of his own at his ex.\n\nWhile doing a Q&A on his Insta Stories last Monday, the former marine confessed that he has no plans to marry again, while revealing that he and Bristol split because 'she wasn't happy with him'.\n\nWhen responding to a follower's question about what advice he had for someone going through a divorce, he candidly wrote: 'Take it one day at a time and focus on you.'\n\nCutie: Bristol also shared a cute video of Sailor this weekend\n\nTroublemaker: In it, the little girl says she called the police (though it seems to just be on her walkie-talkie)\n\nShe's on fire! She's dressed in a mini firefighter's uniform\n\n'Everything is just a moment in time. You can try everything and give the person all you have and if they don't choose to see good in you it's out of your control. Know when enough is enough.'\n\nHe also shared some thoughts about how fatherhood has changed him, and even alluded to the fact that he might not have been entirely prepared to take on the responsibility when his first daughter was born.\n\n'Both of my girls have got me through so much but Sailor is what turned me into a man and made me not just want to be better but to make the commitment,' he wrote. 'I'd do whatever it took to be the best dad ever.'\n\nThe online bickering doesn't seem to have bothered Bristol, who is now a single mother-of-three and is set to document her day-to-day life with her children on the upcoming season of Teen Mom.\n\nFuture reality star Bristol found some time to hit the beach over the weekend to enjoy some fun in the sun.\n\nShe uploaded a photo to Instagram showing her sitting on a towel on the beach, wearing a red bikini and jean shorts with a baseball cap and sunglasses. She flaunted her long legs in the snap, which showed her laughing happily at the camera.\n\nBristol also shared a video of her daughter Sailor, which captured the little girl dressed in a firefighter's uniform and using a walkie-talkie.\n\nBristol, off-camera, can be heard asking Sailor if she just called the cops \xe2\x80\x94 presumably in a make-believe way on her walkie-takie \xe2\x80\x94 to which Sailor answers affirmatively.\n\nWhen asked what she said, Sailor says, 'Mommy's being annoying.'\n\n'That's not nice,' Bristol replies, but can't hold in her laughter."""

"b'If you haven\'t heard the latest celebrity couple news, Danica Patrick and Aaron Rodgers are dating. But in light of that surprising news, some fans might be wondering when Rodgers and Olivia Munn broke up? After three years of dating, the Green Bay Packers quarterback and the Six (director: Kimberly Peirce) actor reportedly went their separate ways in April 2017.\n\nAccording to a ""source close to the situation"" who spoke with People last April about their split, ""They have amicably ended their relationship of three years,"" and the former couple ""remains close friends and wish nothing but the best for each other moving forward."" Per a source, who spoke with E! News that same April, the former duo were ""just on two different pages in life"" at the time of their breakup. The insider added, ""It was Olivia that called the break.""\n\nIn August 2017, Rodgers opened up slightly to ESPN the Magazine about his split with Munn. Regarding what he learned from their relationship, the NFL player responded, ""When you are living out a relationship in the public eye, it\'s definitely ... it\'s difficult. It has some extra constraints, because you have other opinions about your relationship, how it affects your work and, you know, just some inappropriate connections.""\n\nAs for Munn, she spoke with Collider in September 2017 and reflected on her former relationship with Rodgers and filming a cameo for Ocean\'s Eight when they were dating. ""During that time, I was in a relationship where I didn\xe2\x80\x99t work,"" she said. ""He played football, so during the season, for three years, I\xe2\x80\x99d have to go do press, but I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t work. I just wanted to be there to be supportive. But then, this came up. It worked out that it was on a day off, so I flew out and did it.""\n\nWhen they were together, there were also engagement rumors. At the end of January 2017, Munn was spotted leaving a Beverly Hills party wearing quite the sparkler on her ring finger. There were also engagement rumors in January 2016, but Munn shut those down while appearing on Live With Kelly and Michael. ""I normally wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t answer yes or no, but I thought\xe2\x80\xa6 I should just say no so I don\xe2\x80\x99t have to get asked all the time,"" she said.\n\nNow, less than a year later after their breakup, Rodgers is dating NASCAR driver Patrick. Rumors of their coupling started at the beginning of January, but now it\'s official. While chatting with the Associated Press Monday, Patrick confirmed their relationship. ""Yes, Aaron and I are dating,"" she said.\n\nThe 35-year-old race car driver revealed their first ever encounter was at the 2012 ESPY Awards. ""I told him a long time ago I\'d always root for him as a player,"" she told the AP. Even though she is a Chicago Bears fan, Patrick said that all changes now that they are romantically involved. ""Now I am probably going to cheer for the whole team,"" she said. ""Take out the word \'probably.\' Now I\'m going to cheer for the whole team.""\n\nPrior to Rodgers, Patrick was dating Ricky Stenhouse Jr., also a NASCAR driver. A spokeswoman for Patrick confirmed their split to People in December 2017 saying they are ""no longer in a relationship."" They were together for five years.\n\nRodgers has yes to comment on his romance with Patrick, but knowing him, he\'ll probably keep this relationship relatively private and only talk about it when he feels it\'s necessary.'"

"b'I had a panic attack the other day at work. When I felt the panic start, I grabbed my things and went straight to the toilet and sat hyperventilating on the floor. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t leave that room for about 40 mins. It was horrible. It was brought on by a day that ended up being more stressful than I anticipated.\n\nIt was a day I had been looking forward to because I was attending a meeting related to Inclusion and Diversity at work, and in those meetings I often feel safer than I do in any other meeting. However, as the meeting went on, I realised that just because I am in a meeting related to inclusion, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that I will feel completely welcome or accepted. There was one person in particular that responded to me in a way that made me feel more unwelcome than the others.\n\nI feel like I have to stand up for injustice and unfairness at work and in daily life. I feel like I have to be the one to say, this is not right and why should we put up with this unacceptable behaviour anymore? The problem is, I am just not resilient enough to cope with it all yet. I struggle to be one of the only voices in the room stating that something is unfair. I am struggling to be the one that is constantly challenging the norm and then being challenged for highlighting what is unfair.\n\nWhat everyone needs to keep in mind when it comes to promoting Inclusion and Diversity, is that often those that volunteer their time to support initiatives supporting inclusion, are doing it because they have gone through something themselves. Those volunteers know what it is like to be treated differently and have lived through adversity.\n\nLeaders within an organisation have to recognise that the volunteers who care about inclusion and diversity are often from a vulnerable minority group, despite what they can see on the surface. People may look at me and see a confident young white woman with her career before her (I hope I do, although I fear I may have stunted my career due to my involvement in Inclusion and Diversity) and they potentially think that I am simply an advocate for diversity as a young white woman I can\xe2\x80\x99t possibly have had to deal with any issues? Could I?\n\nWhat people do not see is that on a daily basis I am battling with mental health issues that I have had to manage for the past 10 years. According to some, I would be considered disabled. I admit that my issues have occasionally held me back and prevent me from living the way others do. I am probably still in denial that I am disabled, so I will discuss this another day when I can face it and share it with you. All you need to know for now is that I have an anxiety disorder that sometimes prevents me from living a completely free and relaxed life.\n\nAs a woman, I have to deal with daily micro aggressions, as people are now calling them, which are seemingly banal issues but if you pile them up over time have a huge impact on women. For example, at work I am constantly talked over, or what I am said is heard, but then repeated by a man, who then gets acknowledged for it, I have to put up with regular mansplaining, when men feel that they need to tell me what to do and tell me in an incredibly patronising way how I should do something. Outside of work, I have to put up with regular harassment in the streets, men heckling me with inappropriate comments, which causes me considerable amounts of anxiety, as said in another post.\n\nLeaders and managers have an obligation to support those that speak up in the work place, whether they agree or not with the statement or whether or not they think someone is speaking from experience or not, as it takes great courage to say the unpopular thing. Often those that do speak up, have a traumatic history that they do not want others to experience. Also, leaders have to appreciate that it will come at a great cost for those volunteers to speak up, as often those who speak up will see their career progression suffer as a result or will experience mental health issues due to the stress of going against the grain. In my case, my mental health has worsened as a result of standing up.\n\nI am going on about leaders because the other day, I was not supported by a leader when I rightly spoke up about something that was clearly wrong. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to go into the details, but I was really shaken by it. I felt let down by someone who I thought was supportive. I felt quite deflated by the situation and feel I have lost an ally.\n\nI may have never had the ally to begin with. This person perhaps never saw the need to support me. Would they see the need if I gave them an explanation of what I have seen? I am not sure. I like to think they would. The fact is, I can\xe2\x80\x99t and shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t always explain that I am a member of a vulnerable group and therefore should be treated with more respect or treated more carefully than others. We should treat everyone with respect. We should treat everyone with kindness. We should be listening to everyone without judgement or bias.\n\nI live in a world of shoulds and it is tiring me out. I need to stop thinking about the shoulds and just accept reality for what it is. If I can accept that I will probably always be the one speaking up, the one saying the unpopular thing, then I will learn to be more resilient. I will learn to be ready for adversity. I won\xe2\x80\x99t be on the defensive, I will just be prepared to feel alone in a room full of people.\n\nPrepared to be the target and prepared to be the fighter.'"

It was so invigorating and fulfilling to do that work. In terms of an actor, I would never tire of that. Now it has become, \xe2\x80\x98What can we do that is satisfying, and worth continuing, and gratifying to the people who care so much about it.\xe2\x80\x99 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if there is a need to do more. I would never want it to feel like we overstayed our welcome. \xe2\x80\xa6 There\xe2\x80\x99s probably a way to keep these characters alive but I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if that\xe2\x80\x99s the best thing for them.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBledel mentioned she isn\xe2\x80\x99t sure if she\xe2\x80\x99d dive back in for another season:\n\nI think for me it comes down to what story we\xe2\x80\x99re telling.

I told Amy that I hoped Rory would end on a high note. After all her hard work, I wanted to see her succeed and be thriving. So it was a hard thing for me to digest. I was hoping that we would see that she had lived an interesting life and had been fulfilled up until this point where her grandfather dies and [she] comes back home. But, because I know Amy after all these years, I knew it was her true intention and it was something that satisfied her as a writer because she knew the reaction she was going to get from the audience. \xe2\x80\xa6 So I trusted her.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWhat do you think?

Gomez, who, along with her mom, pushed for the series to be made, served as an executive producer on the show.\n\n""I would do anything to be able to have a good influence on this generation, but I definitely relate to everything that was going on,"" said the 24-year-old during a Netflix press event in February. ""I was there for the last episode, and I was a mess just seeing it all come to life, because I\'ve experienced that.""\n\nNow, the story is getting even more personal for Gomez. Along with two of the show\'s breakout stars, Tommy Dorfman (who plays Ryan Shaver) and Alisha Boe (Jessica Davis), the pop star got a semicolon tattoo over the weekend to represent Project Semicolon, a suicide prevention and mental health awareness organization. The symbolic punctuation represents the idea that when one thought ends, a new one begins \xe2\x80\x94 that ""this is not the end but a new beginning.""\n\nThe trio showed off the matching ink on Instagram. ""Project Semicolon is a movement dedicated to presenting hope for those suffering from depression, thoughts of suicide, addiction, and self-injury,"" captioned Boe on her Instagram.\n\nDorfman also describes his own personal struggles with mental health in his past. ""I struggled with addiction and depression issues through high school and early college,"" he wrote alongside a photo of the gang\'s matching tattoos. ""I reached out and asked for help. At the time, I thought my life was over, I thought I\'d never live past the age of 21.

"b'Have you ever had an unexpected run in with an old co-worker? In the latest trailer for Marvel\'s Thor: Ragnarok, Thor finds himself fighting the Hulk in a massive battle arena. The gladiator-esque face off is not exactly a warm reunion between two former Avengers, and it creates a lot of questions. At first Thor seems relieved to run into a familiar face, even if that face is enormous, angry, and green. For a small moment it appears the superhero might be in the clear, but that would be too simple, and the Hulk doesn\'t seem to recognize his old pal. Instead, the Hulk charges full throttle toward Thor, and right before the two meet in the air the trailer cuts to black.\n\nSo, what\'s going on here? It\'s clear that something fishy is afoot, or the Hulk wouldn\'t be trying to clobber a superhero he used to fight evil with. It might have a lot to do with the Grandmaster, a decadently dressed yet rather sinister new villain played by Jeff Goldblum. The Grandmaster seems to be orchestrating this whole fight, and can be seen looking on in disapproval from a skybox above the arena. The big mystery is how the character got the Hulk to turn on a friend. ""Oh, come on,"" Thor says in frustration as the Hulk growls at his friendly approach, and as viewers, we can relate.\n\nOf course, the face off between Thor and the Hulk isn\'t the only excitement in the new trailer. This is the big reveal of Cate Blanchett\'s Hela, the Asgardian goddess of death, a character expected to challenge the series\' protagonist in a major way. ""She plays the worst of the worst. So evil,"" Mark Ruffalo, who plays the Hulk, described Blanchett\'s character in an interview with ET Online. ""She is going to kill us. It\'s such a great part she gets to play.""\n\nEven without Blanchett\'s Oscar-winning acting, the film is packed with stars. Tom Hiddleston reprises his role as Loki, who can only be back once more to try and defeat Thor. It also appears Benedict Cumberbatch will make a high-profile appearance as Doctor Strange, and Tessa Thompson (Creed, Westworld) will play the Asgardian superhero Valkyrie. Anthony Hopkins will once again appear as Odin, and Idris Elba returns as Heimdall. On the performance front, this is not the Marvel movie to miss.\n\nLet\'s just hope that the Hulk recognizes Thor at some point, because it looks like the hero might be in a bit of trouble. It\'s going to take a lot to defeat Blanchett\'s Hela, who was a scary enough villain before they introduced that hat with the evil mutant deer horns and thorn studded sword in this trailer. That\'s not to mention the evil work of Loki and the Grandmaster, who are just two more obstacles in the way of saving Asgard.\n\nThe film hits theaters on November 3, 2017, and director Taika Waititi has promised in interviews that even for a superhero movie, it will be truly strange and ""out there"". This first look trailer definitely supports that claim, but let\'s just hope we get a few more answers before the movie premieres in the fall.'"
"b""If you\xe2\x80\x99re looking for some hints as to what tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cGirls\xe2\x80\x9d finale has in store, Allison Williams is not the person to ask. In an interview with TheWrap, the actress known to \xe2\x80\x9cGirls\xe2\x80\x9d fans everywhere as Marnie Michaels is going to watch it for the first time on Sunday night with show creator and co-star Lena Dunham.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI could have seen it,\xe2\x80\x9d Williams said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey sent it to me, but I just decided I wanted to see it in real time.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWhat we do know is that the final episode of \xe2\x80\x9cGirls\xe2\x80\x9d won\xe2\x80\x99t see Hannah, Shoshanna, Marnie and Jessa giving viewers catharsis by seeing them all together as the screen fades to black. Last week\xe2\x80\x99s episode saw the four come to an uneasy reconciliation with each other in the bathroom of Shosh\xe2\x80\x99s apartment, but with all of them coming to accept that they are all better off without each other. Before the four go their separate ways tomorrow night, Williams told us about how the series has changed her as an actress and how she thinks Marnie has changed as a person.\n\nAlso Read: 'Girls': 10 Times Hannah Showed Up Wearing the Wrong Thing (Photos)\n\nHow did you feel about the decision to have the girls go their separate ways and not see each other in the finale?\n\nI didn\xe2\x80\x99t really know what to make of it from a creator\xe2\x80\x99s point of view because I always try to keep my nose out of what they are doing and I just trust what they\xe2\x80\x99re doing. But from a selfish point of view, I was sad we weren\xe2\x80\x99t all going to be in the same place when the show wrapped because it\xe2\x80\x99s such an emotional moment and it felt strange to know that we were saying goodbye to people who are very close to us before we said goodbye to the show en masse. But I guess it made it more emotionally manageable because the fact that everyone wasn\xe2\x80\x99t done at the same moment meant that everything was more slow and gradual and less of a shock when it was finally over.\n\nMarnie seems to have moments of self-reflection and then backtrack, do you think the scene in the pawn shop this season had a lasting effect in changing how she sees herself?\n\nI love that scene for a million reasons, but especially because Marnie\xe2\x80\x99s ability to view herself has always been hindered by her own point of view on the person she\xe2\x80\x99s talking to. It\xe2\x80\x99s hard for her to take constructive criticism from Hannah, Jessa and Shosh because they\xe2\x80\x99re all peers, so the idea of taking a big lesson from them always felt silly for Marnie. But whenever she faces these cold truths, it comes from unexpected sources.\n\nIn this case, she thinks she\xe2\x80\x99s wearing something she thought this man in a pawn shop had never seen before. She\xe2\x80\x99s like \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m not your average pawn shopper, this is an anomalous situation for me.\xe2\x80\x99 And he tells her, \xe2\x80\x98Hey, nobody comes in here when everything\xe2\x80\x99s great. You aren\xe2\x80\x99t an exception to every rule.\xe2\x80\x99 And whenever somebody says that to Marnie, it\xe2\x80\x99s very tough for her to hear, but it\xe2\x80\x99s important. It\xe2\x80\x99s also easier to hear when it\xe2\x80\x99s not coming from someone you watched throw up at a college party. But the phone call she makes to Desi afterwards shows that the talk had an impact on her that other talks don\xe2\x80\x99t always land. Because it came from this stranger and because it came at a very vulnerable moment for her, it does end up altering things for her. It sets the stage for someone who is starting to learn how to operate in the world given how she is.\n\nAlso Read: 'Black Panther' Cast Does #GetOutChallenge, Scare the Crap Out of Daniel Kaluuya (Video)\n\nThis is a show where the characters hurt each other a lot. Who\xe2\x80\x99s the one person Marnie owes an apology to and who really owes Marnie an apology?\n\nWell\xe2\x80\xa6I sort of think they all owe each other apologies. I think she and everyone she\xe2\x80\x99s ever dated need to apologize to each other. I don\xe2\x80\x99t really know who is at fault, but I do know there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of hurt there. When those relationships are taking form, there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of growing pains and people thrash around and accidentally hurt each other a lot.\n\nMarnie\xe2\x80\x99s no exception to that. Charlie really hurt her. Desi really hurt her by destroying what she thought she wanted and was always going to have and really sending her out into the world in confusion and disarray. But I also don\xe2\x80\x99t know if it should be a full-throated apology because people who have sent her adrift have also triggered some kind of real growth and introspection on her part. I think that tallying of hurt and who is at fault is something that done so much more at the beginning of the show, and at a certain point, there comes a time when they all just call it even.\n\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s true especially in this group of friends. If they were to go back and tally how many times they\xe2\x80\x99ve been hurt or they\xe2\x80\x99ve hurt people and start making amends, I think it would quickly become a pretzel and everyone out of exhaustion would agree to make a blanket apology and move on.\n\nWay back in the first season, \xe2\x80\x9cGirls\xe2\x80\x9d was criticized in some corners for not being diverse enough. Did your time on \xe2\x80\x9cGirls\xe2\x80\x9d increase your interest in telling stories about social issues or in taking roles in projects like \xe2\x80\x9cGet Out\xe2\x80\x9d?\n\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t think \xe2\x80\x9cGirls\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cGet Out\xe2\x80\x9d had anything directly to do with each other. I would have played Rose at any time in my career. It was the sort of role I have always kept an eye out for creatively. I do think \xe2\x80\x9cGirls\xe2\x80\x9d gave me a sort of critical eye towards the projects that I take on because I knew what it looked like to be a part of something that was created carefully. I wanted to be a part of projects that made deliberate choices and took risks. Safety wasn\xe2\x80\x99t something I was interested in anymore and that negated a lot of the roles that were coming my way.\n\nBut as for the criticism of the show, I think being on \xe2\x80\x9cGirls\xe2\x80\x9d has taught me to look for roles that were written from a position of intimate knowledge of what they were writing about rather than about a life they didn\xe2\x80\x99t know, which is why Lena didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to try and screw up writing somebody else\xe2\x80\x99s intimate truth. Because of the nature and tone of \xe2\x80\x9cGirls,\xe2\x80\x9d that would be a big whiff. So now I know to look for shows that take that same approach.\n\nAlso Read: How Dave Porter Merges the Music of 'Better Call Saul' and 'Breaking Bad' (Audio)\n\nI also think \xe2\x80\x9cGirls\xe2\x80\x9d taught me to have the confidence to be patient and wait for the right thing to come along so that when I got the script for \xe2\x80\x9cGet Out\xe2\x80\x9d and then talked to Jordan [Peele], I knew what I had in front of me and I knew that it was worth any risk involved. \xe2\x80\x9cGirls\xe2\x80\x9d has given me so many things, but the biggest has been that quiet confidence to make decisions in an industry that pushes you to make quick decisions because of the artificial urgency about people making up their minds.\n\nIf, ten years from now, there was a reunion movie or miniseries for \xe2\x80\x9cGirls,\xe2\x80\x9d would you be down for it? And what do you think Marnie\xe2\x80\x99s life would look like a decade from now?\n\nOh, of course I would be down for a reunion. I already miss working with these people so I would love to reunite. As for Marnie, I think the only way she can have lasting happiness is if she ends up in a relationship with Elijah or somebody like Elijah, where it\xe2\x80\x99s a very modern romance situation where they both get to do what they want to do outside the marriage. But they have a total support system for each other and get to live life with a partner without having to deal with the messiness of intimacy and love that I think is an Achilles\xe2\x80\x99 heel for both Marnie and Elijah. But we\xe2\x80\x99ll see. If a reunion happens I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that \xe2\x80\x94 as has always been the case \xe2\x80\x94 Lena and Jenni [Konner] and Judd [Apatow] will come up with something that is both completely unexpected and something that I never could have thought of.\n\nThe series finale of \xe2\x80\x9cGirls\xe2\x80\x9d airs Sunday, April 16 at 10 p.m. on HBO.\n\nThis interview has been edited for clarity."""

"b'After a (most likely) very long time in Jungle Cruise line, Disney World guests were gifted with some unexpected Disney magic: Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson crashed their boat!\n\nThe star shocked a full crowd of guests -- plus a very smiley cast member! -- by hopping aboard when they least expected it. ""Surprise!"" Johnson wrote on Instagram. ""It was a GREAT day on the river. Learned a lot. For example, it takes approximately 12.6 minutes for all the passengers to get over the shock of me jumping on the boat and thinking I\'m a DJ lookalike.""\n\nSome of the guests couldn\'t quite wrap their heads around what was happening: ""One passenger even said, \'Oh the real Rock is much smaller than this guy,\'"" Johnson wrote. ""I threw his ass off the boat.""\n\nIt was announced last week that Johnson has officially signed on to produce and star in a Disney live-action movie based on the classic Adventureland ride. As all Disney aficionados know, the iconic attraction -- which first opened all the way back in 1955 at Disneyland -- is led by skippers who guide the boat along the winding rivers of Asia, Africa and South America.\n\nThe skippers are known for their goofy jokes, and thankfully, The Rock knows the importance of their beloved corniness: ""Yes, with me as the Cruise Skipper there will be an abundance of puns,"" he wrote.\n\n""Best part about this surprise research day was knowing how FUN of an experience we\'re gonna work hard to create for families around the world. That\'s the part that gets [me] excited the most,"" he added. ""It\'s the cruise of a lifetime. And trust me, you\'ll want me as your Skipper.

"b'Are Vanderpump Rules couple Brittany Cartwright and Jax Taylor getting their own wedding spin-off on Bravo?\n\nDuring a new joint interview, the engaged couple let it slip that they are, at the very least, in talks to have their wedding televised on their own series.\n\nWhen asked about their plans for a bachelor and bachelorette party, Jax let it slip that only one of his bachelor parties (he\xe2\x80\x99s having two) will be on-camera. Brittany then corrected him, stating that it\xe2\x80\x99s not certain yet that their wedding festivities will be televised.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s going to be two bachelor parties,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jax to E! News Daily Pop. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s going to be one for all the guys, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to go on a ski trip in Aspen, I think next month. That one\xe2\x80\x99s going to be off-camera. And then the on-camera one is going to be in Miami.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, we\xe2\x80\x99re hoping on-camera. We don\xe2\x80\x99t know. We haven\xe2\x80\x99t been picked up yet,\xe2\x80\x9d added Brittany.\n\nWhile the couple has yet to announce their official wedding date, having their bachelor/bachelorette parties in January would point to a winter or spring wedding. And since Vanderpump Rules usually films during the summer months (filming on the latest season started in July), it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to imagine they won\xe2\x80\x99t be getting their own spin-off to document their big day.\n\nAdditionally, as most fans of Pump Rules are aware, a wedding spin-off would not make the first for Brittany and Jax as they had another spin-off last year titled Jax And Brittany Take Kentucky.\n\nWhile Brittany and Jax continue to move forward with plans for their wedding, Brittany, who got engaged to Jax this past June, is opening up about how she moved on from Jax\xe2\x80\x99s fling with Faith Stowers and learned to trust him again.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see him every single day making efforts and he\xe2\x80\x99s completely changed the way he treats me, the way he talks to me, the way he listens to me. Every single thing about our relationship is better,\xe2\x80\x9d Brittany revealed to Us Weekly. \xe2\x80\x9cI know how much he\xe2\x80\x99s wanting the wedding and how much he\xe2\x80\x99s wanting to marry me, how much effort he\xe2\x80\x99s putting into the wedding, just as much as me. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, whenever you know somebody as well as I know Jax, you can just tell.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAccording to Brittany, she\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cvery big on forgiveness\xe2\x80\x9d but often struggles to forget about Jax\xe2\x80\x99s past infidelity.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is hard, trust me, and there are still days, sometimes, when you can\xe2\x80\x99t help but think of horrible things from the past,\xe2\x80\x9d Brittany explained. \xe2\x80\x9cBut for the most part, we\xe2\x80\x99ve moved mountains in this relationship. I feel like we\xe2\x80\x99re almost starting over, but we\xe2\x80\x99ve grown so much. He does things before I even ask him now. Even just helping around the house. I can just tell in our everyday lives that he\xe2\x80\x99s changed.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nVanderpump Rules season seven premieres on Monday, December 3 at 9 p.m. on Bravo TV.\n\nPhoto Credit: Birdie Thompson/AdMedia/ZUMA Wire/Alamy Live News'"
"b'This article is about the American actor. For other people named Paul Walker, see Paul Walker (disambiguation)\n\nAmerican actor (1973\xe2\x80\x932013)\n\nPaul William Walker IV[3] (September 12, 1973[4] \xe2\x80\x93 November 30, 2013) was an American actor. He is best known for his role as Brian O\'Conner in the Fast & Furious franchise.\n\nWalker began his career as a child actor during the 1970s and 1980s, and gained recognition in the early 1990s after appearing in the television soap opera The Young and the Restless. He received praise for his performances in the teen film She\'s All That and the coming-of-age film Varsity Blues (both 1999), before gaining international fame after starring in The Fast and the Furious (2001).\n\nWalker then starred in the commercially successful road thriller Joy Ride (2001), which led to a reputation as an action star. This continued with his performances in box-office disappointments Into the Blue (2005) and Running Scared (2006). Walker also earned praise in other genres, like in the survival drama Eight Below, and for his portrayal of Hank Hansen the war film Flags of Our Fathers (both 2006). Outside of these, Walker then largely appeared in low budget action films, but starred in the commercially successful heist film Takers (2010).\n\nWalker died on November 30, 2013 at the age of 40 as a passenger in a single-car crash alongside friend and driver Roger Rodas thought to be caused by driving into a gas pipe. Walker\'s father and daughter filed separate wrongful death lawsuits against Porsche, which resulted in settlements. At the time of his death, Walker had not completed filming Furious 7 (2015), which was completed after rewrites and stand-ins, including his brothers Cody and Caleb, filled in for Walker. The song ""See You Again"" by Wiz Khalifa and Charlie Puth was commissioned for the film\'s soundtrack as a tribute to Walker.[5]\n\nEarly life\n\nWalker was born on September 12, 1973, in Glendale, California, to American parents with mostly English, as well as German, Swiss, and Irish ancestry.[6] His mother, Cheryl (n\xc3\xa9e Crabtree), was a fashion model,[7] and his father, Paul William Walker III, was a sewer contractor and former amateur boxer, who was a two-time Golden Gloves champion.[8][9] Walker\'s paternal grandfather, William, had a short-lived boxing career as ""Irish"" Billy Walker, while another raced factory cars for Ford in the 1960s.[7]\n\nRaised a Mormon,[8] Walker had four younger siblings: Aimee, Ashlie, Caleb, and Cody. He spent the majority of his early life in the Sunland neighborhood of Los Angeles, and graduated from Village Christian School in 1991.[10][11] Walker subsequently attended several community colleges in Southern California, majoring in marine biology.[12]\n\nCareer\n\nWalker began a modelling career as a toddler, starring in a television commercial for Pampers at age two. He continued to appear in commercials, most notably for Showbiz Pizza in 1984,[13] before beginning an acting career on television that year, appearing in the teen anthology series CBS Schoolbreak Special. Walker continued to work in television until 1996, across a number of genres; he appeared in two episodes of the fantasy drama Highway to Heaven between 1984 and 1986, and secured his first leading role in 1987, appearing as Jeremy Beatty in the sitcom Throb. He continued to feature on sitcoms in the early 1990s, with guest roles in Charles in Charge, Who\'s the Boss?, and the shortlived What a Dummy. In 1993, he portrayed Brandon Collins on the soap opera The Young and the Restless; he and co-star Heather Tom, who played Victoria Newman, gained fame, and were nominated for Outstanding Lead Actor and Actress in a Soap Opera at the Youth in Film Awards. Walker\'s final television role was on Touched by an Angel, although appeared as himself, alongside his sister Ashlie, as contestants on a 1988 episode of the game show I\'m Telling!, in which they finished in second place.\n\nWalker began his film career in 1986, appearing mainly in low budget B films. His first role was in the horror comedy Monster in the Closet, and a year later, starred The Retaliator (retroactively subtitled Programmed to Kill), a science fiction film. In 1994, he returned to film, starring in Tammy and the T-Rex, but secured his first feature film role in the comedy Meet the Deedles in 1998; although commercially and critically unsuccessful, it allowed Walker to secure supporting roles in the films Pleasantville (1998), Varsity Blues (1999), She\'s All That (1999), and The Skulls (2000).[citation needed]\n\n""[Walker] is that guy. As a director, [Walker is] completely supportive of my vision of what the film is. And even better, he\'s completely game for it."" \xe2\x80\x94Wayne Kramer, who directed and cast Walker in Running Scared (2006).[14]\n\nIn 2001, Walker\'s breakthrough role arrived when he starred opposite Vin Diesel in the action film The Fast and the Furious; it was commercially successful, and subsequently launched a media franchise. The film also established Walker as a film star and leading man, as his performance garnered the MTV Movie Award for Best On-Screen Team (shared with Diesel) in 2002. Walker then reprised his role as Brian O\'Conner in the 2003 sequel 2 Fast 2 Furious, and also starred in the critically successful thriller Joy Ride (2001). After this, Walker starred mainly in either low-budget or commercially unsuccessful films, notably Timeline (2003) and Into the Blue (2005).\n\nWalker had a supporting role, portraying Hank Hansen Clint Eastwood\'s war film Flags of Our Fathers (2006), and starred in the survival drama Eight Below, both released in 2006. Eight Below garnered critical acclaim and opened in first place at the box office, grossing over US$20 million during its opening weekend.[15] Walker then starred in the independent film The Lazarus Project, which was released on DVD on October 21, 2008.\n\nDespite initial reluctance, Walker reprised his role as Brian O\'Conner after six years, in Fast & Furious. The film became the highest grossing film in the franchise up until that point.[16] He reprised his role in the fifth and sixth installments of the franchise, which were commercially successful, while his performances were praised. Walker was nominated for Choice Movie Actor \xe2\x80\x93 Action at the 2011 Teen Choice Awards for the former, and nominated for Choice Movie: Chemistry (with Diesel and Dwayne Johnson) and won his second MTV Movie Award for Best On-Screen Duo with Diesel for the latter. Walker also starred in the heist film Takers (2010),[17] and returned to modelling in 2011, appearing as the face of fragrance brand Cool Water.[18]\n\nAfter his death in 2013, four films starring Walker were released; the thriller film Hours (2013), the action film Brick Mansions (2014), itself a remake of the French film District 13 (2004). He also acted as executive producer on the film Pawn Shop Chronicles (2013), while Furious 7, originally slated for release in 2014, was pushed back to recreate Walker\'s likeness. The filmmakers hired Peter Jackson\'s Weta Digital visual effects house to complete this,[19] using existing reference materials, Walker\'s brothers Caleb and Cody, as well as actor John Brotherton, as stand-ins,[20] and outtakes or older footage,[19][21][22] to create an accurate remodel of Walker\'s face. The film was then released in 2015,[23] and Walker won the award for Choice Movie Actor: Action at the 2015 Teen Choice Awards, and was nominated for Choice Movie: Chemistry (shared with Diesel, Johnson, Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, and Ludacris).\n\nWalker was also set to play Agent 47 in the video game adaptation Hitman: Agent 47, but died before production began.[24] It was later revealed Walker declined the role of Superman in Superman Returns (2006), allegedly due to the Superman curse and the celebrity associated with the role.[25]\n\nPersonal life\n\nWalker was raised in a Mormon household, but later became a non-denominational Christian.[26] He lived in Santa Barbara with his dogs.[8][27] He and Rebecca Soteros, a one-time girlfriend, had a daughter named Meadow Rain Walker,[28] who lived with her mother in Hawaii for 13 years and then moved to California to live with Walker in 2011.[29] Her godfather is Vin Diesel, with whom Walker shared a close bond; Diesel gave him the nickname ""Pablo"",[30] while Walker\'s mother referred to her son as Diesel\'s ""other half"".[31] Walker was also close friends with fellow Fast & Furious co-star Tyrese Gibson.[32] At the time of his death, Walker was dating Jasmine Pilchard-Gosnell.[33]\n\nHe held a brown belt in Brazilian jiu-jitsu under Ricardo ""Franjinha"" Miller at Paragon Jiu-Jitsu[34] and was awarded his black belt by Miller posthumously.[35] Walker founded the humanitarian aid nonprofit charity Reach Out Worldwide (ROWW) with financial adviser Roger Rodas in response to the 2010 Haiti earthquake.[36][37] He traveled to a number of disaster-stricken areas to supply aid until his death.\n\nWalker had an interest in marine biology, and joined the board of directors of The Billfish Foundation in 2006.[38] He fulfilled a lifelong dream by starring in the National Geographic Channel series Expedition Great White (retroactively retitled Shark Men), which premiered in June 2010.[39][40] Walker spent 11 days catching and tagging seven great white sharks off the coast of Mexico. The expedition, led by Chris Fischer, founder and CEO of Fischer Productions, and Brett McBride and Michael Domeier of the Marine Conservation Science Institute, took measurements, gathered DNA samples, and fastened real-time satellite tags to the great white sharks, in order to study migratory patterns, especially those associated with mating and birthing, over a five-year period.[41]\n\nA car enthusiast, Walker competed in the Redline Time Attack racing series in which he raced on the AE Performance Team driving a BMW E92 M3.

In a 45 mph (72 km/h) speed zone on Hercules Street near Kelly Johnson Parkway in Valencia, Santa Clarita, California, the car crashed into a concrete lamp post and two trees subsequently catching fire to the vehicle.[53][55] Rodas died of multiple trauma while Walker died from the combined effects of trauma and burns. Both of their bodies were burned beyond recognition.[54]\n\nThe curve where Walker and Rodas died is a popular spot for drifting cars.[56] No alcohol or other drugs were found in either man\'s system,[57] and neither mechanical failure nor road conditions appeared to play a role.[58] Police found no evidence of drag racing.[59] The investigation concluded that the car\'s speed \xe2\x80\x93 between 80 mph (130 km/h) and 93 mph (150 km/h) \xe2\x80\x93 and age of the tires were the primary reasons for the crash.[60]\n\nGrave of Paul Walker at Forest Lawn Hollywood Hills\n\nWith Furious 7 in the middle of filming at the time of Walker\'s death, Universal announced an indeterminate hiatus on the production, citing a desire to speak with his family before determining what to do with the film.[61]\n\nNumerous friends and movie stars posted tributes to Walker on social media.[62] His body was cremated and his ashes were buried in a non-denominational ceremony at Forest Lawn Memorial Park.[63] His life was later chronicled in the documentary I Am Paul Walker, which was released on August 11, 2018.[64]\n\nLegal repercussions\n\nIn December 2014, Walker\'s father filed a wrongful death claim against Rodas\' estate seeking the return of or ""a proportionate share"" of revenue generated by a group of automobiles that were jointly owned by both Walker and Rodas.[65] In September 2015, Walker\'s daughter filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Porsche, claiming that the Porsche Carrera GT had numerous design defects including a history of instability, and that its seat belt placement can cause harm upon impact.[66] However, Porsche denied any wrongdoing and blamed Walker himself, stating: ""The perils, risk, and danger were open and obvious and known to him, and he chose to conduct himself in a manner so as to expose himself to such perils, dangers, and risks, thus assuming all the risks involved in using the vehicle.""[67]\n\nIn April 2016, U.S. District Court Judge Philip S. Gutierrez ruled in favor of Porsche in a separate lawsuit filed by Rodas\' widow Kristine.[68][69] The ruling had no bearing on two other cases against Porsche which have been filed by Walker\'s father, who is also the executor of the actor\'s estate, and his daughter.[69] Walker\'s father and daughter both reached separate out-of-court settlements with Porsche.[70]\n\nFilmography\n\nAwards and nominations'"

"b'GULLIVER recently wrote about a pet that suffered a grizzly end after it was not permitted to fly. Spirit Airlines refused to allow a hamster on board as an emotional-support animal and it ended up being flushed down an airport toilet. But sometimes it is more dangerous for an animal to be permitted to ascend to 35,000 feet. Particularly, it seems, if it is flying on United Airlines.\n\nOn March 12th, on a flight from Houston to New York, a United Airlines flight attendant knowingly stowed a French bulldog in the overhead compartment, where it died, the family that owned the dog alleges. United quickly apologised to the family for what it called \xe2\x80\x9ca tragic accident that should never have occurred, as pets should never be placed in the overhead bin.\xe2\x80\x9d The airline promised an investigation \xe2\x80\x9cto prevent this from ever happening again.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut on United, things like this seem to happen again and again. Last year, a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel died in a United plane\xe2\x80\x99s cargo hold when the flight was delayed on the tarmac\xe2\x80\x94also in Houston\xe2\x80\x94for two hours. Most infamously, a giant rabbit called Simon travelling from London to the Iowa State Fair died on a United flight, possibly freezing to death because it was subjected to cold temperatures or placed next to dry ice. A week of headlines in British tabloids, such as \xe2\x80\x9cNow United\xe2\x80\x99s killing fluffy bunnies!\xe2\x80\x9d, left its reputation in one of its most valuable foreign markets in tatters. And on March 14th, United fessed up to yet another blunder, this time flying a German Shepherd dog from Oregon to Japan instead of its intended destination, Kansas City in Missouri.\n\nIn fact, according to data from America\xe2\x80\x99s Department of Transportation, United was far more dangerous to fly on as a doggy or bunny last year than any other airline. Some 18 animals perished on United flights, compared with two each on American, Delta, and Alaska, and zero on all other airlines tracked by the department. Some 13 animals were also reported injured on United flights; no other airline had more than one injury. That comes out to 2.24 incidents for every 10,000 animals transported on United. The second-worst offender, American, had 0.87 incidents per 10,000.\n\nUnited gained notoriety for its treatment of human passengers last April when a Vietnamese-American passenger, David Dao, was forcibly dragged off an overbooked flight in Chicago. The company\xe2\x80\x99s initial response was possibly the worst bit of crisis-PR in history. As videos of the bloodied man quickly went viral, Oscar Munoz, the carrier\xe2\x80\x99s boss, woodenly apologised for having to \xe2\x80\x9cre-accommodate\xe2\x80\x9d customers and blamed the flyer for not co-operating. After a passenger backlash the company quickly changed its policy and sought to make amends. Yet some aviation analysts reckon that the death of Simon the bunny did much more damage to United\xe2\x80\x99s reputation in Britain than the manhandling of Dr Dao did in America. What is clear is that its brand will continue to suffer if it does not start treating its animal passengers, as well as it human ones, better.'"

Although she initially dislikes it, she soon loosens up when she pursues a sexual tryst with her free-spirited instructor, Paul-Louis. Back in New York City, Marnie struggles to come to terms with her divorce from Desi, particularly after watching Ray and Shoshanna\'s friendly, affectionate interactions. At the same time, Ray decides to crash at Adam and Jessa\'s apartment despite both of them being deeply and sexually involved with each other.\n\n54 2 ""Hostage Situation"" Lena Dunham Lena Dunham February 19, 2017 ( ) 0.708[53]\n\nHannah reluctantly agrees to accompany Marnie and Desi on a weekend trip to Poughkeepsie, in order to provide Ray with a cover story. There, Marnie discovers that Desi has been addicted to Oxycontin for a year, resulting in a violent argument. After shutting Desi out of the house, Hannah gently explains to Marnie that she didn\'t notice Desi\'s drug addiction because she spends too much time thinking about herself; something that Hannah admits she understands all too well. She reaffirms their friendship, and eventually helps her take Desi home. Meanwhile, Elijah agrees to accompany Shoshanna to a networking event organised by two former college friends of Shosh\'s, who started their own clothing line. To her dismay, Jessa invites herself along. There, her former friends confront her over her having bailed on their Spring Break trip to Aruba with only six hours notice, and for subsequently abandoning them in order to pursue friendships with Jessa\'s circle. Outside, a seething Shoshanna snaps at her cousin, accusing her of ruining her life, and eventually orders her to get out of her face.\n\n55 3 ""American Bitch"" Richard Shepard Lena Dunham February 24, 2017 ( ) (online) [54]\n\nFebruary 26, 2017 ( ) (HBO) 0.383[55]\n\nHannah visits the upscale apartment of Chuck Palmer, a famed, prize-winning writer, who has summoned her after reading an article that she wrote accusing him of coercing college students into having sex with him, and desiring to give her his side of the story. The two engage in a long and tense debate about Chuck\'s shortcomings in his interactions towards women (as he appears unaware of the impact of the power imbalance between him and the college girls Hannah quoted) and Hannah\'s journalistic mistake (since most of her sources for the article were Tumblr blog posts, and therefore relied on hearsay). Eventually, they begin to bond over their shared literary preferences, and their perceived insecurities. However, after Hannah apologizes for writing the article, Chuck manipulates her into grabbing his penis, and Hannah finally understands who he really is. Hannah reluctantly avoids making a scene by agreeing to listen to a flute recital by Chuck\'s visiting daughter, and leaves, looking visibly ashamed, humiliated and enraged.\n\n56 4 ""Painful Evacuation"" Jesse Peretz Lena Dunham & Jenni Konner March 5, 2017 ( ) 0.571[56]\n\nEmotionally rejected by Marnie (who remains privately embroiled in her drama with Desi and his recovery), Ray is beginning to feel disillusioned about their relationship, particularly when she rejects his effort to just hang out with her. Later, when one of his regular customers collapses and dies after Ray is brusque with him, Ray and Hermie get into an argument over the idea that Ray is wasting his potential. Later, when Shoshanna helps Ray to realize Hermie is only trying to help, Ray goes to his friend\'s apartment to apologize, only to find that he has also died. Elsewhere, after Adam angrily quits working on a film set, he and Jessa decide to make a movie together, based on their situation with Hannah. Meanwhile, Hannah is suffering from a yet another urinary tract infection due to her HPV, and eventually decides to go to the emergency room to get some antibiotics; there, she has a surprise encounter with Joshua, her doctor fling from ""One Man\'s Trash"". Joshua then drops another unexpected bombshell, that Hannah is pregnant. On her way home, Hannah is confronted in her stairwell by Jessa and Adam, who ask her for permission to make their movie; irritated and still in shock from her discovery, Hannah mutters her consent.\n\n57 5 ""Gummies"" Jesse Peretz Sarah Heyward March 12, 2017 ( ) 0.703[57]\n\nLoreen (Hannah\'s mother) has come to visit Hannah for a few days, and Hannah informs her of her pregnancy. Although Loreen appears happy with the news, it becomes clear that she has become addicted to cannabis and she is struggling to cope with being alone after her divorce, and the news of Hannah\'s baby only worsens her growing fatalism. After a fight with her daughter at a laundromat while high, Loreen disappears. After hours of looking, Elijah and Hannah find Loreen binging at a Chinese restaurant. There, Loreen breaks the news of Hannah\'s pregnancy to Elijah, who does not take it well, and bluntly tells Hannah she would be a terrible mother because she is selfish and self-obsessed. Meanwhile, a grieving Ray is going through Hermie\'s apartment with an obviously disinterested Marnie. Finally fed up with her self-absorbed behaviour, Ray tells her he wants to break up. Elsewhere, Adam and Jessa are making progress on their film. Jessa becomes worried by some of the lines of dialogue about Hannah and Adam\'s relationship, which Jessa realizes more accurately reflects their own.\n\nHannah finally informs Marnie of her pregnancy, and although she reacts positively, she quickly annoys her by insisting that she has to tell the father. This puts Hannah in a dilemma about whether to do so. Hannah then visits her father and his boyfriend offer her both sides of the argument. Meanwhile, Marnie struggles to convince Desi to perform at a club in New Jersey as a favor to her mother. Desi ultimately turns up high, and Marnie is forced to perform with her mother who soon does a terrible job. Adam starts asking Hannah to watch the first cut of his film, saying he wants her to confirm its accuracy, and when he won\'t stop bothering her, she shocks him by revealing her pregnancy. Subsequent to this, Jessa turns up at Hannah\'s apartment and confronts her for not telling her herself. Despite Hannah making clear that she wants nothing to do with her, Jessa tells her that she cannot just erase everything that they went through. Eventually, Hannah makes a half-hearted attempt to contact Paul-Louis, but doesn\'t succeed. In frustration, she decides to watch Adam\'s film \xe2\x80\x93 and is caught off guard by its surprisingly raw, emotional opening scene. Elsewhere, Elijah, working in retail at his second job, realizes his thespian talent when he agrees to read lines from a play that his co-worker is auditioning for.\n\n59 7 ""The Bounce"" Richard Shepard Murray Miller & Tami Sagher March 26, 2017 ( ) 0.675[59]\n\nTaking the advice of his department store colleague, Elijah decides to attend a workshop audition for a stage remake of the 1992 sports comedy White Men Can\'t Jump, while Hannah is waiting to hear back from Paul-Louis. On his way out, Elijah is surprised by the arrival of his former boyfriend, Dill Harcourt \xe2\x80\x93 who is trying to hide from some paparazzi due to a recent scandal involving him trying to adopt a baby on the black market. Hannah agrees to keep an eye on him at the apartment while Elijah leaves. At the audition, Elijah initially tries to bail, but then meets a young woman named Athena, who persuades him to stay, and the two bond. Elijah\'s audition initially goes well, although it soon emerges he has no control over the basketball he has been given. Meanwhile, upon learning of Hannah\'s dilemma with her baby, Dill firmly tells her that not having a father figure when he grew up was the reason he couldn\'t bring himself to love anybody. Later, Paul-Louis finally calls Hannah back where she finally tells him of her pregnancy. Although he is genuinely surprised, and offers some emotional support, he admits he is not ready to be a father. After the call, Hannah breaks into tears, and an also-crying Dill comforts her. Elijah returns from the audition to find the two bonding over television and pizza, and after initially standing up to Dill, Elijah invites him to his room for sex. The next morning, he receives a phone call from the producers, offering him a part in the play \xe2\x80\x93 on the condition he is kept well away from the basketball. Concurrently, Marnie is broke, and has just received an eviction notice. Unable to get support from her mother, other than a place to sleep, she goes to pawn some of her jewellery, only to discover that all of the seemingly precious jewellery that her parents gave her was fake. When this revelation causes Marnie to throw yet another narcissism-laced tantrum, the appraiser rolls his eyes at her, and tells her that she is merely trying to blame other people for her predicament; the only liar in her life is herself. Deeply affected by this encounter, and realizing that she needs to take responsibility for her life, Marnie leaves a message on Desi\'s voicemail expressing regret at the way she treated him throughout their marriage.\n\n60 8 ""What Will We Do This Time About Adam?"" Jesse Peretz Judd Apatow & Lena Dunham April 2, 2017 ( ) 0.765[60]\n\nHaving given in to his nostalgia, Adam asks Hannah if he can help her raise the baby. Despite her fear that Adam will leave her for good, Jessa offers no resistance and has sex with a stranger in a bar instead. Adam tracks Hannah down and makes his pitch; still riding her wave of loneliness after Paul-Louis\'s phone call, Hannah invites him home for sex. Appearing to have reconciled, Hannah starts making plans for raising the baby with Adam. However, by the day\'s end, both have come to the realization that their enthusiasm for their relationship has already gone, and end up returning home separately. Discovering he doesn\'t have his key, Adam phones a relieved Jessa to buzz him in to their apartment, while Hannah lies on her bed weeping... her fears of having to raise her baby alone now returned. Meanwhile, Ray and Shoshanna meet for lunch with Shosh\'s friend and former boss, Abigail. To Shosh\'s dismay, Ray and Abigail hit it off quickly, and decide to work together to continue Hermie\'s pet project of documenting the effects of gentrification. The two later share a kiss while riding a merry-go-round that evening.\n\n61 9 ""Goodbye Tour"" Nisha Ganatra Jenni Konner & Lena Dunham April 9, 2017 ( ) 0.734[61]\n\nHannah interviews for a position at an unnamed college upstate. She meets with Phaedra, a dynamic creative writing professor who discovered Hannah\'s work online. Heading back to the city, Hannah receives a job offer. Elijah doesn\'t understand why Hannah wants to leave New York. He tries his best to convince her to stay, but she\'s focused on finding a better environment for her baby, and that this is her chance to finally leave the city. In need of advice about her move, Hannah heads to Shoshanna\'s apartment only to find the other girls there celebrating Shosh\'s engagement; Hannah was intentionally left uninvited. Seeing the looming threat of a fight, Marnie calls a group meeting in the bathroom, hoping to resolve their friendship issues. The conversation isn\'t productive, as everything the four girls have to say to each other was already said two years previously in the ""Beach House"" episode, and it ends with Shoshanna declaring she has moved on and no longer wants to be friends with any of them by telling Hannah, Marnie and Jessa that they have held her back from her life and career long enough. Later, when Jessa attempts to make her feel better, Hannah is willing to listen, and they finally make their peace. In one final hurrah, the girls end the night dancing in the apartment, albeit individually. The episode ends as Hannah finally leaves the city and moves into her new home upstate.\n\n62 10 ""Latching"" Jenni Konner Lena Dunham & Jenni Konner & Judd Apatow April 16, 2017 ( ) 0.741[62]'"

The promo highlights Rachel, the new lady for the upcoming 13th season of the ABC dating competition.\n\nAlthough the promo mostly consists of old footage, it reminds us of how much the Bachelor Nation loved the lady. Accompanied by Fifth Harmony\'s ""That\'s My Girl"", Rachel makes an entrance looking beautiful in a red lace gown. The promo offers the background story of the 31-year-old Dallas attorney during her appearance on ""The Bachelor"". It also includes the ""After the Rose"" special when she met the four contestants.\n\nProducer Mike Fleiss took to Twitter in March to share the first photo of Rachel as the rose-giver. Rachel was seen wearing a sleeveless white patterned gown during the night one of the filming in ""Bachelor"" mansion in Agoura Hills, California. Host Chris Harrison was also present in the photo.\n\nIn a previous interview with PEOPLE, Rachel\'s ""The Bachelorette"" predecessor JoJo Fletcher gave advice to the new leading lady. JoJo said, ""So I think I would just tell her not to overthink every situation and at the end of this whole thing, whatever happens she needs to go with your first instinct or whatever thought you keep coming back to. And it\'s tough, try not to overthink, really trust yourself, and stay that smart, confident woman that you are.

"b'Janet Jackson called the police asking for a welfare check on her 1-year-old son, Eissa Al Mana, who was in the care of his father at the time. A watch commander with the Malibu County Sheriff\'s Office told ET that Jackson called shortly before 10 p.m. on Sunday and asked them to check on Jackson\'s son, who was staying with his father at the Nobu Hotel. The baby\'s father is billionaire Wissam Al Mana, Jackson\'s estranged husband.\n\nJackson\'s brother, Randy Jackson, told ET that Janet called 911 after a nanny told her that she was frightened by Wissam\'s behavior, which she thought was aggressive. Randy said that the nanny was so scared she locked herself in a bathroom so she could call the singer.\n\nJanet Jackson and Wissam Al Mana married in 2012.

"b'Looks like it\xe2\x80\x99s time to say our goodbyes\xe2\x80\x94and transfer Vitamin C\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cGraduation (Friends Forever)\xe2\x80\x9d to cassette tape. Though Netflix has yet to officially renew 13 Reasons Why for a third season, if it does, the teen drama\xe2\x80\x99s central character, Hannah Baker, will apparently be absent. Actress Katherine Langford, who plays Hannah, broke the news to Entertainment Weekly on Friday.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor me, we told Hannah\xe2\x80\x99s story so fully in Season 1,\xe2\x80\x9d Langford said, adding that her character was basically in purgatory during Season 2. \xe2\x80\x9cThen being able to officially say goodbye to her\xe2\x80\x94it definitely felt like time. For me, letting Hannah go was in Season 1; Season 2 was for Clay to let her go.\xe2\x80\x9d Representatives for Netflix declined to comment on the status of the show\xe2\x80\x99s renewal or cancellation, but confirmed that Langford\xe2\x80\x99s involvement with the series will officially end with Season 2.\n\nLangford made her on-screen debut in 13 Reasons Why, so the series will always be special to her, she said. Looking forward, however, Langford said she\xe2\x80\x99s also excited about what\xe2\x80\x99s yet to come: \xe2\x80\x9cEven though the show is so huge, and I\xe2\x80\x99m so thankful to have had the opportunity to play Hannah, it still is just one thing that I\xe2\x80\x99ve done, and since then I feel very grateful to have been a part of Love, Simon, and I have another film, Spontaneous. But I think ultimately, I feel like playing Hannah was such a small part of me that was magnified, and I\xe2\x80\x99m just really excited to, over the next few months or years, show the rest of me.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe series can certainly survive without Hannah, considering she\xe2\x80\x99s been dead since Season 1. Her constant presence was one of the lower points of Season 2, if only because it felt forced; the show\xe2\x80\x99s plot also ground to a halt every time Clay began to converse with her newly present ghost.\n\nStill, her loss will alter the alchemy of the series, stripping it of the mysterious storytelling element that differentiated the first season\xe2\x80\x94and some of the second. Season 1 was structured around a series of tapes that revealed the exact circumstances that led Hannah, already dead, to commit suicide. In Season 2, fans learned about other aspects of Hannah\xe2\x80\x99s life that retrospectively shifted her story into a new light. With that layer of mystery gone, what\xe2\x80\x99s left will likely be a far more standard teen drama\xe2\x80\x94not necessarily a bad thing, but almost certainly a factor Netflix will consider as it weighs whether to renew the series. Given that cliffhanger ending in the finale, however, a junior year for 13 Reasons Why still seems likely.'"

"b'Kate Beckinsale Biography\n\nThe beautiful British actress Kate Beckinsale was born Kathrin Romary Beckinsale. She has not only managed to survive but has carved a niche for herself in the cold and cruel world of Hollywood showbiz. She is in the midst of a constantly growing career graph and is highly acknowledged. She became an iconic action star after the release of her cult classic Underworld in 2003 and has worked in many action movies since. She won the Best Actress Award at Sitges \xe2\x80\x93 Catalonian International Film Festival in 1997 for her film Shooting Fish. In 1999 she won the British Supporting Actress of the Year at London Critics Circle Film Awards for the movie The Last Days of Disco and in 2012 she won the Jean-Claude Gahd Dam at Spike Guy\xe2\x80\x99s Choice Awards for her movie Underworld: Awakening.\n\nEarly life\n\n\n\nKathrin Romary Beckinsale was born in London, England. She is the only child of actor Richard Beckinsale and actress Judy Loe. Her father was of one-quarter Burmese descent. She made her first television appearance at the age of four, in an episode of This is Your Life dedicated to her father. When she was five years old, her 31-year-old father died suddenly of a heart attack. Beckinsale was deeply traumatised by the loss and ""started expecting bad things to happen"". While she has seen her father ""more on television than I have in life"", ""there are certainly enough memories for me not to feel that it\'s somebody I didn\'t know.""Her widowed mother moved in with director Roy Battersby when Beckinsale was nine and she was brought up alongside his four sons and daughter. She has a close relationship with her step-father: ""I couldn\'t have knitted a better one ... He wasn\'t pushy, he let me come to him."" She has a paternal half-sister, actress Samantha Beckinsale, but they have not had regular contact. Beckinsale was educated at the fee-paying Godolphin and Latymer School in Hammersmith, West London and was involved with the Orange Tree Youth Theatre. She was a two-time winner of the WH Smith Young Writers Award for both fiction and poetry. She has described herself as a ""late bloomer"": ""All of my friends were kissing boys and drinking cider way before me. I found it really depressing that we weren\'t making camp fires and everyone was doing grown-up stuff."" ""I loathed being a teenager.""She had a nervous breakdown and developed anorexia at the age of 15 and underwent Freudian psychoanalysis for four years\n\n\n\nActing career\n\nEarly acting roles (1991\xe2\x80\x931997)\n\n\n\nBeckinsale decided at a young age that she wanted to be an actress: ""I grew up immersed in film. My family were in the business. I quickly realised that my parents seemed to have much more fun in their work than any of my friends\xe2\x80\x99 parents."" She was inspired by the performances of Jeanne Moreau.She made her television debut in 1991 with a small part in an ITV adaptation of P. D. James\xe2\x80\x99 Devices and Desires. Also that year, she appeared as a young woman engaging in a forbidden affair with a Nazi officer in the Hallmark film One Against The Wind. In 1992 she starred alongside Christopher Eccleston in Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s Dream, a 30\xe2\x80\x91minute Channel 4 short and in 1993, she appeared in the pilot of the ITV detective series, Anna Lee, starring Imogen Stubbs.In 1993, Beckinsale landed the role of Hero in Kenneth Branagh\'s big-screen adaptation of Much Ado About Nothing. It was filmed in Tuscany, Italy, during a summer holiday from Oxford University.She attended the film\'s Cannes Film Festival premiere and later remembered it as an overwhelming experience.\n\n\n\nMove to Hollywood (1998\xe2\x80\x932002)\n\n\n\nAt this point in her career, Beckinsale began to seek work in the United States, something she has said wasn\'t ""a conscious decision...My boyfriend was in a play on Broadway so that\'s why we ended up in New York, and my auditions happened to be for American films"". She starred opposite Chlo Sevigny in 1998\'s The Last Days of Disco. The Whit Stillman film focused on a group of Ivy League graduates socialising in the Manhattan disco scene of the early 1980s. Beckinsale\'s attempt at an American accent was widely praised. Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times felt her role as the bossy Charlotte was ""beautifully played"".\n\n\n\nFocus on small-scale drama (2007\xe2\x80\x932009)\n\n\n\nBeckinsale then made a return to smaller-scale projects: ""My experience is that I sort of stepped away from the independent movies and did a couple of big movies. But that\'s not necessarily how it\'s perceived by everybody else, which I do understand.""""I enjoy an action movie as much as the next person it\xe2\x80\x99s not something that I would like to do solely."" She explained that she had originally decided to appear in Underworld because she felt typecast in classical roles \xe2\x80\x94 it was ""assumed that I use a chamber pot and wear bloomers""\xe2\x80\x93 but that her action career ""kind of took off a little too much"". In 2007, Beckinsale starred opposite Sam Rockwell in the independent drama Snow Angels, based on the novel by Stewart O\'Nan. The harrowing film, in which she played an overwhelmed single mother, put Beckinsale ""in kind of a tough place"".\n\n\n\nPersonal life\n\nRelationships\n\n\n\nBeckinsale had an eight-year relationship with actor Michael Sheen from 1995 until 2003. They met when cast in a touring production of The Seagull in early 1995 and moved in together shortly afterwards. She has said it was ""love at first sight""and that he saved her from ""a hospital for the criminally insane"". In 1997, they appeared in a radio production of Romeo and Juliet.Their daughter, Lily Mo Sheen, was born in London in 1999. The actress has said she was ""embarrassed"" that Sheen never proposed but felt as though she were married: ""If you keep a library book out long enough, you feel it\'s yours.""\n\n\n\nTheir relationship ended in early 2003, after the filming of Underworld.Beckinsale had persuaded director Len Wiseman to cast Sheen in the film, but, while on set, she and Wiseman (who was married) began a relationship. All parties, aside from Wiseman\'s first wife,have maintained that there was no infidelity.Wiseman married Beckinsale on May 9, 2004 in Bel-Air, California. They live in Los Angeles. Beckinsale and Wiseman both remain friends with Sheen.'"

"b'Ask and you shall receive: After a swarm of messages from fans demanding it, HBO announced Big Little Lies is officially returning for a second season. It makes total sense why the network wants to continue this franchise. For one, people loved it: The season-one finale brought in a whopping 1.9 million viewers, which is huge for premium cable. It was also a critical favorite, scoring big at both the Emmy and Golden Globe awards. Will lightning strike twice, though? Based on what HBO has released about season two, it seems like yes. The brand has all the ingredients to make a phenomenal second season (including Meryl Streep).\n\nUntil then, here\'s everything we know about Big Little Lies season two. Fair warning: Season one spoilers ahead!\n\nIt will premiere on June, 9 2019. Let the countdown begin.\n\nThe first full-length trailer looks amazing. It dropped on Friday, May 10. Check it out for yourself, below:\n\nAnd here\'s the other teaser for the season. Released on April 14.\n\nAll of the original cast is returning. Originally HBO had confirmed only Reese Witherspoon and Nicole Kidman. In a press release issued later, the network said most of season one\'s cast is expected to return. All of the original actresses are said to be receiving significant pay bumps, as well.\n\n""We all said goodbye at the end, but we became very close and had such a good time doing it, and the desire to spend more time together was a huge part of it,"" Kidman said at the February TCA panel.

"b'British girl group\n\nThe Spice Girls are an English pop girl group formed in 1994. The group comprises Melanie Brown, also known as Mel B (""Scary Spice""), Melanie Chisholm, Mel C (""Sporty Spice""), Emma Bunton (""Baby Spice""), Geri Halliwell (""Ginger Spice"") and Victoria Beckham (""Posh Spice""). In 1996, Top of the Pops magazine gave each member of the group aliases, which were adopted by the group and media. With their ""girl power"" mantra, the Spice Girls were pop culture icons of the 1990s.[1][2] Time called them ""arguably the most recognizable face"" of Cool Britannia, the mid-1990s celebration of youth culture in the UK.[3] They are cited as part of the Second British Invasion of the US.[4]\n\nThe Spice Girls were signed to Virgin Records and released their debut single ""Wannabe"" in 1996; it hit number one in 37 countries[5][6] and commenced their global success. Their debut album Spice (1996) sold more than 23 million copies worldwide, becoming the best-selling album by a female group in history.[7] Their follow-up album, Spiceworld (1997), was also a commercial success, selling over 13 million copies worldwide.[8] In November 2000, the group released Forever, which was their only album without Halliwell. In January 2001, the group unofficially announced that they were beginning an indefinite hiatus and would be concentrating on their solo careers in regards to their foreseeable future, although they pointed out that the group were not splitting.\n\nMeasures of the Spice Girls\' success include international record sales, vast merchandising enterprises, iconic symbolism such as Halliwell\'s Union Jack dress representing ""girl power"", a film, Spice World (1997), and two reunion tours, 2007\xe2\x80\x932008 and 2019. Under the guidance of their mentor and manager Simon Fuller, the group embraced merchandising and became a regular feature of the British and global press. The group became one of the most successful marketing engines ever,[9] earning up to $75 million per year,[10] with their global gross income estimated at $500\xe2\x80\x93800 million by May 1998.[9]\n\nThe Spice Girls have sold 85 million records worldwide, making them the best-selling girl group of all time, one of the best-selling artists, and the biggest British pop success since the Beatles.[11][12][13] The group have received a number of awards including five Brit Awards, three American Music Awards, three MTV Europe Music Awards, one MTV Video Music Award and three World Music Awards. In 2000, they received the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to British Music. According to Rolling Stone journalist and biographer David Sinclair, ""Scary, Baby, Ginger, Posh, and Sporty were the most widely recognised group of individuals since John, Paul, George, and Ringo"".[14]\n\nBand history [ edit ]\n\n1994\xe2\x80\x931996: Formation and early years [ edit ]\n\n[15] ""WANTED: R.U. 18\xe2\x80\x9323 with the ability to sing/dance? R.U. streetwise, outgoing, ambitious, and dedicated? Heart Management Ltd. are a widely successful music industry management consortium currently forming a choreographed, singing/dancing, all-female pop act for a recording deal. Open audition. Danceworks, 16 Balderton Street. Friday 4th March. 11.00am - 5.30pm. Please bring sheet music or backing cassette"" \xe2\x80\x93 Advertisement placed in The Stage\n\nIn the mid-1990s, relatives Bob and Chris Herbert of Heart Management decided to create a girl group to compete with popular boy bands, such as Take That and East 17, which dominated the pop music scene at the time.[16] In February 1994, together with financier Chic Murphy, they placed an advertisement in the trade magazine The Stage asking for singers to audition for an all-female pop band at Danceworks studios.[16] Approximately 400 women attended the audition, during which they were placed in groups of 10 and danced a routine to ""Stay"" by Eternal, followed by solo auditions in which they were asked to perform songs of their own choosing. After several weeks of deliberation, Victoria Adams, Melanie Brown, Melanie Chisholm and Michelle Stephenson were among 12 women chosen to a second round of auditions in April; Geri Halliwell also attended the second audition, despite missing the first.[16]\n\nA week after the second audition, the women were asked to attend a recall at Nomis Studios in Shepherds Bush, performing ""Signed, Sealed, Delivered"" on their own and in a group. During the session, Adams, Brown, Chisholm, Halliwell and Stephenson were selected for a band initially named ""Touch"".[16] The group moved to a house in Maidenhead, Berkshire, and spent most of 1994 practising songs which had been written for them by Bob Herbert\'s long-time associates John Thirkell and Erwin Keiles.[17] During the first two months, they worked on demos at South Hill Park Recording Studios in Bracknell with producer/studio owner Michael Sparkes and songwriter/arranger Tim Hawes. According to Stephenson, the material the group was given was ""very, very young pop"";[18] one of the songs they recorded, ""Sugar and Spice"", would be the source of their final band name. They also worked on various dance routines at the Trinity Studios in Knaphill, near Woking, Surrey. A few months into the training period, Stephenson was fired from the group and replaced with Emma Bunton.[19] It was also during this time that Halliwell came up with the band name Spice.[16]\n\nThe group felt insecure about the lack of a contract and was frustrated by the direction in which Heart Management was steering them. In October 1994, armed with a catalogue of demos and dance routines, they began touring management agencies. They persuaded Bob Herbert to set up a showcase performance for the group in front of industry writers, producers and A&R men in December 1994 at the Nomis Studios, where they received an ""overwhelmingly positive"" reaction.[20] Due to the large interest in the group, the Herberts quickly set about creating a binding contract for them. Encouraged by the reaction they had received at the Nomis showcase, all five members delayed signing contracts on legal advice from, among others, Adams\'s father.[21]\n\nIn March 1995, the group parted from Heart Management due to their frustration with the company\'s unwillingness to listen to their visions and ideas. To ensure they kept control of their own work, they allegedly stole the master recordings of their discography from the management offices.[21][22] That same day, the group tracked down Sheffield-based producer Eliot Kennedy, who had been present at the showcase, and persuaded him to work with them. They were introduced to record producers Absolute, who in turn brought them to the attention of Simon Fuller of 19 Entertainment, who signed them to his company in March 1995. During the summer of that year, the group toured record labels in London and Los Angeles with Fuller, signing a deal with Virgin Records in September 1995. Their name was changed to Spice Girls, as a rapper was already using the name ""Spice"".[16] From this point on until the summer of 1996, the group continued to write and record tracks for their debut album while extensively touring the west coast of the US, where they signed a publishing deal with Windswept Pacific.[21]\n\n1996\xe2\x80\x931997: Spice and breakthrough [ edit ]\n\nOn 7 July 1996, the Spice Girls released their debut single ""Wannabe"" in the United Kingdom. In the weeks leading up to the release, the music video for ""Wannabe"" (directed by Swedish commercials director Johan Camitz and shot in April at the entrance and main staircase of the St. Pancras Grand Hotel in London), got a trial airing on music channel The Box.[23] The video was an instant hit, and was aired up to seventy times a week at its peak. After the video was released, the Spice Girls had their first live TV slot on broadcast on LWT\'s Surprise Surprise. The first music press interview appeared in Music Week. In July 1996, the group conducted their first interview with Paul Gorman, the contributing editor of music paper Music Week, at Virgin Records\' Paris headquarters. His piece recognised that the Spice Girls were about to institute a change in the charts away from Britpop and towards out-and-out pop. He wrote: ""JUST WHEN BOYS with guitars threaten to rule pop life\xe2\x80\x94Damon\'s all over Smash Hits, Ash are big in Big! and Liam can\'t move for tabloid frenzy\xe2\x80\x94an all-girl, in-yer-face pop group have arrived with enough sass to burst that rockist bubble.""[24] The song entered the UK Singles Chart at number three before moving up to number one the following week and staying there for seven weeks. The song proved to be a global hit, hitting number one in 37 countries, including four consecutive weeks atop the Billboard Hot 100 in the US, and becoming not only the biggest-selling debut single by an all-female group but also the biggest-selling single by an all-female group of all time.[5][25][26]\n\nRiding a wave of publicity and hype, the group released their next singles in the UK and Europe; in October ""Say You\'ll Be There"" was released topping the charts at number one for two weeks. In December ""2 Become 1"" was released, becoming their first Christmas number one and selling 462,000 copies in its first week,[27] making it the fastest-selling single of the year. The two tracks continued the group\'s remarkable sales, giving them three of the top five biggest-selling songs of 1996 in the UK.[28] In November 1996, the Spice Girls released their debut album Spice in Europe. The success was unprecedented and drew comparisons to Beatlemania,[13] leading the press to dub it ""Spice mania""[29][30][31][32] and the group the ""Fab Five"".[33][34][35][36] In seven weeks Spice had sold 1.8 million copies in Britain alone,[37] making the Spice Girls the fastest-selling British act since the Beatles. In total, the album sold over 3 million copies in Britain,[37] the biggest-selling album of all time in the UK by a female group,[38] certified 10\xc3\x97 Platinum,[37] and peaked at number one for fifteen non-consecutive weeks.[39] In Europe the album became the biggest-selling album of 1997 and was certified 8\xc3\x97 Platinum by the IFPI for sales in excess of 8 million copies.[40]\n\n""Wannabe"" Spice Girls debut single ""Wannabe"" is one of the best-selling singles of all time, topping the charts in 37 countries and selling over 6 million copies Worldwide.

At the time, this was the highest-ever debut by a non-American act, beating the previous record held by the Beatles for ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" and the joint highest entry for a debut act beating Alanis Morissette with ""Ironic"".[16] ""Wannabe"" reached number one in the US for four weeks. In February 1997, Spice was released in the US, and became the biggest-selling album of 1997 in the US, peaking at number one, and was certified 7\xc3\x97 Platinum by the RIAA[42] for sales in excess of 7.4 million copies.[43] The album is also included in the Top 100 Albums of All Time list of the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) based on US sales.[44] In total, the album sold over 23 million copies worldwide becoming the biggest-selling album in pop music history by an all-female group.[7]\n\nLater that month, the Spice Girls won two Brit Awards for Best British Video, ""Say You\'ll Be There"" and Best British Single for ""Wannabe"".[16][46] The group performed ""Who Do You Think You Are"" to open the 1997 Brit Awards, with Geri Halliwell wearing a Union Jack mini-dress that became one of pop history\'s most famed outfits.[15][47] In March 1997, a double A-side of ""Mama""/""Who Do You Think You Are"" was released in Europe, the last from Spice, which once again saw them at number one,[48] making the Spice Girls the first group in history since the Jackson 5 to have four consecutive number one hits.[16] Girl Power!, The Spice Girls\' first book and manifesto was launched later that month at the Virgin Megastore. It sold out its initial print run of 200,000 copies within a day, and was eventually translated into more than 20 languages. In April, One Hour of Girl Power was released; it sold 500,000 copies in the UK between April and June to become the best-selling pop video ever.[49][50] In May, Spice World was announced by the Spice Girls at the Cannes Film Festival. The group also performed their first live British show, for the Royalty of Great Britain. At the show, they breached royal protocol when Mel B and then Geri Halliwell planted kisses on Prince Charles\' cheeks and pinched his bottom, causing controversy.[16] At the Ivor Novello Awards, the group won International Hit of the Year and Best-Selling British Single awards for ""Wannabe"". In June 1997, Spice World began filming and wrapped in August. In September, the Spice Girls performed ""Say You\'ll Be There"" at the 1997 MTV Video Music Awards at Radio City Music Hall in New York City, and won Best Dance Video for ""Wannabe"".[51] The MTV Awards came five days after the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, with tributes paid to her throughout the ceremony. Mel C stated, ""We\'d like to dedicate this award to Princess Diana, who is a great loss to our country.""[52] At the 1997 Billboard Music Awards the group won four awards; New Artist of the Year, Billboard Hot 100 Singles Group of the Year, Billboard 200 Group of the Year and Billboard 200 Album of the Year for Spice.[53]\n\n1997\xe2\x80\x931998: Groundbreaking success, Spiceworld and Halliwell\'s departure [ edit ]\n\nIn October 1997, the Spice Girls released the first single from Spiceworld, ""Spice Up Your Life"". It entered the UK Singles Chart at number one, making it the group\'s fifth consecutive number-one single.[54] That same month, the group performed their first live major concert to 40,000 fans in Istanbul, Turkey.[55] Later, they launched The Royal British Legion\'s Poppy Appeal,[56] then travelled to South Africa to meet Nelson Mandela, who announced, ""These are my heroes.""[57] In November, the Spice Girls released their second album, Spiceworld. It set a new record for the fastest-selling album when it shipped seven million copies over the course of two weeks. Gaining favourable reviews,[58] the album went on to sell over 10 million copies in Europe,[59] Canada,[60] and the United States[42] combined, and 13 million copies worldwide.[8] Criticised in the United States for releasing the album just nine months after their debut there, which gave the group two simultaneous Top 10 albums in the Billboard album charts,[61] and suffering from over-exposure at home,[56] the Spice Girls began to experience a media backlash. The group was criticised for the number of sponsorship deals signed\xe2\x80\x94over twenty in total\xe2\x80\x94and they began to witness diminishing international chart positions.[62] Nevertheless, the Spice Girls remained the biggest-selling pop group of both 1997 and 1998.[21]\n\nOn 7 November 1997, the group performed ""Spice Up Your Life"" in the 1997 MTV Europe Music Awards, and won the Best Group award.[63] After this performance, the Spice Girls made the decision to take over the running of the group themselves, and fired their manager Simon Fuller.[5] The firing was front-page news around the world. Many commentators speculated that Fuller had been the true mastermind behind the group, and that this was the moment when the band lost their impetus and direction.[64][65] Later that month, the Spice Girls became the first pop group to host ITV\'s An Audience with...;[66] their show was watched by 11.8 million viewers in the UK, one fifth of the population.[67] In December 1997, the second single from Spiceworld, ""Too Much"", was released, becoming the group\'s second Christmas number one and their sixth consecutive number-one single in the UK. The group ended 1997 as the year\'s most played artist on American radio.[68] At the 1998 American Music Awards on 26 January, the Spice Girls won the awards for Favorite Pop Album, Favorite New Artist and Favorite Pop Group.[69] In February 1998, they won a special award for overseas success at the 1998 Brit Awards, with combined sales of albums and singles for over of 45 million records worldwide.[70][71] That night, the group performed their next single, ""Stop"", their first not to reach number one in United Kingdom, entering at number two.[54]\n\n""Spice Up Your Life"" ""Spice Up Your Life"" became the group\'s fifth consecutive chart-topper, which made them the first act to have its first five singles reach number one in the UK. Problems playing this file? See media help.\n\nIn early 1998, the Spice Girls embarked on the Spiceworld Tour covering Europe and North America, starting in Dublin, Ireland on 24 February 1998 before moving to mainland Europe, and then returning to the United Kingdom for two gigs at Wembley Arena.[72] Later that year, the Spice Girls were invited to sing on the official England World Cup song ""How Does It Feel (To Be on Top of the World)"", the last song recorded with Halliwell until 2007. On 31 May 1998, Halliwell announced her departure from the Spice Girls through her solicitor.[73] Halliwell claimed that she was suffering from exhaustion and wanted to take a break. Rumours of a power struggle with Brown as the reason for her departure were circulated by the press.[10][74] Halliwell\'s departure from the group shocked fans and became one of the biggest entertainment news stories of the year, making news headlines the world over.[75] The four remaining members were adamant that the group would carry on.[73]\n\nHalliwell\'s departure was the subject of a lawsuit by Aprilia World Service B.V. (AWS), a manufacturer of motorcycles and scooters. On 9 March 1998, Halliwell informed the other members of the group of her intention to withdraw from the group, yet the girls signed an agreement with AWS on 24 March and again on 30 April and participated in a commercial photo shoot on 4 May in Milan, eventually concluding a contract with AWS on 6 May 1998. The Court of Appeal of England and Wales held that their conduct constituted a misrepresentation by giving the impression that Halliwell intended to remain part of the group in the foreseeable future, allowing AWS to rescind their contract with the Spice Girls. This is now the leading case in English law on misrepresentation by conduct.[76][77]\n\n""Viva Forever"" was the last single released from Spiceworld. The video for the single was made before Halliwell\'s departure and features the girls in stop-motion animated form. The North American tour began in West Palm Beach on 15 June, and grossed $60 million over 40 sold-out performances.[10]\n\n1998\xe2\x80\x932000: Forever and hiatus [ edit ]\n\nThe Spice Girls as a four-piece performing ""Holler"" in Cologne , Germany at the Return of the Spice Girls tour\n\nWhile on tour in the United-States, the group continued to record new material and released a new song, ""Goodbye"", before Christmas in 1998. The song was seen as a tribute to Geri Halliwell, and when it topped the UK Singles Chart it became their third consecutive Christmas number one\xe2\x80\x94equalling the record previously set by the Beatles.[78] Later in 1998, Bunton and Chisholm appeared at the 1998 MTV Europe Music Awards without their other band members, and the group won two awards: ""Best Pop Act"" and ""Best Group"" for a second time.[79] In late 1998, Brown and Adams announced they were both pregnant; Brown was married to dancer Jimmy Gulzer and became known as Mel G for a brief period. She gave birth to daughter Phoenix Chi in February 1999.[80] One month later, Adams gave birth to son Brooklyn, whose father was then Manchester United footballer David Beckham. Later that year, she married Beckham in a highly publicised wedding in Ireland.[81]\n\nThe Spice Girls returned to the studio in August 1999, after an eight-month recording break to start work on their third and last studio album. The album\'s sound was initially more pop-influenced, similar to their first two albums, and included production from Eliot Kennedy.[82] The album\'s sound took a mature direction when American producers like Rodney Jerkins, Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis came on to collaborate with the group. In December 1999 they performed live for a UK-only tour, Christmas in Spiceworld, in London and Manchester, also showcasing new songs from the third album.[83] During 1999, the group recorded the character Amneris\' song ""My Strongest Suit"" in Elton John\'s and Tim Rice\'s Aida, a concept album which would later go on to fuel the musical version of Verdi\'s Aida. The band performed again at the 2000 Brit Awards, where they received a Lifetime Achievement Award. Despite being at the event, Halliwell did not join her former bandmates on stage.[84] In November 2000, the group released Forever. Sporting a new edgier R&B sound, the album received a lukewarm response from critics.[85]\n\nIn the US, the album peaked at number thirty-nine on the Billboard 200 albums chart. In the UK, the album was released the same week as Westlife\'s Coast to Coast album and the chart battle was widely reported by the media, where Westlife won the battle reaching number one in the UK, leaving the Spice Girls at number two.[86] The lead single from Forever, the double A-side ""Holler""/""Let Love Lead the Way"", became the group\'s ninth number one single in the UK.[87] However, the song failed to break onto the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart stateside, instead peaking at number seven on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles. ""Holler"" did peak at number thirty-one on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart in 2000. The only major performance of the lead single came at the MTV Europe Music Awards on 16 November 2000.[88] In total, Forever achieved only a fraction of the success of its two best-selling predecessors, selling five million copies.[89] In January 2001, the group unofficially announced that they were beginning an indefinite hiatus and would be concentrating on their solo careers in regards to their foreseeable future, although they pointed out that the group was not splitting.[90][91]\n\n2007\xe2\x80\x932008: Return of the Spice Girls and Greatest Hits [ edit ]\n\nOn 28 June 2007, the group held a press conference at The O2 Arena revealing their intention to reunite.[92] The plan to re-form had long been speculated by the media,[93] but the group finally confirmed their intention to embark upon a worldwide concert tour, starting in Vancouver on 2 December 2007.[94] Filmmaker Bob Smeaton directed an official documentary on the reunion. It was entitled Spice Girls: Giving You Everything and was first aired on Australia\'s Fox8 on 16 December 2007,[95] followed by BBC One in the UK, on 31 December.[96] Ticket sales for the first London date of the Return of the Spice Girls tour sold out in 38 seconds.[97] It was reported that over one million people signed up in the UK alone and over five million worldwide for the ticket ballot on the band\'s official website.[97] Sixteen additional dates in London were added,[98] all selling out within one minute.[99] In the United States, Las Vegas, Los Angeles and San Jose shows also sold out, prompting additional dates to be added.[100] It was announced that the Spice Girls would be playing dates in Chicago and Detroit and Boston, as well as additional dates in New York to keep up with the demand. On the first concert in Canada, they performed to an audience of 15,000 people, singing twenty songs and changing a total of eight times.[101] Along with the tour sellout, the Spice Girls licensed their name and image to Tesco\'s UK supermarket chain.[102]\n\nThe group\'s comeback single, ""Headlines (Friendship Never Ends)"", was announced as the official Children in Need charity single for 2007 and was released 5 November. The first public appearance on stage by the Spice Girls occurred at the Victoria\'s Secret Fashion Show, where they performed two songs, 1998 single ""Stop"" and the lead single from their greatest hits album, ""Headlines (Friendship Never Ends)"". The show was filmed by CBS on 15 November 2007 for broadcast on 4 December 2007.[103] They also performed both songs live for the BBC Children in Need telethon on 16 November 2007 from Los Angeles. The release of ""Headlines (Friendship Never Ends)"" peaked at number eleven on the UK Singles Chart, making it the group\'s lowest-charting British single to date. The album peaked at number two on the UK Albums Chart. On 1 February 2008, it was announced that due to personal and family commitments their tour would come to an end in Toronto on 26 February 2008, meaning that tour dates in Beijing, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Sydney, Cape Town and Buenos Aires were cancelled.[104] Overall, the tour produced some $107.2 million in ticket sales and merchandising, with sponsorship and ad deals bringing the total to $200 million.[105] In March 2008, the group won the coveted ""Icon Awards"" at the 95.8 Capital Awards; Bunton and Chisholm collected the award. In June, they captured the Glamour Award for the Best Band; Bunton, Brown and Halliwell received the award at the event. In September, the Spice Girls won the ""Best Live Return Award"" at the 2008 Live Vodafone Music Awards, beating acts such as Led Zeppelin and the Sex Pistols. Bunton was there to collect the award.[106]\n\n2010\xe2\x80\x932012: Viva Forever musical and London Olympics [ edit ]\n\nViva Forever! premiere night, 2012 The Spice Girls at thepremiere night, 2012\n\nIn 2010, the group was nominated for a Brit Award in the new category, ""Best Performance of the 30th Year"" for their 1997 Brit Awards performance of their songs, ""Wannabe"" and ""Who Do You Think You Are"". The group later won the award which was received by Halliwell and Brown. The group along with Simon Fuller also teamed with Judy Craymer and Jennifer Saunders to develop a Spice Girls musical, Viva Forever!. Although the group were not in the musical, they influenced the show\'s cast and production choices in a story which uses the music, similar to ABBA\'s music in Mamma Mia!.[107]\n\nTwo years later, in June 2012, the group reunited for the first time in four years for the press conference in London to promote the launch of Viva Forever!.[108] The press conference was held at St. Pancras Renaissance London Hotel, the location where the group filmed the music video for ""Wannabe"", sixteen years earlier, to the day.[109] In August 2012, after much speculation and anticipation from the press and the public, the group performed a medley of ""Wannabe"" and ""Spice Up Your Life"" at the 2012 Summer Olympics closing ceremony, reuniting solely for the event.[110][111] Their performance received great response from critics and audiences and became the most tweeted moment of the entire Olympics with over 116,000 tweets on Twitter per minute.[112] In December 2012, the group reunited once again for the premiere of Viva Forever! at the West End\'s Piccadilly Theatre.[113] In addition to the promotion of the musical, the group appeared in the documentary, Spice Girls\' Story: Viva Forever! which aired on 24 December 2012 on ITV1.[114]\n\n2016\xe2\x80\x93present: Second reunion [ edit ]\n\nOn 8 July 2016, Brown, Bunton and Halliwell released a video celebrating the 20th anniversary of their first single ""Wannabe"", alongside a website under the name ""The Spice Girls - GEM"" and teased news from them as a three-piece.[115] Brown later clarified that ""GEM"" was not a new name for the three-piece but rather simply the name of the website.[116] Beckham and Chisholm opted not to take part in a reunion project, with Brown reaffirming their positions in saying, ""Victoria\'s busy [...] Mel C\'s doing her own album"" and noted that both members gave the three-piece their blessing to continue with the project.[117] On 23 November 2016, a new song, ""Song for Her"", was leaked online.[118] Following Halliwell\'s announcement of her pregnancy, the project was cancelled.[119]\n\nOn 5 November 2018, Brown, Bunton, Chisholm and Halliwell announced a tour for 2019. Beckham declined to join due to commitments regarding her fashion business.[120][121] The Spice World \xe2\x80\x93 2019 Tour commenced at Croke Park in Dublin, Ireland on 24 May 2019.[122] A 13 date European tour, it concluded with three concerts at London\'s Wembley Stadium, with the last taking place on 15 June 2019.[123] The tour produced 700,000 spectators and earned $78.2 million.[124][125] Despite sound problems in the early concerts, Anna Nicholson in The Guardian writes, ""As nostalgia tours go, this could hardly have been bettered. Victoria\'s dry wit was missed, but some passive-aggressive patter and a food fight is how you really sell a tour.""[126]\n\nOn 30 April 2019, the group teamed up with the children\'s book franchise Mr. Men, in order to create many derivative products such as books, cups, bags and coasters.[127][128][129] On 13 June 2019, it was reported that Paramount Animation president Mireille Soria had green lit an animated film based on the group, with all five members returning. The project will be produced by Simon Fuller, with Karen McCullah and Kirsten Smith writing the screenplay, and will feature both previous and original songs.[130] The film will feature the band as superheroes. A director has not yet been announced.[131]\n\nCultural impact and legacy [ edit ]\n\nPop music scene [ edit ]\n\nIn addition to their global success, The Spice Girls became the biggest act of the 1990s in the UK charts , achieving eight of their nine number-one singles in this decade.\n\nThe Spice Girls broke onto the music scene at a time when alternative rock, hip-hop and R&B dominated global music charts. The modern pop phenomenon that the Spice Girls created by targeting early members of Generation Y was credited with changing the global music landscape,[132][133][134] bringing about the global wave of late-1990s and early-2000s teen pop acts such as Hanson, Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera and NSYNC.[135][136][137][138]\n\nThe Spice Girls have also been credited with paving the way for the girl groups and female pop singers that have come after them.[139][140][141] In the UK, they are credited for their massive commercial breakthrough in the previously male-dominated pop music scene,[141][142] leading to the widespread formation of new girl groups in the late 1990s and early 2000s including All Saints, B*Witched, Atomic Kitten, Girls Aloud and Sugababes, hoping to emulate the Spice Girls\' success.[143][144][145] Twenty-first-century girl groups, including the Pussycat Dolls,[146] 2NE1,[147] Girls\' Generation,[148] Little Mix[149][150] and Fifth Harmony,[151] continue to cite the group as a major source of influence, as have female singers, including Lady Gaga,[152] Jess Glynne,[153] Alexandra Burke,[153] Kim Petras,[154] Charli XCX,[155][156] Rita Ora,[157] Demi Lovato[158] and Carly Rae Jepsen.[159] During her 2005 ""Reflections"" concert series, Filipina superstar Regine Velasquez performed a medley of Spice Girls songs consisting of ""Wannabe"", ""Say You\'ll Be There"", ""2 Become 1"", ""Who Do You Think You Are"" and ""Holler"", as a tribute to the band she says were a major influence on her music.[160] Danish singer-songwriter M\xc3\x98 decided to pursue music after watching the Spice Girls on TV as a child, saying in a 2014 interview: ""I have them and only them to thank\xe2\x80\x94or to blame\xe2\x80\x94for becoming a singer.""[161] 15-time Grammy Award-winning singer-songwriter Adele credits the Spice Girls as a major influence in regard to her love and passion for music, stating that ""they made me what I am today"".[162][163]\n\nGirl power [ edit ]\n\nThe phrase ""girl power"" put a name to a social phenomenon, but the slogan was met with mixed reactions.[164] The phrase was a label for the particular facet of post classical neo-feminist empowerment embraced by the band: that a sensual, feminine appearance and equality between the sexes need not be mutually exclusive. This concept was by no means original in the pop world: both Madonna and Bananarama had employed similar outlooks. The phrase itself had also appeared in a few songs by British girl groups and bands since at least 1987; most notably, it was the name of British pop duo Shampoo\'s 1996 single and album, later credited by Halliwell as the inspiration for the Spice Girls\' mantra.[22][165] In a Christmas 1996 interview with The Spectator magazine, Halliwell spoke of former UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher as being an inspiration for the group: ""We are true Thatcherites. Thatcher was the first Spice Girl, the pioneer of our ideology.""[166]\n\nBillboard states it was among the songs where ""they embraced their sexuality"".[167] Beckham and Bunton in Las Vegas Nevada , on 11 December 2007, performing ""2 Become 1"". Addressing the importance of contraception, Jennifer Keishin Armstrong instates it was among the songs where ""they embraced their sexuality"".\n\nHowever, it was not until the emergence of the Spice Girls in 1996 with ""Wannabe"", that the concept of ""girl power"" exploded onto the common consciousness.[167] The phrase was regularly uttered by all five members\xe2\x80\x94although most closely associated with Halliwell\xe2\x80\x94and was often delivered with a peace sign.[168] The slogan also featured on official Spice Girls merchandise and on some of the outfits the group members wore. The Spice Girls\' version was distinctive. Its message of empowerment appealed to young girls, adolescents and adult women,[169][164] and it emphasised the importance of strong and loyal friendship among females.[170][171] According to Billboard magazine, they demonstrated real, noncompetitive female friendship, singing: ""If you wannabe my lover, you gotta get with my friends. Make it last forever; friendship never ends.""[167]\n\nIn all, the focused, consistent presentation of ""girl power"" formed the centrepiece of their appeal as a band.[164][172] Some commentators credit the Spice Girls with reinvigorating mainstream feminism\xe2\x80\x94popularised as ""girl power""\xe2\x80\x94in the 1990s,[173][174] with their mantra serving as a gateway to feminism for their young fans.[171][175] On the other hand, some critics dismissed it as no more than a shallow marketing tactic, while others took issue with the emphasis on physical appearance, concerned about the potential impact on self-conscious and/or impressionable youngsters.[169] Regardless, the phrase became a cultural phenomenon,[176] adopted as the mantra for millions of girls[164][171] and even making it into the Oxford English Dictionary.[177] In summation of the concept, author Ryan Dawson said, ""The Spice Girls changed British culture enough for Girl Power to now seem completely unremarkable.""[13]\n\nThe Spice Girls\' debut single ""Wannabe"" has been hailed as an ""iconic girl power anthem"".[133][178][179] In 2016, the United Nations\' Global Goals ""#WhatIReallyReallyWant"" campaign filmed a global remake of the original music video for ""Wannabe"" to highlight gender inequality issues faced by women across the world. The video, which was launched on YouTube and ran in movie theatres internationally,[180] featured British girl group M.O, Canadian ""viral sensation"" Taylor Hatala, Nigerian-British singer Seyi Shay and Bollywood actress Jacqueline Fernandez lip-syncing to the song in various locations around the world.[181] In response to the remake, Beckham said, ""How fabulous is it that after 20 years the legacy of the Spice Girls\' girl power is being used to encourage and empower a whole new generation?""[180]\n\nAt the 43rd People\'s Choice Awards in January 2017, American actress Blake Lively dedicated her ""Favorite Dramatic Movie Actress"" award to ""girl power"" in her acceptance speech, and credited the Spice Girls, saying: ""What was so neat about them was that they\'re all so distinctly different, and they were women, and they owned who they were, and that was my first introduction into girl power.""[182] In 2018, Rolling Stone named the Spice Girls\' girl power on The Millennial 100, a list of 100 people, music, cultural touchstones and movements that have shaped a generation (those born between 1980 and 1995).[183]\n\nCool Britannia [ edit ]\n\nThe term ""Cool Britannia"" became prominent in the media and represented the new political and social climate that was emerging with the advances made by New Labour and the new UK Prime Minister Tony Blair. Coming out of a period of 18 years of Conservative government, Tony Blair and New Labour were seen as young, cool and appealing, a driving force in giving Britain a feeling of euphoria and optimism.[184]\n\nAlthough by no means responsible for the onset of ""Cool Britannia"", the arrival of the Spice Girls added to the new image and re-branding of Britain, and underlined the growing world popularity of British, rather than American, pop music. This fact was underlined at the 1997 Brit Awards; the group won two awards[185] but it was Halliwell\'s iconic red, white and blue Union Jack mini-dress that appeared in media coverage around the world, becoming an enduring image of ""Cool Britannia"".[47][186] In 2016, Time acknowledged the Spice Girls as ""arguably the most recognisable face"" of ""Cool Britannia"".[3]\n\nFashion trends, image and nicknames [ edit ]\n\nThe Spice Girls are considered style icons of the 1990s; their image and styles becoming inextricably tied to the band\'s identity.[187][188][189] They are credited with setting 1990s fashion trends such as Buffalo platform shoes and double bun hairstyles.[191][192] The group have also been noted for the memorable outfits they have worn, the most iconic being Halliwell\'s Union Jack dress from the 1997 Brit Awards.[193] The dress was sold at a charity auction to the Las Vegas Hard Rock Cafe for \xc2\xa341,320, giving Halliwell the Guinness World Record at that time for the most expensive piece of pop star clothing ever sold.[194][195] Their style has inspired other celebrities including Katy Perry,[196] Charli XCX,[197] Billie Eilish,[198] and Bollywood actress Anushka Ranjan.[199]\n\nThe Spice Girls\' image was deliberately aimed at young girls, an audience of formidable size and potential. Instrumental to their range of appeal within the target demographic were the bandmates\' five divergent personalities and styles, which encouraged fans to identify with one member or another and were a departure from previous bands.[169][200] This marketing of each member\'s individuality was reinforced by the distinctive nicknames adopted by each member of the group. Their concept of each band member having a distinct style identity has been influential to later teen pop groups such as boy band One Direction.[201][202]\n\nShortly after ""Wannabe""\'s release, a lunch with Peter Loraine, then-editor of Top of the Pops, inadvertently led the Spice Girls to adopt the nicknames that ultimately played a key role in their marketability and the way their international audience identified with them. After the lunch, Loraine and his editorial staff decided to devise nicknames for each member of the group based on their personalities. In an interview with Music Week, Loraine explained that, ""In the magazine we used silly language and came up with nicknames all the time so it came naturally to give them names that would be used by the magazine and its readers; it was never meant to be adopted globally."" Shortly after using the nicknames in a magazine feature on the group, Loraine received calls from other British media outlets requesting permission to use them, and before long the nicknames were synonymous with the Spice Girls.[203]\n\nEach Spice Girl had a unique, over-the-top style that served as an extension of her public persona, becoming her trademark look.[187][204]\n\nIn their one-off reunion at the 2012 Summer Olympics closing ceremony, the Spice Girls performed in updated high fashion versions of their signature outfits,[111] after entering the Olympic Stadium in five black cabs which lit up with LEDs, each decorated with their individual trademark emblems (Posh: sparkling black, Sporty: racing stripes, Scary: leopard print, Baby: pink and Ginger: the Union Jack).[211]\n\nCommercialisation and celebrity culture [ edit ]\n\nAt the height of ""Spice mania"", the group were involved in a prolific marketing phenomenon.[212][213][214][215] Under the guidance of their mentor and manager Simon Fuller, they advertised for an unprecedented number of brands, becoming the most merchandised group in music history,[165][216] and were a frequent feature of the global press.[214][217]\n\nAccording to Rolling Stone\'s David Sinclair, ""So great was the daily bombardment of Spice images and Spice product that it quickly became oppressive even to people who were well disposed towards the group.""[218] This was even parodied in the video for their song ""Spice Up Your Life"", which depicts the group going around a futuristic dystopian city in a space ship surrounded by billboards and adverts featuring them. Throughout the American leg of their 1998 Spiceworld world tour, commercials were played on large concert screens before the shows and during intermissions. It was the first time advertising had been used in pop concerts and was met with mixed reactions in the music industry. Nevertheless, it opened up a whole new concert revenue stream, with music industry pundits predicting more acts would follow the Spice Girls\' lead.[219][220]\n\nIn his analysis of the group\'s influence on 21st-century popular culture two decades after their debut, John Mckie of the BBC noted that while other stars had used brand endorsements in the past, ""the Spice brand was the first to propel the success of the band"".[169] The Guardian\'s Sylvia Patterson also wrote of what she called the Spice Girls\' true legacy: ""[T]hey were the original pioneers of the band as brand, of pop as a ruthless marketing ruse, of the merchandising and sponsorship deals that have dominated commercial pop ever since.""[137]\n\nThe mainstream media embraced the Spice Girls at the peak of their success. The group received regular international press coverage and were constantly followed by paparazzi.[221] Paul Gorman of Music Week said of the media interest in the Spice Girls in the late 1990s: ""They inaugurated the era of cheesy celebrity obsession which pertains today. There is lineage from them to the Kardashianisation not only of the music industry, but the wider culture.""[169] The Irish Independent\'s Tanya Sweeney agreed that ""[t]he vapidity of paparazzi culture could probably be traced back to the Spice Girls\' naked ambitions"",[172] while Mckie predicted that, ""[f]or all that modern stars from Katy Perry to Lionel Messi exploit brand endorsements and attract tabloid coverage, the scale of the Spice Girls\' breakthrough in 1996 is unlikely to be repeated\xe2\x80\x94at least not by a music act.""[169]\n\n1990s icons [ edit ]\n\nThe Spice Girls have been labelled the biggest pop phenomenon of the 1990s[2][15] due to their international record sales, iconic symbolism and ""omnipresence"" in the late 1990s.[187][214][222] The group appeared on the cover of the July 1997 edition of Rolling Stone accompanied with the headline, ""Spice Girls Conquer the World"".[223] At the 2000 Brit Awards, the group received the Outstanding Contribution to Music Award to mark their success in the global music scene in the 1990s.[224] The iconic symbolism of the Spice Girls in the 1990s is partly attributed to their era-defining outfits,[187] the most notable being the Union Jack dress that Geri Halliwell wore at the 1997 Brit Awards. The dress has achieved iconic status, becoming one of the most prominent symbols of 1990s pop culture.[225] The status of the Spice Girls as 1990s pop icons is also attributed to their vast merchandising and willingness to be a part of a media-driven world.[169] Their unprecedented appearances in adverts and the media solidified the group as a phenomenon\xe2\x80\x94an icon of the decade and for British music.[1][141]\n\nSome sources, especially those in the United Kingdom, regard the Spice Girls as gay icons.[226][227] In a UK survey of more than 5,000 gay men and women, Victoria Beckham placed 12th and Halliwell placed 43rd in a ranking of the Top 50 gay icons of all time.[228] Halliwell was also the recipient of the Honorary Gay Award at the 2016 Attitude Awards.[229] In a 2005 interview, Emma Bunton attributed their large gay fan base to the group\'s fun-loving nature, open-mindedness and their love of fashion and dressing up, concluding that: ""I\'m so flattered that we\'ve got such a huge gay following, it\'s amazing.""[230]\n\nIn 1999, a study conducted by the British Council found that the Spice Girls were the second-best-known Britons internationally\xe2\x80\x94only behind then-Prime Minister Tony Blair\xe2\x80\x94and the best-known Britons in Asia.[231][232] In 2004, they featured in the VH1 series I Love the \'90s for the year 1997, which was broadcast in the United States.[233] In 2005, Emma Bunton was a presenter on the VH1 sequel, I Love the \'90s: Part Deux, with 1998 covering Geri Halliwell\'s exit from the group.[234] In 2006, ten years after the release of their debut single, the Spice Girls were voted the biggest cultural icons of the 1990s with 80 per cent of the votes in a UK poll of 1,000 people carried out for the board game Trivial Pursuit, stating that ""Girl Power"" defined the decade.[222][235] The Spice Girls also ranked number ten in the E! TV special, The 101 Reasons the \'90s Ruled.[236]\n\nPortrayal in the media [ edit ]\n\nThe Spice Girls became media icons in Great Britain and a regular feature of the British press.[217][237] During the peak of their worldwide fame in 1997, the paparazzi were constantly seen following them everywhere[221] to obtain stories and gossip about the group, as a supposed affair between Emma Bunton and manager Simon Fuller, or constant split rumours which became fodder for numerous tabloids.[237][238][239][240] Rumours of in-fighting and conflicts within the group also made headlines, with the rumours suggesting that Geri Halliwell and Melanie Brown in particular were fighting to be the leader of the group.[9] Brown, who later admitted that she used to be a ""bitch"" to Halliwell, said the problems had stayed in the past.[241] The rumours reached their height when the Spice Girls dismissed their manager Simon Fuller during the power struggles, with Fuller reportedly receiving a \xc2\xa310 million severance cheque to keep quiet about the details of his sacking.[9][239][240] Months later, in May 1998, Halliwell would leave the band amid rumours of a falling out with Brown; the news of Halliwell\'s departure was covered as a major news story by media around the world,[242] and became one of the biggest entertainment news stories of the decade.[243]\n\nIn February 1997 at the Brit Awards, Halliwell\'s Union Jack dress from the Spice Girls\' live performance made all the front pages the next day. During the ceremony, Halliwell\'s breasts were exposed twice, causing controversy.[16] In the same year, nude glamour shots of Halliwell taken earlier in her career were released,[237] causing some scandal.[217] According to the group\'s official documentary Giving You Everything, the rest of the group had been fully aware of Halliwell\'s glamour modelling past, but the photos still created friction inside the group when they were published.\n\nThe stories of their encounters with other celebrities also became fodder for the press;[237][244] for example, in May 1997, at The Prince\'s Trust 21st-anniversary concert, Mel B and Geri Halliwell breached royal protocol when they planted kisses on Prince Charles\'s cheeks, leaving it covered with lipstick, and later, Halliwell told him ""you\'re very sexy"" and also pinched his bottom.[245] In November, the British royal family were considered fans of the Spice Girls, including The Prince of Wales and his sons Prince William and Prince Harry.[246][247][248] That month, South African President Nelson Mandela said: ""These are my heroes. This is one of the greatest moments in my life""[249] in an encounter organised by Prince Charles, who said, ""It is the second greatest moment in my life, the first time I met them was the greatest"".[249] Prince Charles would later send Halliwell a personal letter ""with lots of love"" when he heard that she had quit the Spice Girls.[245] In 1998 the video game magazine Nintendo Power created The More Annoying Than the Spice Girls Award, adding: ""What could possibly have been more annoying in 1997 than the Spice Girls, you ask?"".[250]\n\nVictoria Adams started dating football player David Beckham in late 1997 after they had met at a charity football match.[251] The couple announced their engagement in 1998[252] and were dubbed ""Posh and Becks"" by the media, becoming a cultural phenomenon in their own right.[253]\n\nOther brand ventures [ edit ]\n\nFilm [ edit ]\n\nSpice World (1997) The Spice Girls\' bus used in the film(1997)\n\nIn June 1997, the group began filming their movie debut with director Bob Spiers. Meant to accompany the album, the comical style and content of the movie was in the same vein as the Beatles\' films in the 1960s such as A Hard Day\'s Night. The light-hearted comedy, intended to capture the spirit of the Spice Girls, featured a plethora of stars including Roger Moore, Hugh Laurie, Stephen Fry, Elton John, Richard O\'Brien, Bob Hoskins, Jennifer Saunders, Richard E. Grant, Elvis Costello and Meat Loaf.[254]\n\nReleased in December 1997, Spiceworld: The Movie proved to be a hit at the box office, breaking the record for the highest-ever weekend debut for Super Bowl Weekend (25 January 1998) in the US, with box office sales of $10,527,222. The movie took in a total of $151 million at the box office worldwide.[9] Despite being a commercial success, the film was widely panned by critics; the movie was nominated for seven awards at the 1999 Golden Raspberry Awards where the Spice Girls collectively won the award for ""Worst Actress"". Since 18 July 2014, the Spice Bus, which was driven by Meat Loaf in the film, is now on permanent display at the Island Harbour Marina on the Isle of Wight, England.[255]\n\nConsidered a cult film, many publications described it as a brilliant film of the parody genre, that mocks both the star system and clich\xc3\xa9s of the cinema, while giving many winks to popular culture of the time.[256][257][258][259][260]\n\nTelevision [ edit ]\n\nThe Spice Girls have starred in several television specials, documentaries and commercials since their debut in 1996. They have hosted various television specials. In November 1997, the Spice Girls became the first pop group to host ITV\'s An Audience with...;[66] their show featured an all-female audience and was watched by 11.8 million viewers in the UK, one fifth of the country\'s total population.[67] They have also hosted Christmas Eve and Christmas Day Top of the Pops television specials on BBC One.[261][262] Concert specials of their 1997 Girl Power! Live in Istanbul,[263] 1998 Spiceworld Tour[264] and 1999 Christmas in Spiceworld tours were also broadcast in various countries.\n\nThe Spice Girls have released at least seven official behind-the-scenes television documentaries, including two tour documentaries and two making-of documentaries for their film Spice World. They have also been the subject of a number of unofficial documentaries, commissioned and produced by individuals independent of the group. These documentaries usually focus on the group\'s career and their cultural impact. The Spice Girls have had episodes dedicated to them in several music biography series, including VH1\'s Behind the Music, E! True Hollywood Story and MTV\'s BioRhythm. The Spice Girls have appeared and performed in numerous television shows and events. Notable appearances include Saturday Night Live (SNL), The Oprah Winfrey Show, two Royal Variety Performances and the 2012 Summer Olympics closing ceremony. The group has also starred in television commercials for brands including Pepsi (where they sang ""Move Over"", given the additional subtitle ""Generationext"" which is a prominent lyric in the song), Polaroid, Walkers Crisps, Impulse and Tesco.[265]\n\nViva Forever! [ edit ]\n\nA jukebox musical written by Jennifer Saunders, produced by Judy Craymer and directed by Paul Garrington. Based on the songs of the Spice Girls, the show began previews at the Piccadilly Theatre in the West End on 27 November 2012 and had its Press Night on 11 December 2012 and features some of the group\'s biggest hit songs including ""Wannabe"", ""Spice Up Your Life"" and the eponymous ""Viva Forever"".[266]\n\nIn 1997, the Spice Girls were involved in a prolific merchandising phenomenon, becoming the most merchandised group in music history[216] with estimated earnings of over \xc2\xa3300 million from their merchandising and endorsement deals that year alone.[267] They negotiated lucrative deals with many brands, including Pepsi, Asda, Cadbury and Target, which led to accusations of ""selling out"" and overexposure.[62] The group responded to the press\' criticisms by launching the music video for ""Spice Up Your Life"" in which they parody the number of sponsorships they had. In their 2019 reunion, they teamed up with the children\'s book franchise Mr. Men, creating many derivative products such as books, cups, bags and coasters.[268][269][270]\n\nIn conjunction with the beginning of the Spice World \xe2\x80\x93 2019 Tour, the Spice Girls launched an advertising campaign with Walkers potato crisps who they had previously worked with in the 1990s.[271] The campaign was to find their ""best-ever fan"" and included Spice Girls branded products in supermarkets to promote their ""best-ever"" Cheese & Onion flavouring and a television advertisement which was premiered during a commercial break for 2019\'s Britain\'s Got Talent semi-finals.[272] The ""best-ever fan"" would receive the chance to meet the Spice Girls on a date of their tour.[273]\n\nCareer records and achievements [ edit ]\n\nAs a group, the Spice Girls have received a number of notable awards including five Brit Awards, three American Music Awards, three MTV Europe Music Awards, one MTV Video Music Award and three World Music Awards. In 2000, they received the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to the British Music Industry, previous winners include Elton John, the Beatles and Queen. They have sold 85 million records worldwide,[274][275] achieving certified sales of 13 million albums in Europe,[40] 14 million records in the US[42] and 2.4 million in Canada.[60] The group achieved the highest-charting debut for a UK group on the Billboard Hot 100 at number five with ""Say You\'ll Be There"". They are also the first British band since the Rolling Stones in 1975 to have two top-ten albums in the US Billboard 200 albums chart at the same time (Spice and Spiceworld).[61] In addition to this, the Spice Girls also achieved the highest-ever annual earnings by an all-female group in 1998 with an income of \xc2\xa329.6 million (approximately US$49 million).[276] In 1999, they were ranked sixth in Forbes\' inaugural Celebrity 100 Power Ranking.[277]\n\nThey produced a total of nine number one singles in the UK\xe2\x80\x94tied with ABBA behind Take That (eleven), The Shadows (twelve), Madonna (thirteen), Westlife (fourteen), Cliff Richard (fourteen), the Beatles (seventeen) and Elvis Presley (twenty-one). The group had three consecutive Christmas number-one singles in the UK (""2 Become 1"", 1996; ""Too Much"", 1997; ""Goodbye"", 1998); they only share this record with the Beatles.[278] Their first single, ""Wannabe"", is the most successful song released by an all-female group.[25][194] Debuting on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart at number eleven, it is also the highest-ever-charting debut by a British band in the US, beating the previous record held by the Beatles for ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" and the joint highest entry for a debut act, tying with Alanis Morissette.[16]\n\nSpice is the 18th-biggest-selling album of all time in the UK with over 3 million copies sold, and topped the charts for 15 non-consecutive weeks, the most by a female group in the UK.[38] It is also the biggest-selling album of all time by a girl group, with sales of over 23 million copies worldwide.[7] Spiceworld shipped 7 million copies in just two weeks, including 1.4 million in Britain alone\xe2\x80\x94the largest-ever shipment of an album over 14 days.[279] They are also the first act (and so far only female act) to have their first six singles (""Wannabe"", ""Say You\'ll Be There"", ""2 Become 1"", ""Mama""/""Who Do You Think You Are"", ""Spice Up Your Life"" and ""Too Much"") make number one on the UK charts. (Their run was broken by ""Stop"", which peaked at number two in March 1998.)\n\nSpiceworld: The Movie broke the record for the highest-ever weekend debut a film on Super Bowl weekend (25 January 1998) in the US, with box office sales of $10,527,222. Spiceworld: The Movie topped the UK video charts on its first week of release, selling over 55,000 copies on its first day in stores and 270,000 copies in the first week.[280][281] The Return of the Spice Girls Tour was announced as the highest-grossing concert act of 2008, measured as the twelve months ended April 2008.[99] The 17-night sellout stand at the O 2 Arena in London was the highest-grossing engagement of the year, netting \xc2\xa316.5 million (US$33 million) for the group and drawing an audience of 256,647, winning the 2008 Billboard Touring Award for Top Boxscore.[282][283] In total, the 47-date tour took in more than $70 million[284] and produced $107.2 million in ticket sales and merchandising.[105] The 3-night sellout stand at Wembley Stadium for the Spice World \xe2\x80\x93 2019 Tour was the highest-grossing engagement of the year drawing an audience of 221,971, winning the 2019 Billboard Live Music Award for Top Boxscore.[285]\n\nIn popular culture [ edit ]\n\nSpice World at the Geri Halliwell\'s swimsuit fromat the Hard Rock Cafe in Tokyo, Japan\n\nIn February 1997, the ""Sugar Lumps"", a satirical version of the Spice Girls played by Kathy Burke, Dawn French, Llewella Gideon, Lulu and Jennifer Saunders, filmed a video for British charity Comic Relief. The video starts with the Sugar Lumps as schoolgirls who really want to become pop stars like the Spice Girls, and ends with them joining the group on stage, while dancing and lip-syncing the song ""Who Do You Think You Are"".[286] The Sugar Lumps later joined the Spice Girls during their live performance of the song on Comic Relief\'s telethon Red Nose Day event in March 1997.[287] In January 1998, a fight between animated versions of the Spice Girls and pop band Hanson was the headlining matchup in MTV\'s claymation parody Celebrity Deathmatch Deathbowl \'98 special that aired during the Super Bowl XXXII halftime.[288][289] The episode became the highest-rated special in the network\'s history and MTV turned the concept into a full-fledged television series soon after.[290]\n\nIn March 2013, the Glee characters Brittany (Heather Morris), Tina (Jenna Ushkowitz), Marley (Melissa Benoist), Kitty (Becca Tobin) and Unique (Alex Newell) dressed up as the Spice Girls and performed the song ""Wannabe"" on the 17th episode of the fourth season of the show.[291] In April 2016, the Italian variety show Laura & Paola on Rai 1 featured the hosts, Grammy Award-winning singer Laura Pausini and actress Paola Cortellesi, and their guests, Francesca Michielin, Margherita Buy and Claudia Gerini, dressed up as the Spice Girls to perform a medley of Spice Girls songs as part of a 20th-anniversary tribute to the band.[292][293] In December 2016, the episode ""Who Needs Josh When You Have a Girl Group?"" of the musical comedy-drama series Crazy Ex-Girlfriend featured cast members Rachel Bloom, Gabrielle Ruiz and Vella Lovell performing an original song titled ""Friendtopia"", a parody of the Spice Girls\' songs and ""girl power"" philosophy.[294][295] Rapper Amin\xc3\xa9\'s 2017 single ""Spice Girl"" is a reference to the group, and the song\'s music video includes an appearance by Mel B.[296]\n\nIn the late 1990s, Spice Girls parodies appeared in various American sketch comedy shows including Saturday Night Live (SNL), Mad TV[297] and All That. A January 1998 episode of SNL featured cast members, including guest host Sarah Michelle Gellar, impersonating the Spice Girls for two ""An Important Message About ..."" sketches.[298] In September 1998, the show once again featured cast members, including guest host Cameron Diaz, impersonating the Spice Girls for a sketch titled ""A Message from the Spice Girls"".[299][300] Nickelodeon\'s All That had recurring sketches with the fictional boy band ""The Spice Boys"", featuring cast members Nick Cannon as ""Sweaty Spice"", Kenan Thompson as ""Spice Cube"", Danny Tamberelli as ""Hairy Spice"", Josh Server as ""Mumbly Spice"", and a skeleton prop as ""Dead Spice"".[301]\n\nParodies of the Spice Girls have also appeared in major advertising campaigns. In 1997, Jack in the Box, an American fast-food chain restaurant, sought to capitalise on ""Spice mania"" in America by launching a national television campaign using a fictional girl group called the Spicy Crispy Chicks (a take off of the Spice Girls) to promote the new Spicy Crispy Sandwich. The Spicy Crispy Chicks concept was used as a model for another successful advertising campaign called the \'Meaty Cheesy Boys\'.[139][302] At the 1998 Association of Independent Commercial Producers (AICP) Show, one of the Spicy Crispy Chicks commercials won the top award for humour.[303] In 2001, prints adverts featuring a parody of the Spice Girls, along with other British music icons consisting of the Beatles, Elton John, Freddie Mercury and the Rolling Stones, were used in the Eurostar national advertising campaign in France. The campaign won the award for Best Outdoor Campaign at the French advertising CDA awards.[304][305] In September 2016, an Apple Music advert premiered during the 68th Primetime Emmy Awards that featured comedian James Corden dressed up as various music icons including all five of the Spice Girls.[306]\n\nOther notable groups of people have been labelled as some variation of a play-on-words on the Spice Girls\' name as an allusion to the band. In 1997, the term ""Spice Boys"" emerged in the British media as a term coined to characterise the ""pop star"" antics and lifestyles off the pitch of a group of Liverpool F.C. footballers that includes Jamie Redknapp, David James, Steve McManaman, Robbie Fowler and Jason McAteer.[307] The label has stuck with these footballers ever since, with John Scales, one of the so-called Spice Boys, admitting in 2015 that, ""We\'re the Spice Boys and it\'s something we have to accept because it will never change.""[308] In the Philippines, the ""Spice Boys"" tag was given to a group of young Congressmen of the House of Representatives who initiated the impeachment of President Joseph Estrada in 2001.[309][310] The Australian/British string quartet Bond were dubbed by the international press as the ""Spice Girls of classical music"" during their launch in 2000 due to their ""sexy"" image and classical crossover music that incorporated elements of pop and dance music. A spokeswoman for the quartet said in response to the comparisons, ""In fact, they are much better looking than the Spice Girls. But we don\'t welcome comparisons.

"b'Find out which Hollywood actress turned down the lead role in Pretty Woman By Sharnaz Shahid\n\nJulia Roberts\xe2\x80\x99s life-changing role in Pretty Woman was almost played by a different actress! Diane Lane has revealed she was originally tipped to play the role of Vivian Ward in the film but was forced to turn it down due to ""conflicting schedules"". During an appearance on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen, the 52-year-old confessed the role was highly popular and that ""every actress in town"" auditioned for it.\n\n""Everybody in town went for that role. At that time - as I\'ve said on other shows \xe2\x80\x93 it\'s true, it was a very different [film],"" she explained. ""It kind of got Disney-fied and it turned out to be a feel good movie. Originally, this crazy [woman] was kicked out of a rolling limo in the end because she was delusional that she thought this guy was in love with her. She was only hired for the weekend. And we had such compassion for her."" She later teased: ""I think that movie needs to get made. I want to direct it, let\'s make it happen.""\n\nThe Hollywood film was originally pitched as a cautionary tale of drug use, but after Disney and director Gary Marshall came on board, the film became more light-hearted. Julia, who played Vivian, had to re-audition and luckily landed the part again before screen-testing with male actors to find her leading man. Other stars such as Al Pacino and Michelle Pfeiffer also went for the lead roles.\n\nGarry, who passed away last year, confessed the movie would of went in a completely different direction if he didn\'t cast Richard Gere and his leading lady Julia. He told Vanity Fair: ""It would definitely have been a different movie if had it been Al Pacino and Michelle Pfeiffer. It might have been closer to the original script and maybe not have had a happy ending. But the chemistry between Julia and Richard, it is palpable on the screen, it was palpable in auditions. You can\xe2\x80\x99t really see how it could end any other way, because they just light up with each other.""'"
"b'This article is about the American television show. For other uses, see Fear factor (disambiguation)\n\nFear Factor was an American stunt/dare game show that first aired on NBC from 2001 to 2006 and was initially hosted by comedian and UFC commentator Joe Rogan. The show was adapted from the original Dutch version Now or Neverland and renamed Fear Factor by Endemol USA and NBC for the American market. The show has spawned many spin-offs, creating the Fear Factor franchise.\n\nThe show pits contestants against each other in a variety of three stunts for a grand prize, usually of $50,000. From the first to fifth season, the contestants consisted regularly of three men and three women who were competing for themselves. In the sixth season, the show\'s format was modified to feature four competing teams of two people who have a pre-existing relationship with one another.\n\nFear Factor was cancelled by NBC in 2006, briefly revived in 2011 and then cancelled again in 2012. It was revived for a second time in 2017 to air on MTV with rapper and actor Ludacris assuming the host role; the series would ultimately end in mid-2018 after two seasons on that network.\n\nHistory [ edit ]\n\nAs NBC\'s answer to the CBS television series Survivor, the show was initially a hit for the network in the summer of 2001 and built strong ratings and popularity in the following seasons. Joe Rogan, then known for his role on the sitcom NewsRadio (1995-1999) and as a commentator for Ultimate Fighting Championship was hired as the host. According to a 2015 interview with Art Bell, Rogan expected Fear Factor to be cancelled after a few episodes due to objections to some of the content and further stated that he took the job mainly to obtain observations and anecdotes for his stand-up comedy career.[2]\n\nThe series had a runaway success during the first few seasons, but after the series\' fourth season, the popularity and ratings for Fear Factor began to decline. By 2006, when Fear Factor was in its sixth season, the ratings for the series were in steep decline as a result of content concerns and a growing loss of viewer interest, coupled with the series facing tough competition with other TV shows in the same time slot. As a result, the series was only averaging a 2.6 in the ratings.[3][4] Later that year, Fear Factor faced tough competition with the TV ratings champion, Fox\'s talent series American Idol on Tuesday nights, and the ratings declined further, and continued to trend further downward during this period. Despite much publicity concerning an improved format and better stunts for Season Six, the series\' ratings continued to drop and consequently, NBC put the struggling program on hiatus for the remainder of the season to make room for the sitcom Joey, which was removed from the NBC lineup a few weeks later. After a continuous and steep drop in the series\' ratings, it was officially cancelled by NBC in May 2006 after six seasons and the network began airing the remainder of the season on June 13, 2006, with the remaining episodes to be aired throughout the summer, with its last episode airing on September 12, 2006. In 2004, Fear Factor became the first network reality show to be syndicated. Over its six seasons, Fear Factor earned NBC a reported $600 million in advertising revenue. Currently only the first season has been released on DVD, but in early 2009, plans were made to release a box set containing the entire series on DVD. The project was put on hold for an unknown reason in March 2010. On June 5, 2010, it was announced that the project was cancelled because of the low sales of the first season DVD.\n\nWith Chiller airing reruns of the show every Sunday night, the ratings on Chiller led to Comcast informing Entertainment Weekly in a May 31, 2011 report that Fear Factor would be revived for a new season. Eight episodes were ordered, with two of them being two-hour episodes and Rogan returning to the hosting duties.[5][6] The revival was shot in high-definition, and owing to concerns over the then-ongoing NFL Lockout and the loss of NBC Sunday Night Football episodes, TV Guide reported in early July the show could be ready as early as September as lockout replacement programming.[7] (NBC eventually lost one episode, the season premiere Hall of Fame Game, because of the lockout that ended in late July.) The program began airing December 12, 2011,[8] with the final episode airing July 16, 2012. On May 13, 2012, NBC announced that Fear Factor was officially cancelled.[9]\n\nIn April 2017, MTV announced that it would be reviving Fear Factor a second time for a 12-episode season. The first season of MTV\'s Fear Factor premiered on May 30, 2017 and concluded on August 22, 2017. Just prior to the first-season finale, it was announced that MTV had renewed the series for a second season consisting of 20 episodes.[10] The second season, subtitled Season From Hell, began airing on February 25, 2018.[11] The MTV revival is hosted by Ludacris and continues to use the format of four teams competing for a $50,000 prize. The stunts draw inspiration from elements of pop culture, such as horror movies, urban legends, and viral videos.[12]\n\nIn addition to Chiller, reruns of Fear Factor have aired in syndication, on FX and MTV2. The series also has a YouTube channel, where previously unaired footage is shown.\n\nOriginal format (2001\xe2\x80\x9306) [ edit ]\n\nThe show begins with an introduction from the narrator, and this is one most commonly used:\n\nImagine a world where your greatest fears become reality. Welcome to Fear Factor. Each show, six contestants from around the country battle each other in three extreme stunts. These stunts are designed to challenge the contestants both physically and mentally. If the contestant is too afraid to complete a stunt, they\'re eliminated. If they fail a stunt, they\'re eliminated. But if they succeed, they will be one step closer to the grand prize, $50,000.\n\nBefore the contestants are introduced (and at the half-way point of a two-hour special), Rogan presents a verbal disclaimer. The wording has changed with certain versions, but this is one most commonly used:\n\nI\'m Joe Rogan, and this is Fear Factor. The stunts you\'re about to see were all designed and supervised by trained professionals. They are extremely dangerous and should not be attempted by anyone, anywhere, anytime.\n\nThe normal format involves three men and three women, or four teams of two people with a pre-existing relationship, who have to complete three professional stunts to win US$50,000. Rogan noted that the stunts not only test any contestants/teams physically, but mentally as well. Any contestant(s)/team(s) who were too scared to attempt a stunt, failed to complete a stunt, or underperformed a stunt were eliminated from the competition. If only one contestant/team successfully completed the first or the second stunt, they automatically win $25,000, and the other contestants eliminated in the stunt along with the winner of the stunt return for the next stunt to compete for the remaining $25,000. If no one successfully completed the first or the second stunt, then all of the contestants/teams eliminated in the stunt would return to the next stunt to compete for a reduced $25,000 (this rule did not apply for non-elimination stunts). The only exception to this was in season one, where if one person completed the stunt, then the completer won $10,000 and the $50,000 grand prize was not reduced - on no occasion did a stunt go uncompleted by all 6 contestants, so it was never revealed how this would have been handled (however Rogan did state \'as usual\' in an early episode of the second series, when nobody completed the second stunt, even though it was the first time it had happened - it could be inferred from this that the prize would indeed have been reduced by 50%). In the final episode of season one, however, it was implied by Rogan, during the second stunt, that involved eating various pig parts, that if only one person won the stunt (after only one person won the previous stunt), then that person would get the $50,000 prize without the need to complete the final stunt.\n\nOnly once in the history of Fear Factor did the $50,000 prize go unclaimed in an episode. This happened on a Best Friends edition on September 27, 2004, when none of the remaining teams were able to complete the final stunt. In the stunt, one member of each team had to drive a ramp car, while the other member had to drive a sports car. The one driving the sports car had to drive it onto the truck bed via the ramp car. If the sports car fell off of the truck bed at any time, the team was automatically eliminated. Had it been successfully completed, the team who did this the fastest would have won. However, the last remaining contestants walked away with two Mazda vehicles for winning a previous stunt (see Second stunt).\n\nAfter the acquisition of Universal Studios of Vivendi by NBC\'s parent company General Electric in 2004, contestants could win vacations in order to promote the theme park division of NBCUniversal at Universal Orlando, or win trips to Universal Studios in Hollywood.\n\nThe order of the stunts on a typical episode of Fear Factor is as follows:\n\nFirst stunt: The first stunt is designed to physically test each of the contestants or teams (for example, jumping from one building to the next or hanging from a helicopter and collecting flags on a ladder). Usually, the two men and the two women, or the three teams, that gave the best performance (such as the fastest time, farthest distance, or number of flags collected in under a certain time) will move on to the second stunt. The others are eliminated. In the sixth season, a sometimes used rule was that the best-performing team won the ability to eliminate the team of their choice, meaning that teams who failed to complete the stunt or had the worst performance could still advance to the next round if the winning team did not choose to eliminate them.\n\nSecond stunt: The second stunt is meant to mentally challenge the contestants or teams. The three most common types of stunts in the second round are eating stunts, animal stunts, and retrieval/transfer stunts. Eating stunts entail ingesting vile animal parts, live bugs, or a blended concoction of multiple items; animal stunts entail immersing one\'s head or entire body in animals considered to be disgusting or intimidating (such as rats, spiders, snakes, or worms); retrieval/transfer stunts entail retrieving items or gross objects (often by mouth) hidden in disgusting substances (for example, blood or lard) or live animals. Less often, the second stunt involves a pain endurance challenge or embarrassment tolerance challenge, such as outlasting competitors in a tear gas chamber, walking on broken glass with bare feet, getting a tattoo, having their head shaved, getting piercings, or ingesting habanero peppers. With the exception of retrieval/transfer stunts, contestants are usually not eliminated after this stunt unless they fail to complete it or vomit before finishing. In the case of teams, one team may be eliminated for having the worst performance. In later episodes, a common (but not always used) rule was that no one would be eliminated after the second stunt; instead, the contestant or team that performed the best would receive a prize, such as a vehicle or a prize package similar in value. More often than not, the contestant/team with the best performance had the privilege of choosing the order that the contestants/teams had to go in to perform the next stunt [for the following day].\n\nExtremely rarely during the show\'s original run, Rogan would participate in the second stunt, most often as a way of encouraging contestants to take part. However, during a stunt involving tear gas in the third season, the wind changed direction, and tear gas blew in the direction of Rogan, the camera crew, and the other contestants that were not taking part at that particular moment. On another occasion during the first series, though it was not aired, Rogan ate 3 sheep eyes exactly like the contestants had to, as it was the first \'gross\' stunt to be taped in the series\' run, and he did not feel it fair that the contestants should go at it alone, while he sat cheering them on.\n\nThird stunt: The third and final stunt is usually something from an extreme type of stunt seen in an action film. Like the first stunt, it usually involves heights, water, vehicles, or some combination of the three. In order to avoid ties, this stunt is always competitive. The player or team with the best performance this round wins the grand prize, usually $50,000, and has the privilege of being informed by Rogan that ""evidently, fear is not a factor for you"". Naturally, one the one occasion that the $50,000 prize went unwon, Rogan instead informed the contestants that ""evidently, fear is a factor for you"". However, Rogan would also do this when nobody completed one of the earlier stunts, even when the stunt in question was not an elimination round.\n\nSpecial formats [ edit ]\n\nFour-Stunt Show [ edit ]\n\nThis was typically a 90-minute episode featuring four stunts instead of three. The first such episode aired in Season 3 and was notable for a stunt involving body piercing. In Seasons 4 to 6, at least one of the four stunts was a non-elimination stunt in which contestants competed for a prize. The four-stunt format was sometimes used in conjunction with themed episodes, such as Family Fear Factor, Twins Fear Factor, and Thanksgiving Fear Factor. In Season 5, six contestants from other reality shows competed in a two-hour, four-stunt episode for $50,000.\n\nExtended competitions [ edit ]\n\nSome Fear Factor competitions consisted of five or more stunts and featured an increased grand prize. These competitions were always presented as multi-part episodes or single two-hour episodes. The first such competitions were the Tournaments of Champions in Seasons 2 and 3 (see below). Season 4 included a two-hour season premiere in which twelve contestants competed in six stunts for a grand prize of $1,000,000; and a two-part, six-stunt Las Vegas episode where the winner would have a chance to win up to $100,000 based on his or her performance in the final stunt (they would then have to bet half their winnings on a hand of blackjack). Season 6 featured two three-episode, six-stunt competitions (""Psycho Fear Factor"" and ""Reality Stars Fear Factor""). Season 7 included two five-stunt competitions in which five teams competed for a grand prize of $100,000; the first aired as a single two-hour episode, and the second aired in two parts.\n\nTournament of Champions: The second and third seasons concluded with a Tournament of Champions featuring the winners of each show in that season and a $100,000 grand prize. In Season two, the thirteen non-celebrity winners were divided into groups of eight men and five women. For the first four stunts, men competed amongst men and women competed amongst women, in two stunts each. The men had to release a flag from a locked box while hanging suspended in the air and eat three different items from a table. The women had to collect flags while on top of an aircraft and retrieve three poles from a tank with alligators. The stunts narrowed the contestants down from eight men and five women to two men and two women who will, in the end, compete against each other for the grand prize by using a key to activate a horn while riding on a speeding truck. In Season three, the twenty-four winners were divided into two groups of twelve, each containing seven men and five women. In the first semifinal episode, the group was cut from twelve to six to three to two finalists. In the second semifinal episode, the group was cut from twelve to six in the first stunt, then the men competed amongst the men and the women competed amongst the women in the second stunt, and then the final four contestants, two men and two women, were cut to two finalists. Each finalist won a 2004 Mazda RX-8 and a chance at the $100,000. In the finals, the four finalists competed in three stunts. Each stunt eliminated one contestant, and the final stunt determined the winner.\n\nCouples Fear Factor: Seasons 4 and 5 both included Couples Fear Factor competitions that played out over seven episodes and featured a grand prize of $1,000,000. Nine couples competed in 17 stunts in Season 4, and eight couples competed in 14 stunts in Season 5. In Season 4, each episode contained two or three stunts, with at least one stunt being a non-elimination stunt. In Season 5, each episode featured two stunts; the first was always a non-elimination stunt, and the second usually eliminated the team with the worst performance. In contrast to the regular format, only one team was eliminated in each elimination stunt; if multiple teams failed the stunt, then the teams that succeeded would vote on which failing team to eliminate. Almost every stunt offered a prize (e.g., cars, vacations, pre-loaded credit cards, a chance to steal a desired prize from another team) or a $10,000 incentive to the team with the best performance. Couples Fear Factor episodes had certain stylistic differences from the regular format, including a different opening sequence, and onscreen interviews with the contestants (regular episodes usually presented interviews in voiceover format only).\n\nPsycho Fear Factor: A three-episode series in which six couples competed in six stunts for various cash and prizes, including a grand prize of $250,000. The stunts were centered around the Bates Motel on the set of the original Psycho horror movie from Paramount Pictures. Unlike other Fear Factor episodes, contestants were required to sleep in the filthy Bates Motel between stunts and were subjected to Fear Factor pranks and mini-challenges while in the motel.\n\nReality Stars Fear Factor: A three-episode series in which five teams of Reality TV stars competed in six stunts for various cash and prizes, including a grand prize of $150,000. The series featured teams from The Amazing Race, Survivor, American Idol, The Apprentice, and The Real World.\n\nOther formats [ edit ]\n\nCelebrity special (Seasons two, three, and six): In Seasons 2 and 3, episodes with celebrity contestants were played in the normal format, except that contestants were playing for charity. The winning contestant\'s charity would receive $50,000, and other contestants\' charities would receive a lesser amount ($10,000 or $25,000). In Season 6, eight celebrity contestants paired up into teams of two for the first two stunts but competed individually in the final stunt. Stephen Baldwin, Kevin Richardson and Alan Thicke are among the celebrities who have competed on Fear Factor.[13] Season 2 included an episode featuring six WWF/E stars; it was won by Matt Hardy.\n\nAll-Gross Show (Seasons three to six): All three stunts on this show followed the format of the second (gross) stunt as described above. The first such episode involved bobbing for objects in a vat containing 50 gallons of cow blood. In seasons four and five, the all-gross format was used for Halloween-themed episodes. In season six, a ""Farm Fear Factor"" episode featured all gross stunts.\n\nMixed Team and Individual Stunts (Seasons two, five, and six): In most episodes, contestants competed individually or in teams of two for the entire competition. However, there were three episodes in which contestants paired up into teams for the first and/or second stunt but competed individually in the final stunt. The first instance of this was a Season 2 episode in which three pairs of twins competed as teams in the first stunt, and competed individually the second and third stunts. In Season 5\'s ""New York vs. L.A."" episode, the first stunt narrowed a pool of eight contestants down to four (one man and one woman from each city); contestants from the same city then teamed up in the second stunt, and all contestants competed as individuals in the final stunt. A Season 6 celebrity episode had contestants competing as teams in the first two stunts and individually in the final stunt. In the latter episode, contestants were allowed to attempt the stunts alone if their partner quit before the stunt started.\n\nHoliday specials (Seasons three to five): Over the course of the series, Fear Factor produced three Christmas episodes, two Halloween episodes, and a Thanksgiving episode. The Christmas episodes featured Christmas-themed stunts but were otherwise played in the normal format. The Halloween episodes followed the all-gross format, and the Thanksgiving episode followed the four-stunt format.\n\nLas Vegas Show (Seasons three to five): Stunts took place at various hotels and casinos in Las Vegas. The show\'s winner was required to bet at least half of their winnings on one hand of Blackjack, with the chance to continue gambling if successful.\n\nSpecial Contestants (Seasons two to seven): Some episodes featured a specific type of contestant (e.g., models, all-female, twins, military members, reality TV stars, freaks and geeks, young and old, returning contestants) or teams with a specific type of relationship (e.g., couples, newlyweds, siblings, best friends, parent/child teams, exes). Many of these episodes were played in the regular format, although some used a four-stunt or extended competition format.\n\nFear Factor Super Bowl Halftime Show (Season two): Played in the normal format with Playboy Playmates. The first stunt aired as counter programming to the Super Bowl halftime show and ended right before the third quarter of the game started. The remaining two stunts were shown immediately after the game as counter programming to the Super Bowl lead-out show.\n\nMiss USA (Seasons three to five): Played in the normal format with Miss USA contestants, with the winning contestant keeping $25,000 and giving $25,000 to a charity of their choice. There was no Miss USA edition in the sixth season of Fear Factor, as NBC produced a Miss USA edition of Deal or No Deal instead; the Miss USA contestants were the briefcase models for the entire episode. The next time that Miss USA delegates would be involved in a game show was in 2010 on Minute to Win It. The Miss USA edition was not present in the show\'s final two seasons, as the current format had four teams of two people.\n\nBlind Date (Season six): Four single men were introduced to four single women, and either the women (in the first episode) or the men (in the second episode) got to choose their partner among the available contestants of the opposite sex. The game was then played in the regular format, with the winning team dividing the prize.\n\nSleep Deprivation (Season four): Five co-ed pairs of contestants competed as teams in the normal format, with one exception: contestants had to stay awake for the 48-hour duration of the competition. If a contestant fell asleep at any time before the final stunt was completed, his or her team would be eliminated. This was the only episode in the TV series in which contestants could be eliminated in the downtime between stunts.[citation needed]\n\nMillion Dollar Heist: (Season six): Played in the regular teams format, but instead of competing for the normal $50,000 prize, teams would race head-to-head to ""steal"" up to $1,000,000 worth of gold from an armored truck submerged in water for their final stunt. The team that ""stole"" the most money\'s worth of gold within the time limit would win the combined amount of money collected by both teams.\n\nHome Invasion: This short segment was included at the end of each episode in Season six. It involved Joe Rogan going to different homes across America and challenging a family to compete in a stunt. Each stunt usually involved the contestants, under time limit (usually one minute), ingesting or bobbing in something foul or undesirable. If successful, the family would win up to $5,000 in the form of pre-loaded credit cards from Capital One.\n\nRevived series (2011\xe2\x80\x9312) [ edit ]\n\nThe series revival began airing on December 12, 2011, and the two premiere episodes were viewed by 8.7 million and 8.5 million viewers, respectively.[14] This makes the premiere the highest non-sports programming to air on NBC at 8:00 p.m. since February 2008. Following Rogan\'s word for a verbal disclaimer, the narrator gives a statement, and this is one most commonly used:\n\nIt all began ten years ago, at the dawn of reality television. Audiences had never seen anything like it. Now, the legend begins all over again. It\'s bigger, better and more intense than ever before. Welcome back to Fear Factor.\n\nThe revival featured four teams of two people with a preexisting relationship per episode, rather than the original versions\' six people (three males and three females). The first five seasons had typically used the three male, three female grouping, but the sixth and final pre-revival season always utilized 4 teams of two people each. The stunts have remained basically the same, with the ""gross"" one in between the two physical ones.\n\nNBC pulled a two-hour, five team, five stunt episode entitled ""Leeches & Shaved Heads & Tear Gas, Oh My!"" which featured a stunt where teams spun a wheel to determine whether they would have to shave their heads and eyebrows, get tattooed, or be tear gassed. This episode was scheduled to air in two parts on January 23 and 30, 2012, but it was postponed after Part 1 was replaced by a GOP debate.\n\nAnother episode, entitled ""Hee Haw! Hee Haw!"" and featuring a stunt where contestants drink the urine and semen of a donkey, was then scheduled to air January 30, 2012. Hesitant about airing the stunt, NBC eventually pulled the episode after pictures of the stunt appeared online. Video footage of the stunt appeared online after the episode aired on Danish TV in June 2012,[15] and Fear Factor eventually posted short clips of all three stunts on their YouTube channel in July 2014.[16][17][18]\n\nThe sixth episode, entitled ""The Bees Are So Angry"", was two hours instead of the usual one, and included five teams, five stunts, and a $100,000 prize instead of the usual four teams, three stunts, and $50,000 prize. Following this episode, The Voice replaced the series\' slot on Monday nights.\n\nNBC rescheduled the two hour ""Leeches & Shaved Heads & Tear Gas, Oh My!"" episode, which aired in two parts over the nights of July 9 and July 16. The first part ended with the ""To Be Continued"" subtitle followed by a preview for the second part. As of July 2012, Fear Factor was officially cancelled.\n\nSyndication [ edit ]\n\nFear Factor entered an off-network syndication in 2004 and the fall of that year NBCUniversal Television Distribution put it into barter syndication and aired on affiliates of Fox The WB and UPN affiliates and aired on cable channel FX and aired for two years however as of fall 2006 Fear Factor has left local syndication due to lack of sales of NBCUniversal and was not renewed for other season next fall since NBC canceled Fear Factor after 5 seasons due to low ratings\n\nUS Nielsen ratings [ edit ]\n\nOrder Episode Airdate Rating Share Rating/Share\n\n(18\xe2\x80\x9349) Viewers\n\n(millions) Rank\n\n(Timeslot) Rank\n\n(Night) 1 ""Scorpion Tales"" December 12, 2011 5.0[19] 8 3.3/9[20] 8.78 #2 #5 2 ""Broken Hearts and Blood Baths"" December 12, 2011 4.6 7 3.5/8 8.52 #2 #4 3 ""Tall Crappaccino"" December 19, 2011 3.5[21] 5 2.5/6[22] 6.37 #1 #5 4 ""Snake Bite"" January 2, 2012 3.2[23] 5 2.4/5[24] 6.01 #2 #7 5 ""Roach Coach"" January 9, 2012 3.1[25] 5 2.3/5[26] 5.53 #2 #5 6 ""The Bees Are So Angry"" February 12, 2012 2.3[27] 4 1.5/3[28] 3.73 #3 #11 7 ""Leeches & Shaved Heads & Tear Gas, Oh My!

Unaired in the U.S. due to content concerns.\n\nMTV format (2017\xe2\x80\x932018) [ edit ]\n\nMTV\'s Fear Factor revival continued to use the format of four teams of two people competing in three challenges for a $50,000 grand prize, as in Seasons 6 and 7 of the NBC series. As the show started, Ludacris gives a verbal disclaimer. The wording has changed with certain versions, but this is one commonly used:\n\nThe challenges you are about to see were designed and tested by trained professionals. They are extremely ludicrous and should never be attempted by anyone, anywhere, or at anytime. This is MTV\'s Fear Factor.\n\nHowever, the order of the stunts, as well as some of the rules, differ from the original format. Each episode of the MTV version has three named rounds: Beat the Beast, Face Your Fear, and The Final Fear.\n\nBeat the Beast: This stunt challenges the contestants to conquer their fear of something creepy (usually live creatures considered gross or intimidating) and generally follows the same format as animal stunts from the second stunt of the original version. The team with the best performance in this round wins a ""FearVantage"", which is an advantage in the next round (such as picking the order).\n\nFace Your Fear: This is a challenge tailored to a common fear shared by all of the contestants on a particular episode. The nature of this stunt varies widely depending on the fears of the contestants.\n\nThe Final Fear: This is an extreme physical stunt that follows the same format as the first and third stunts from the original version of the show. The team with the best performance wins the $50,000 grand prize.\n\nControversy [ edit ]\n\nFear Factor has received criticism from the general public mainly because of the show\'s second stunt, which intends to disgust its viewers. The American Humane Association expressed concerns for allowing various animals to get injured, and even killing insects by eating them alive during the videotaping of the show. The association also revealed that professional animal trainers have refused to work on the show because the producers of Fear Factor have demanded stunts which violate the association\'s guidelines.\n\nAmerican Humane believes that shows like Fear Factor are on a slippery slope of animal mistreatment and provide poor examples of animal treatment and humane ethics. As we work diligently to expand voluntary compliance with animal safety guidelines, organisations like Endemol who blatantly demonstrate complete disregard for animal welfare, or even that of their human contestants \xe2\x80\x94 are producing unacceptable programming. Karen Rosa (Communications Manager of AHA Film and TV Unit)[33]\n\nIn January 2005, an episode featuring a stunt involving blended rats aired in its normal prime time slot. Austin Aitken, a part-time paralegal from Cleveland, Ohio, sued NBC for $2.5 million USD for airing the show, claiming that he felt so disgusted from watching the stunt, his blood pressure rose until he felt dizzy and lightheaded and subsequently vomited. He claimed that his disorientation was so severe that he ran into a doorway and seriously injured himself. In March 2005, U.S. District Judge Lesley Wells threw out the lawsuit on the grounds of First Amendment protection.[34]\n\nFear Factor was also criticized by major U.S. electrical utilities for an episode that required contestants to climb through a simulated electrical substation with ""electrified wires"" replete with simulated sparks and electrical sounds added in post-processing. The Edison Electric Institute issued a warning regarding the episode, fearing that viewers might attempt to climb through a real substation with potentially fatal results.[35]\n\nAn episode originally scheduled for January 30, 2012, featuring contestants drinking donkey semen and urine, was rejected by NBC, which instead aired a rerun.[36] On January 31, 2012, two of the contestants, twin sisters Claire and Brynne Odioso, appeared on The Cowhead Show on Tampa Bay radio station WHPT to talk about their experiences in that episode; however, according to TMZ.com, producers of Fear Factor warned the Odioso sisters not to continue any discussion of the program, as doing so would put them in breach of their confidentiality agreements.[37]\n\nSpin-off products [ edit ]\n\nFear Factor has also resulted in various spin-off products:'"
"b'The deal includes an apology and money for the First Lady.\n\nFirst Lady Melania Trump has settled her defamation lawsuit against Mail Media over a Daily Mail story that suggested she was an escort when she emigrated to the United States in the 1990s.\n\nThe parties announced the resolution in a joint press release that shares word that Mail Media is making an apology as well as paying her an unspecified amount of money to end the lawsuit.\n\nMs. Trump sued in September 2016, during the heat of the campaign and with immigration as one of the election\'s biggest issues. She first filed her case in Maryland and took issue with an Aug. 19 article titled, ""Naked photoshoots, and troubling questions about visas that won\'t go away: The VERY racy past of Donald Trump\'s Slovenian wife.""\n\nRepresented by Charles Harder, the same attorney who represented Hulk Hogan\'s privacy suit against Gawker Media, the lawsuit targeted a story that discussed ""highly-charged, lesbian-themed, nude photographs"" and also questioned the exact timing of when she traveled to the U.S. on a visa. Much of the article relied on the work of a Slovenian journalist who had co-authored an unauthorized biography of Ms. Trump. There was some reliance on a Slovenian magazine to make the claim that the modeling agency she worked at was run by a New York entrepreneur, who allegedly also operated an escort agency for wealthy clients. The story also suggested that she and Donald Trump met three years earlier than they acknowledged and ""staged"" their actual meeting as a ""ruse.""\n\nMs. Trump also sued a Maryland blogger named Webster Griffin Tarpley, who made similar claims on his website.\n\nThe litigation triggered an interesting showdown over jurisdiction with a Maryland judge ultimately agreeing this case wasn\'t for her courtroom.\n\nThe case was then refiled, without Tarpley, in New York, and the case made more news with new pleadings that talked about lost business opportunities for Ms. Trump at a time when her husband was attempting to very lightly distance himself from a business empire for ethical reasons.\n\nBut the case won\'t last long.\n\nThe Daily Mail has now agreed to a retraction.\n\n""We accept that these allegations about Mrs Trump are not true and we retract and withdraw them,"" the publication\'s parent company said in the statement. ""We apologise to Mrs Trump for any distress that our publication caused her. To settle Mrs Trump\xe2\x80\x99s two lawsuits against us, we have agreed to pay her damages and costs.""'"

"b""The closing credits to the new documentary I Am Heath Ledger are accompanied by a recording of its subject, being asked by an interviewer what he would make of a movie about his life. \xe2\x80\x9cI think it would be a pretty boring movie,\xe2\x80\x9d he responds with a laugh. Nine years after the actor\xe2\x80\x99s untimely death at 28 from an accidental, lethal combination of prescription medications, such a movie has arrived, and it is hardly boring.\n\nDirected by Derik Murray and Adrian Buitenhuis, the film paints a portrait of the Australian actor through footage he took himself \xe2\x80\x94 he seemed always to have a camera in hand \xe2\x80\x94 and interviews with his family, friends and colleagues. Among the talking heads are childhood friends, his ex-girlfriend Naomi Watts, his longtime agent and friend Steve Alexander and directors including Ang Lee (Brokeback Mountain) and Catherine Hardwicke (Lords of Dogtown).\n\nThe documentary, which airs tonight on Spike at 10 p.m. EST and will be available on iTunes and Amazon on May 23, aims to reveal the person behind not only the roles but also the ravenous tabloid coverage that followed his death. Through the memories of those closest to him, Ledger is resurrected as a devoted father, an actor whose constant striving was often fueled by self-doubt, a lover of music, chess and Burning Man, and a talent whose future seemed boundless.\n\nHere are some of the lesser-known elements of Ledger\xe2\x80\x99s story which the film brings into focus:\n\nHe was certain he had flubbed a major screen test with his idol, Mel Gibson.\n\nLedger grew up idolizing the Mad Max actor, who was once the biggest Australian movie star. When he went to do a screen test for the 2000 Gibson starrer The Patriot, he flubbed his lines, then stopped the audition and apologized to Gibson and director Roland Emmerich for wasting their time. But Gibson and Emmerich saw something in the young actor and took a chance on him, giving him his first big role since breaking out in 10 Things I Hate About You.\n\nMORE: Jake Gyllenhaal on How Heath Ledger\xe2\x80\x99s Death Affected Him\n\nIt was during the promotion of A Knight\xe2\x80\x99s Tale that Ledger began to really struggle with fame.\n\nLedger\xe2\x80\x99s next move after The Patriot was the medieval adventure film A Knight\xe2\x80\x99s Tale. His ruggedly handsome face and tousled hair \xe2\x80\x94 accompanied by the promise, \xe2\x80\x9cHe will rock you\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 was plastered all over Los Angeles, and he was set to tour the U.S. as the film\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9csecret weapon.\xe2\x80\x9d But the role of salesman didn\xe2\x80\x99t sit well with the actor. As his friend, the director Matt Amato, puts it in the documentary, \xe2\x80\x9cHe wanted fame. And then when he got it, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t want it. He was mortified, and he felt owned.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHeath Ledger in 2006. Sarah Rhodes\xe2\x80\x94Getty Images\n\nAng Lee cast Heath Ledger in Brokeback Mountain because of his performance in Monster\xe2\x80\x99s Ball.\n\nLee says that initially he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure if Ledger could carry the film. He ended up hiring him based on his work in Monster\xe2\x80\x99s Ball, in which he plays a corrections officer opposite Billy Bob Thornton. Lee adds that Ledger is the only actor he has ever allowed to look at the monitor after takes. Rather than making him overly self-aware, as Lee feared such self-observation might, Ledger used the process to reflect on his performance and turn out even better takes.\n\nLedger\xe2\x80\x99s romantic interest in his Brokeback costar Michelle Williams became clear after she got injured on set.\n\nWhile filming a scene in which Ennis (Ledger) and Alma (Williams) go sledding, the toboggan flipped and Williams needed to be taken to the hospital. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen we reached the hospital we saw Heath holding her hand trying to comfort her,\xe2\x80\x9d Lee recalls in the film. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was pretty obvious he was interested in her.\xe2\x80\x9d Their daughter Matilda was born the following year, and they remained together until 2007.\n\nHe once surprised his friend, the musician Ben Harper, with a grand piano, asking for a lullaby in return.\n\nAfter a night playing music with Ledger on the actor\xe2\x80\x99s grand piano, Harper went home to get some rest. He awoke to hear a commotion outside: the piano had arrived on his doorstep, a gift from Ledger. When Harper protested his friend\xe2\x80\x99s generosity, Ledger told him, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s supposed to be with you.\xe2\x80\x9d A few weeks later, Ledger, who was expecting a child with Williams, asked Harper to write a lullaby they could play for their daughter when she was born. \xe2\x80\x9cNothing has ever been asked of me that\xe2\x80\x99s that precious,\xe2\x80\x9d Harper says in the documentary.\n\nOne of his trademarks as the Joker was the result of challenges in the makeup room.\n\nLedger did much of his own makeup for his role as the Joker in Christopher Nolan\xe2\x80\x99s The Dark Knight, a part for which he would go on to win a posthumous Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. He wore a prosthetic on his mouth to create the illusion of the villain\xe2\x80\x99s famous scarring, but it frequently became detached when he spoke. Rather than repeatedly returning to the makeup room to have it re-glued, explains his dialogue coach Gerry Grennell, Ledger began licking his lips to keep it in place. As he repeated the motion, he began to incorporate it into the character.\n\nAn avid chess player and aspiring director, he was planning to direct a movie about the game.\n\nLedger loved chess from a young age, and he was good at it: his father Kim says that by the time his son was 10 or 11, he was difficult to beat, and he was only a few points away from achieving Grand Master status when he died. He was also an aspiring director, having directed music videos for Harper and the hip hop artist N\xe2\x80\x99fa, a childhood friend. He planned to combine those loves by directing an adaptation of The Queen\xe2\x80\x99s Gambit, a novel about a chess player who is addicted to pills, but Ledger died before production began.\n\nGet The Brief.

She then attended boarding school at the Lawrenceville School in New Jersey, where she met her first husband, Topper Mortimer. Together, they moved to New York City, where Tinsley attended Columbia University and graduated with a degree in art history. As soon as Tinsley landed in New York, her blonde hair, Southern belle charm, and personal branding abilities propelled her into high society. She quickly became synonymous with the New York social scene and was the most photographed woman in New York City in the early 2000s.

Tinsley then became the beauty ambassador for the iconic French fashion design house of Christian Dior and helped to create a lip gloss coined Tinsley Pink.\n\nTinsley went on to publish her first novel,Southern Charm, and made her television debut in the hit TV show Gossip Girl in 2010. When she and Topper divorced, she decided to take a sabbatical from the fast-paced and overwhelming lifestyle that she created for herself in New York City. A respite in Palm Beach gave her time to reflect on her accomplishments, and in late 2016, Tinsley decided to move back to New York City and prove that there is more to her than meets the eye.\n\nOnce back in the city she loves, she channeled her energy into her charity efforts, including supporting the Best Friends Animal Society.

"b'By now, Feud audiences are well acquainted with two of the most notorious chapters in Bette Davis and Joan Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s shared Hollywood history\xe2\x80\x94their rivalry during the making of What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?, and the ugly Oscars aftermath\xe2\x80\x94in which Crawford found a way to hijack what Davis thought should have been her best-actress statuette. But a lesser-known Davis-Crawford battle followed\xe2\x80\x94on the set of another Bob Aldrich\xe2\x80\x93directed psycho-thriller, *Hush. . . Hush, Sweet Charlotte.\xe2\x80\x9d And on Sunday night\xe2\x80\x99s episode of Feud, \xe2\x80\x9cAbandoned,\xe2\x80\x9d Ryan Murphy revealed how Davis masterminded her own sadistic revenge on her once-again co-star.\n\nUnderstandably, the actresses were reluctant to re-team given their history. Before signing onto the film, Crawford demanded her name be billed first; to get Davis on board, Aldrich made a series of sizable concessions including a $200,000 paycheck\xe2\x80\x94the same fee Aldrich was receiving\xe2\x80\x94and his word that Davis would be an associate producer on the picture. However, during pre-production, Davis felt Aldrich was ignoring her input and fired off a firmly worded eight-page letter threatening to quit.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou do not function well with someone of my type,\xe2\x80\x9d Davis wrote Aldrich, according to Shaun Considine\xe2\x80\x99s Bette and Joan: The Divine Feud\xe2\x80\x94an absolute must-read for fans of the FX series. \xe2\x80\x9cThat was obvious throughout the filming of Baby Jane\xe2\x80\x94and the suicidal desire this put me into many times, was almost more than I was able to bear. . . I do not wear well with tricks designed to make me do what someone else decides I will do.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShe ended by suggesting Aldrich \xe2\x80\x9cre-cast and pay me off. It will be cheaper in the long run.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThis maneuver explains how Davis found herself sitting at Aldrich\xe2\x80\x99s side throughout filming, why Aldrich obliged Davis\xe2\x80\x99s creative input, and how Davis secured the leverage to properly torture Crawford.\n\nAlthough certain moments in \xe2\x80\x9cAbandoned\xe2\x80\x9d feel exaggerated for dramatic effect\xe2\x80\x94like Crawford being made to wait for her hotel room, and then being stuck in a room next to the garbage disposal\xe2\x80\x94the episode\xe2\x80\x99s writers actually skimped on the insane details of what actually happened.\n\nFor example, according to Shaun Considine\xe2\x80\x99s Bette and Joan: The Divine Feud, Crawford arrived at the Baton Rouge airport with a full entourage\xe2\x80\x94including her hairdresser, makeup artist, and enough baggage to . . . well, let Davis explain:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor a goddamn week in Baton Rouge, she brought twenty pieces of luggage. It was a black-and-white movie but she had color-coordinated outfits for the daytime scenes, and for the night shots all of her evening dresses were chiffon, which meant that the wardrobe lady had to spend hours ironing them in the one-hundred-degree weather.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWhen Crawford arrived to set the fourth day of filming, Davis had already tactically befriended the local press and crew\xe2\x80\x94the latter of whom she would eat lunch with. George Cukor later reflected on Davis\xe2\x80\x99s stone-cold set strategy: \xe2\x80\x9cShe wanted to make a basket case out of Joan, and she almost succeeded.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTo further chip away at Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s ego, Davis also coordinated group outings, cast and crew dinners, and other after-hours activities, inviting everyone except Joan. \xe2\x80\x9cDavis [also] made sure that everyone, including members of the press and distinguished visitors to the set, knew that Joan was really 60 years old,\xe2\x80\x9d authors Lawrence J. Quirk and William Schoell write in Joan Crawford: The Essential Biography, before revealing another Davis tactic. \xe2\x80\x9cShe would also stand next to director Aldrich while he was filming Joan\xe2\x80\x99s scenes and make loud, negative comments.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWhen Crawford woke up from a nap on set one day to discover that the entire production had left the location without her, \xe2\x80\x9cJoan was convinced that Davis was behind it, and furthermore that Davis was manipulating Aldrich behind the scenes,\xe2\x80\x9d wrote Quirk and Schoell. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98She\xe2\x80\x99s practically directing the picture for him right in front of me,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d she complained. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98So God knows what else she\xe2\x80\x99s up to behind my back. I might wind up on the cutting-room floor.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d'"

"b'Fuller House actress Jodie Sweetin has obtained a restraining order against her ex, Justin Hodak. Sweetin, 35, and Hodak, 40, just broke up after a year long engagement and Sweetin went on to get a restraining order. The court order required Hodak to stay 100 yards away from her, her job, her home, her children\xe2\x80\x99s school and her vehicle. It also prohibited Hodak from contacting Sweetin in any way whether directly or indirectly.\n\nHodak arrested\n\nThe ex-fianc\xc3\xa9 clearly could not adhere to the restraining order and was arrested at Sweetin\xe2\x80\x99s Sherman Oaks home in Carlifonia on Monday. It was merely days after the actress got the restraining order when Hodak showed up at her home. Sweetin called the police when she saw a suspicious vehicle outside her home and the cops swung in and arrested Hodak from his car. It was the second time he was arrested in a week as he was previously caught for unlawful possession of a firearm, as a convicted felon Hodak is not allowed to possess a rifle.\n\nRaging arguments fractured their relationship\n\nThe two had a heated fight earlier on in the month that prompted Sweetin to call off the engagement. The fight, that estranged the two lovers, was escalated by Hodak\xe2\x80\x99s rage. He was using testosterone supplements and steroids that were saidb to have fuelled his anger. The court documents had some revealing information stating that Hodak was abusing alcohol and marijuana on the said day. In the documents, Hodak supposedly threatened to commit suicide if Sweetin made him leave. Hodak left the house a while later armed with a 9mm pistol.\n\nThe court documents also state that Hodak had confessed to Sweetin about a drug problem and incarceration due to felony offences such as assault with a deadly weapon so as to support the habit. Hodak kept pestering the actress and made 87 phone calls just between the time of the break up and obtaining of the Emergency Protective Order. In addition to this, he also threatened to sell compromising photos of Sweetin which he keeps on his phone.\n\nA narrative of abuse\n\nIn the documents, Jodie Sweetin also admits to abuse on various other altercations. The two lovers often had arguments where Hodak would throw things at Sweetin. At one time, during a previous break-up, Hodak followed Sweetin to Burbank at the Warner Bros. studios demanding to talk to her where he got into a push and shove with the security guards. In another incidence, Hodak waited for the actress outside her children\xe2\x80\x99s school for a confrontation.\n\nJodie Sweetin stated, through her spokesperson, that she would appreciate privacy at this time. The scary situation has not been fully settled, however, Sweetin\xe2\x80\x99s restraining order offers protection to people close to her including; her parents, daughters and assistant.'"

"b""It\xe2\x80\x99s been well over a year since Kim Kardashian was robbed at gunpoint in her Paris hotel room. The violent attack, which happened on Oct. 3, 2016, took an emotional and psychological toll on Kardashian and her family. Even her husband Kanye West is still grappling with the after-effects of the incident. While he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t with his wife at the moment the robbery happened, Kanye West\xe2\x80\x99s reaction to Kim Kardashian\xe2\x80\x99s Paris robbery is quite sad and really speaks to the depth of his love for her.\n\nIn an all-new interview with radio personality Charlamagne tha God, West spoke at length about a variety of topics, including his mental health, therapy, Twitter, and Kardashian\xe2\x80\x99s robbery.\n\nIn the interview, West talked about feeling hopeless in light of his wife\xe2\x80\x99s Paris misfortune:\n\nYou're feeling, like, helpless, like what can you do? \xe2\x80\xa6 I went to Paris on that trip to protect her. Not protect her physically, but to just go and help her with her looks because she's in Paris. So I'm like, 'Let me put my eye on it personally.'\n\nThe famed rapper left to be at his wife\xe2\x80\x99s side in the middle of a set during the Meadows Music and Arts Festival in New York. He cited a \xe2\x80\x9cfamily emergency\xe2\x80\x9d at the time and promptly took his leave.\n\nDimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images\n\nDuring his interview with Charlamagne tha God, West also talked about how Kardashian\xe2\x80\x99s assailants plotted against her and waited for him to be out the picture:\n\nOne of the things she said that she heard was they were coming to rob her and they had to wait until I had left. The people had been strategizing and scheming on that for a long time. So when she probably got to Paris by herself, they were like 'This is our chance.' The next thing you know, I get off the flight the next day, and they were like, 'Oh, OK, we gotta like fall back.' And then when I left a couple days later \xe2\x80\x94 I almost stayed \xe2\x80\x94 I hear, my friend comes up to me and says 'Your wife was robbed.'\n\nIt sounds as if West feels a bit of regret about not staying by Kardashian\xe2\x80\x99s side during that trip, which is super sad. Ultimately, the whole ordeal isn\xe2\x80\x99t West\xe2\x80\x99s fault, but that he still feels the sting of it really shows how much the incident impacted him.\n\nKardashian herself has been exceptionally outspoken about the incident, often relaying the details of the robbery for talk shows, interviews, and social media. In an Instagram post from March 2017, Kardashian shared a few words ahead of an episode of Keeping Up With the Kardashians that revolved around the robbery:\n\nTonight's episode is going to be very tough for me. However, I thought it was important to share this story through my eyes & not in an interview where my own words could be twisted. I have always shared so much & I'm not going to hold back when this was probably one of the most life changing experiences for me. I would never wish this experience upon anyone, but have learned some valuable lessons & feel so blessed to be safe home with my babies & husband. To my friends, family, and loved ones I can't thank you enough for being there when I needed you the most. To the French police, thank you for your incredible hard work.\n\nAlthough the violent robbery had a profound effect on West and Kardashian, it seems that they\xe2\x80\x99ve really pulled through and are stronger than ever. Kardashian has frequently said that she\xe2\x80\x99s a better person because of what happened. And there\xe2\x80\x99s absolutely no doubt that her relationship with West and her children is strengthened because of that.\n\nThe road to healing after such a traumatic event is long, but Kardashian and West are well on their way."""

What do I have to offer? What do I have to learn?\xe2\x80\x99 I started learning about the brain, psychology.

I never looked back. I never wished to be acting again. I was so engaged.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n(In a previous interview with Yahoo, Hawn also suggested that she had no interest in waiting around for Hollywood offers either: \xe2\x80\x9cEvery woman hits a certain age; every woman has to face it. That\xe2\x80\x99s the way it goes, and I really am not a sit-around-and-wait-for-the-phone-to-ring person.\xe2\x80\x9d)\n\nIn 2016, Schumer confessed that it took her several years to convince Hawn to take a role in the mother-daughter comedy she had written.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI met her on an airplane a couple of years ago and told her there\xe2\x80\x99s a movie I really want to make with her,\xe2\x80\x9d Schumer told the Los Angeles Times. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd she was very nice. \xe2\x80\x98O.K., honey.\xe2\x80\x99 She probably thought I was a psycho. . . . Then I\xe2\x80\x99d meet her at different things, saying, \xe2\x80\x98We\xe2\x80\x99re making this movie together,\xe2\x80\x99 and I think, eventually, some people got in her ear and told her I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t crazy, that I make things.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIn her conversation with Hudson, Hawn also reflected on how the industry changed while she was still acting in film, and the one movie star who is not having any of this television business.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe business was changing while I was in it,\xe2\x80\x9d Hawn reflected. \xe2\x80\x9cConglomerates were coming in, starting to buy studios.

"b'Jimmy Kimmel wants to stop celebrity promposals: \'It\'s creepy\'\n\nKelly Lawler | USA TODAY\n\nJimmy Kimmel doesn\'t mind taking time out of his show to lecture a few teenagers.\n\nThe late night host spent a portion of his Wednesday night monologue ranting about the latest trend coming out of high schools: ""celebrity promposals.""\n\nOne Arizona teen\'s campaign went viral thanks to his elaborate La La Land-themed promposal to Emma Stone, and Kylie Jenner actually attended a prom in Sacramento the other week.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a cute story \xe2\x80\xa6 I know, I get it, but it\xe2\x80\x99s also terrible and it has to be stopped,\xe2\x80\x9d Kimmel said. \xe2\x80\x9cListen, kid: Emma Stone, whether she is in London or not, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to go to the prom with you. At all. It\xe2\x80\x99s probably the last thing that she wants to do, and not because she\xe2\x80\x99s in London working. She doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to go to a dance with you because she\xe2\x80\x99s 28, and 28-year-old people don\xe2\x80\x99t want to go on dates with 16-year-old children because it\xe2\x80\x99s creepy.""\n\nKimmel also addressed the awkwardness and gender roles involved, noting that Stone had been backed into a corner where she was was forced to respond or she would ""look like a jerk.""\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do we find it socially acceptable for a boy to ask an adult celebrity on a date?\xe2\x80\x9d Kimmel asked. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat if it was the other way around? What if Shailene Woodley \xe2\x80\x94 no, you know what? What if Shia LaBeouf showed up at a high school looking for a date? He\xe2\x80\x99d be arrested, right? He\xe2\x80\x99d be beaten and arrested. But when this kid asks Emma Stone, oh it\xe2\x80\x99s adorable (and) we put him on (Good Morning America). In fact, this is a hostage situation, because if Emma Stone didn\xe2\x80\x99t write him a letter, she would look like a jerk.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe moral of the story?\n\n""Kids, don\'t look for your prom date in Us Weekly,"" he said.

Well, Vogue\xe2\x80\x98s May issue is just the thing you need to hold you over until May 1. This year\xe2\x80\x99s co-chair, Katy Perry, graces the cover wearing Comme des Gar\xc3\xa7ons\xe2\x80\x99 architectural, artistic and yes, sometimes wacky runway looks throughout the entire spread.\n\nImage zoom Credit: Mert Alas and Marcus Piggott/Vogue\n\nStyled by the legendary Grace Coddington, Perry models pieces from Comme des Gar\xc3\xa7ons\xe2\x80\x99 runway collections spanning from 2005 to 2017 each more eye-catching than the next. (Which has us imagining what she\xe2\x80\x99ll wear for her big moment on May 1 \xe2\x80\x93 and wondering how she\xe2\x80\x99ll possibly get up the grand staircase in these restricting designs.)\n\nGet push notifications with news, features and more.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me know when Zoolander 3 starts shooting,\xe2\x80\x9d Perry joked on the set of the shoot, but added seriously: \xe2\x80\x9cThese clothes, honestly, are walking pieces of art. It\xe2\x80\x99s the redefinition of sex; the sex of the mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nImage zoom Credit: Mert Alas and Marcus Piggott/Vogue\n\nIn the interview, she recalls her strict and sheltered childhood with her evangelical Christian pastor parents, saying that her schools were \xe2\x80\x9cmakeshift,\xe2\x80\x9d her days were filled with church and watching Bill O\xe2\x80\x99Reilly and she only knew of Madonna and Marilyn Manson because her family \xe2\x80\x9cpicketed their concerts.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut from an early age she had an innate sense of style. In sixth grade she asked for a fake leopard-fur $175 vintage coat for Christmas and Jesus (not Santa Claus, to be clear) brought it to her that year. \xe2\x80\x9cAll the kids made fun of me,\xe2\x80\x9d she says. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I knew I was doing something right when the hot moms came over to me at school and were like, \xe2\x80\x98Where did you get that coat, sweetie?'\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThese days she\xe2\x80\x99s trying to get away from her cartoony style image, opting for fewer \xe2\x80\x9ccutesy\xe2\x80\x9d clothes and more \xe2\x80\x9candrogynous, architectural\xe2\x80\x9d pieces. \xe2\x80\x9cI am happy to be another interpretation of myself,\xe2\x80\x9d she explains.\n\nShe\xe2\x80\x99s been fully delivering on that, making dramatic hair changes on the regular, from going platinum, to getting a pixie, to recently trimming it even shorter (it\xe2\x80\x99s practically a step away from a buzz cut now!).\n\nWhile her working style is getting more and more experimental, she goes super low-key off the clock in an Adidas tracksuit and Stan Smiths, which she wears daily to make paparazzi shots less desirable. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I am on, I am on,\xe2\x80\x9d Perry says. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd when I am not, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a different job to do.

I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t give anything to go back to my 20s; I\xe2\x80\x99m so much more grounded.

That your education can start now.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd after the breakout success of Teenage Dream in 2010, she finally feels like she can slow down a bit. \xe2\x80\x9cI blasted off on a rocket, holding on for dear life,\xe2\x80\x9d she says. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I had so much ambition and determination, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what kept me going. The rocket was riding me for a bit, but now I am riding the rocket.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nYou can pick up the May issue on newsstands April 25 or order it on Amazon here.

"b""'I cannot imagine anyone thinking what was done to Zeke was okay on any level,' says the host about what Jeff Varner did on 'Survivor: Game Changers'\n\nSurvivor type TV Show network CBS genre Reality Where to watch Close Streaming Options\n\nEach week host Jeff Probst will answer a few questions about the most recent episode of Survivor: Game Changers. This week, he gives his on-the-scene and behind-the-scenes insight and reaction to Jeff Varner outing Zeke Smith as transgender.\n\nENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: Okay, so clearly a lot to unpack here with Jeff Varner outing Zeke as trans on national television. Let\xe2\x80\x99s start with your initial reaction when Jeff said that at Tribal Council.\n\nJEFF PROBST: I\xe2\x80\x99m pretty sure my reaction was the same as viewers watching at home. I saw Jeff Varner turn to Zeke and make what was essentially a statement \xe2\x80\x94 vaguely disguised as a question: \xe2\x80\x9cWhy haven\xe2\x80\x99t you told anyone here you\xe2\x80\x99re transgender?\xe2\x80\x9d On one hand, it was such a tiny moment\xe2\x80\xa6 so simple and quiet\xe2\x80\xa6 that I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t certain I heard what I heard. My brain had to rewind and play it back. And if you watch the reaction at Tribal, Zeke\xe2\x80\x99s tribemates seemed to go thru the same moment. They heard it\xe2\x80\xa6 but had to process it\xe2\x80\xa6 and then once it landed they responded quite vocally. And while they were sharing their feelings with Varner, I was still running it in my head. This\xe2\x80\xa6 just\xe2\x80\xa6 happened.\n\nIt seems everyone on the tribe \xe2\x80\x94 Tai, Andrea, Ozzy, Debbie, Sarah \xe2\x80\x94 had their moment of telling Jeff in very strong language that what he did was completely unacceptable. What did you make of what I would describe as their unified disgust at what had happened?\n\nIn 34 seasons of Survivor, I have rarely, if ever, personally commented on what is said or done in the game. But this is a unique situation that falls outside the normal boundaries. I cannot imagine anyone thinking what was done to Zeke was okay on any level, under any circumstances, and certainly not simply because there was a million dollars on the line. I think the response from the tribe, as it so often does, mirrors what the vast majority of society will feel. You just don\xe2\x80\x99t do that to someone.\n\nWitnessing that moment was so powerful because from my seat at Tribal, I could see it all. Varner was in the middle being attacked by angry tribemates while Zeke sat in the corner, outside of the action in what appeared to be a mild state of shock. It was one of the most surreal moments I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever encountered on the show. From the outside, it looked and sounded like a regular Tribal Council but in reality, it was one of the most raw and painful studies of human behavior that has ever happened on Survivor.\n\nZeke was so composed in his response to what Jeff Varner did. How impressed were you with his reaction?\n\nWe knew Zeke was a tremendous storyteller with an amazing ability to take a specific moment from the game or life and give it a universal perspective. That\xe2\x80\x99s why we asked him back to play a second time. And yet I was still blown away by how he handled the entire situation. It was as if he had been preparing for this absolutely unpredictable, completely public, and incredibly vulnerable moment for his entire life. His composure was astounding. And when he connected the entire event to the word metamorphosis, I distinctly remember thinking \xe2\x80\x94 how in the world did you just do that?\n\nI was also very impressed with the compassion Zeke showed Varner. I wonder if some people will say he shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have hugged him or shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have forgiven him. But as a viewer to that moment, I found his ability to still find some level of humanity for someone who had just injured him so severely, maybe his crowning moment.\n\nAnd there is another moment that I hope was as inspiring for others as it was for me, and that was when Sarah told Zeke she was glad she got to know Zeke for who Zeke is and would never see him any other way. That moment \xe2\x80\x94 when a police officer from a conservative Midwest background without much exposure to the \xe2\x80\x9cgay and lesbian and transgender world\xe2\x80\x9d realized her own growth, her own metamorphosis, it completed the circle. This is how change and acceptance happens.\n\nWatch PEN Fan Forum: Survivor, on the new PEOPLE/Entertainment Weekly Network (PEN) here, or download the free app on your Smart TV, mobile and web devices. And check out an exclusive deleted scene at the top of this post.\n\nWhen you spoke with Zeke before his first season during the interview process, did the subject ever come up in terms of whether he planned to tell players he was trans and how he would handle it if someone brought it up?\n\nMy story with Zeke goes like this. I met Zeke in casting and loved him. I still have my original notes from that meeting. He was very engaging, gifted in his ability to manipulate with his words, and he wore this crazy Hawaiian shirt and had poofy hair. We knew we were doing Millennials vs. Gen X as a theme and we wanted him on the Millennials tribe immediately. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t until after he left that I was told he was transgender. From that point forward we agreed that if his story was to be told, he would be the one to decide when, where, and how.\n\nAs for someone else bringing it up, Zeke was fully aware someone might suspect it or bring it up and he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI will deal with it as it arises.\xe2\x80\x9d And I have to add it was never a question of Zeke being worried his story would come out. ,Zeke is a massive Survivor fan and his point with us was very clear \xe2\x80\x94 he wanted to be seen as a Survivor player. Not the first transgender Survivor player. I really respected that distinction and I understood it.\n\nThe tribe was clearly all shaken by this incident. How were you after Tribal Council finished?\n\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t really remember a lot about my own feelings in the moments after Tribal. I remember feeling that Zeke seemed very centered when he left Tribal, despite what he had gone through and I believed his tribemates would help him work through things back at camp. But we were in touch with the producer on the beach that night to just ensure everything was going okay.\n\nAnd then the other concern was Jeff Varner. Although I do not condone on any level what Varner did, I was still aware that he was without any of his support group of family and friends. He would be returning to Ponderosa, where voted out contestants go, after making one of the worst decisions of his life. Fortunately, we have a full-time psychologist on staff who knows all of the contestants and is there to help them through any of the many things that come up on Survivor. I think those sessions in the days after the event helped Varner as he tried to make sense of everything.\n\nHave you spoken to Jeff Varner at all since this incident and do you think he is genuinely mortified by what he did?\n\nI spoke with Varner the day after it happened and I think he was still in a bit of shock. It was clear he was upset and the realization of it all was still washing over him. I do believe he wishes he could take the entire event back. I hope Varner is able to take this moment and turn it into something positive. People make mistakes. Granted this happens to be a pretty severe one, but as you saw even with Zeke \xe2\x80\x94 there is hope that something good can come from this. That would be my wish\xe2\x80\xa6 that Varner will seize this as an opportunity to be a catalyst for positive change by owning his mistake and moving forward in a new direction.\n\nFinally, we always take a sneak peek at what\xe2\x80\x99s coming up. I know we have a merge on the horizon. And I have to imagine the Nuku tribe will still be decompressing from what just happened.\n\nI\xe2\x80\x99m going to break tradition tonight and let the events of this very special episode breathe for a moment. But Survivor will be back next week\xe2\x80\xa6 and someone will be voted out. The game continues."""
"b""\xe2\x80\x93 By the time Harvard students grow bored stealing glances at freshman Malia Obama, they\xe2\x80\x99ll have a new classmate to obsess over, a friend of the former first family with arguably even greater star power.\n\nMinnesota native Yara Shahidi won\xe2\x80\x99t move into the Cambridge, Mass., dorms until next fall, though. She\xe2\x80\x99s taking a gap year to headline a spinoff of her ABC series \xe2\x80\x9cBlack-ish,\xe2\x80\x9d in which her character, Zoey Johnson, heads to college herself.\n\nZoey is far less ambitious than the actress who plays her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOftentimes I\xe2\x80\x99m developing two characters at the same time, figuring out who Yara is and who Zoey is,\xe2\x80\x9d Shahidi said from the Disney Studios, where she\xe2\x80\x99s sprinting back and forth between the sets of the Emmy-nominated \xe2\x80\x9cBlack-ish,\xe2\x80\x9d which returns Tuesday, and her new show \xe2\x80\x9cGrown-ish,\xe2\x80\x9d tentatively scheduled to premiere in January on cable's Freeform.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you make that separation, and embrace this idea that your character is not going to agree with you but still has a valid point of view? It\xe2\x80\x99s been actually kind of fantastic,\xe2\x80\x9d she added before slipping in a reference to the rebellious teen in \xe2\x80\x9cThe Catcher in the Rye,\xe2\x80\x9d a novel she first read when she was 14. \xe2\x80\x9cI kind of see Zoey as my personal-life Holden Caulfield, because you\xe2\x80\x99re allowed to be somebody that you\xe2\x80\x99re not. As a teenager you really don\xe2\x80\x99t have that privilege in many other spaces.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nEven if her new series flunks out with viewers, Shahidi\xe2\x80\x99s future shines bright.\n\nYara Shahidi arrives at the 69th Primetime Emmy Awards on Sept. 17 at the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles.\n\nMichelle Obama was so impressed by the young star\xe2\x80\x99s contributions to her Let Girls Learn Initiative that she wrote Shahidi a college recommendation letter.\n\nThe accolades \xe2\x80\x94 a BET Award, an invitation to speak at a United Nations summit, an Essence Magazine Women in Hollywood Award \xe2\x80\x94 have come largely from her political activism rather than her acting ability. In August, she was recognized at a Black Girls Rock ceremony alongside Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., and Wall Street power broker Suzanne Shank.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c \xe2\x80\x98White\xe2\x80\x99 taught me what \xe2\x80\x98black\xe2\x80\x99 was not,\xe2\x80\x9d the 17-year-old said in her acceptance speech. \xe2\x80\x9c \xe2\x80\x98Male\xe2\x80\x99 taught me what \xe2\x80\x98female\xe2\x80\x99 was not. \xe2\x80\x98Straight\xe2\x80\x99 taught me what \xe2\x80\x98gay\xe2\x80\x99 was not. \xe2\x80\x98Sad\xe2\x80\x99 taught me what \xe2\x80\x98happy\xe2\x80\x99 was not. \xe2\x80\x98Law\xe2\x80\x99 taught me what \xe2\x80\x98equality\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98equity\xe2\x80\x99 were not.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut our charge is not to live within this negative space of who we are not to be. Who are we not to be, after all?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAmong those blown away by her poise and eloquence is Laurence Fishburne, the Oscar-nominated veteran actor who plays her grandfather on \xe2\x80\x9cBlack-ish.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t become president of the United States, something\xe2\x80\x99s wrong,\xe2\x80\x9d Fishburne said. \xe2\x80\x9cPeople like to talk about child actors who don\xe2\x80\x99t do well. Makes better copy, I suppose. But Yara, like Ronnie Howard and Jodie Foster, is really gifted, talented and beautiful. She was kind of born with everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x98She gives me hope\xe2\x80\x99\n\nWhile other teen stars use social media to promote their latest projects, Shahidi is busy retweeting the Dalai Lama, Pakistani female education activist Malala Yousafzai and Rep. Ilhan Omar, DFL-Minneapolis. She announced her plans to attend Harvard to her 1.2 million Instagram followers by quoting James Baldwin.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cEvery time I talk to her, I realize I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what she\xe2\x80\x99s talking about. I need to go grab a book or something,\xe2\x80\x9d said comic Wanda Sykes, a frequent guest star on Shahidi\xe2\x80\x99s series. \xe2\x80\x9cShe gives me hope.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShahidi left Minnesota at age 4, but her work ethic and passion for activism are deeply rooted in the Twin Cities, where her father worked as Prince\xe2\x80\x99s personal photographer and her grandfather still runs a Persian rug store in Uptown. People who tour Paisley Park can see a picture of the young Yara on a table in Prince\xe2\x80\x99s office.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe travel to London and Hawaii set a precedent for how amazing my childhood was,\xe2\x80\x9d said Shahidi during a lunch break from her shooting schedule, which can keep her on set for up to 17 hours a day. \xe2\x80\x9cIt literally opened so many doors.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIt would have been easy to grow up thinking she was born with a purple spoon in her mouth. But backstage access had just the opposite effect.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re just kind of a grounded family,\xe2\x80\x9d said her dad, Afshin Shahidi, whose book, \xe2\x80\x9cPrince: A Private View,\xe2\x80\x9d will be published this month. \xe2\x80\x9cWe didn\xe2\x80\x99t make anyone seem extra-special because of what they did.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nYara\xe2\x80\x99s mother, Keri Shahidi, laid down the law at home, restricting the amount of television her three children could watch. Her oldest daughter was so naive about pop culture that before securing the role as Eddie Murphy\xe2\x80\x99s daughter in the 2009 film \xe2\x80\x9cImagine That,\xe2\x80\x9d she had no idea she would be screen-testing with a comedy legend.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI told her that she was auditioning with the man who voiced the donkey from \xe2\x80\x98Shrek\xe2\x80\x99 and that he looked like my brother,\xe2\x80\x9d Keri Shahidi said. \xe2\x80\x9cShe didn\xe2\x80\x99t know him otherwise.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe two \xe2\x80\x94 who recently staged an impromptu dance party in Yara\xe2\x80\x99s trailer on the \xe2\x80\x9cGrown-ish\xe2\x80\x9d set \xe2\x80\x94 are working on a book about mother-daughter relationships.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe kept all media out of the house,\xe2\x80\x9d Keri Shahidi said. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the way I was raised, and I just carried that tradition on. In our house, quoting James Baldwin is sexy. The correlation between [Voltaire\xe2\x80\x99s] \xe2\x80\x98Candide\xe2\x80\x99 and the existentialism movement, that\xe2\x80\x99s sexy. We were on the beach during family vacation, and the kids were debating socialism, fascism and capitalism.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nFamily on the set\n\nThe parents made sure that family ties transferred to the \xe2\x80\x9cBlack-ish\xe2\x80\x9d workplace, where Shahidi has been employed since she was 14.

"b'""She loved this incredible character she got to create, this force called Leia,"" the actress recalled.\n\nAmongst the many celebrities that we lost in 2016 was Carrie Fisher, whose portrayal of a brave rebel princess was equally as important as her interest in advocating for mental health awareness as well as women\'s rights.

Following George Lucas\' comments on the indelible effect Carrie had on both Star Wars and the entertainment industry at large, Billie addressed the audience with some moving remarks.\n\n""That was why she loved you,"" Billie said to fans, ""because you accepted and embraced all of her: the strong soldier of a woman she was and also the vulnerable side of her who often openly fought her own dark side, knowing early on that we all have a dark side of our own . . . Nothing about her was a performance. She loved you, she loved these movies, she loved the people she got to make them with, and she loved this incredible character she got to create, this force called Leia.""\n\nBillie concluded her speech by reciting Leia\'s legendary plea to Obi-Wan Kenobi.\n\nThe official Star Wars twitter account also posted this moving video homage to Carrie:\n\nIt was recently revealed that the late actress would, in fact, make a a posthumous appearance in Star Wars Episode IX: The Last Jedi, after her family gave Lucasfilm permission to use footage shot before her death.

"b'There\'s a certain expectation that celebrity homes will be three things: grand, expensive and overlooking a stunning view. The Santa Barbara villa belonging to Ellen DeGeneres and Portia de Rossi checks off each of these boxes, but it also comes with a rare, quiet sense of grandeur, emulating the classic style of a 17th-century Italian villa with precision.\n\nThe couple just listed the 10,500-square-foot home for $45 million, and it\'s apparent it was designed to awe. Sitting on what was once two adjacent properties (now a 16.88-acre piece of land), the villa overlooks the ocean and is surrounded by mountains. It has six bedrooms, six full bathrooms and two half bathrooms, plus a fitness room, library, sun room and home office, according to the listing.\n\nJim Bartsch\n\nPerhaps one of the most stunning features is the home\'s seamless integration of outdoor and indoor living \xe2\x80\x94 typical of California design. An alfresco dining area is nestled below mature trees that provide cool shade on hot summer days, a Roman-style pool is surrounded by lush expanses of grass, and olive and eucalyptus trees line the twisting quarter-mile drive to the entry\'s 18th-century Spanish gates.\n\n""The surrounding gardens and olive trees are almost as wonderful as the interior,"" DeGeneres told Sotheby\'s International Realty. ""The house truly feels like it was built out of the landscape, rather than plopped on a plot. It feels ancient, like it\'s been there forever. Like that hill was never without the house. It\'s a home that honors nature, and I love that.""\n\nJim Bartsch\n\nDeGeneres and de Rossi purchased the villa, which was featured in DeGeneres\' book ""Home,"" in 2012 for $26.5 million, according to People. The estate was built in the 1930s by famed American architect Wallace Frost, who had just returned from living in Italy, entranced by the villas there. Decades later, the home was given a five-year restoration by architectural designer John Saladino, who was captivated by its ""mix of grandeur and modesty.""\n\n""The house is always surprising,"" DeGeneres told Sotheby\'s. ""It reveals itself to you in new ways every day. It\'s not overly manicured or tidy. It\'s not overly precious or perfect. And it\'s a home that manages to be both spacious and cozy at once.""\n\nJim Bartsch\n\nOther Italian influences include a classic barrel-tiled roof, wide wood flooring planks, rustic exposed ceiling beans, terra-cotta surfaces, 18th-century Italian tiles, vintage light fixtures and walls of locally quarried stone. Nine fireplaces lend an air of regal warmth to the villa worthy of any royalty \xe2\x80\x94 even Emmy-winning Hollywood royalty.\n\nDeGeneres has made an impression as an incredible house flipper and decorator, with her own home lines ranging from bedding to dining tables. Where she and de Rossi are headed next, we\'re not sure, but it can only be predicted that it will be as intricately designed and beautiful as this home.\n\nItching to see more of the estate?

"b'With Coachella underway our attention has turned to those few days of festival fun that await us, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s a weekend at Wilderness, Glastonbury or further afield.\n\nBut thanks to late nights, copious amounts of booze and nowhere to shower, festivals don\xe2\x80\x99t always lend themselves to the bouncy hair and glowing skin that Kate Moss would have you believe they do. Instead, slumming it is all part of the experience and as such your beauty bag is bound to take a hit. The key here is to pack lightly and keep your look simple with long-wearing products that can take you from day to night.\n\nHere is our list of must-have beauty buys that you\xe2\x80\x99ll actually need this festival season.\n\nDry Shampoo\n\nHair by Sam McKnight, Lazy girl, \xc2\xa319, Liberty London\n\nWith nowhere to wash your locks, beat the grease and cheat your way to achieving salon-worthy hair with the help of a dry shampoo.\n\nA product which has earned a bad reputation over the years for leaving your tresses coated in a chalky, flaky residue, luckily a new generation of products has pretty much changed the hair game. Case in point: Sam McKnight\xe2\x80\x99s Lazy Girl.\n\nThis dry shampoo, while pricier than some, is perfect for making your \xe2\x80\x99do last longer as it absorbs excess oil while simultaneously creating volume, texture and hold. It also smells heavenly, with notes of green leaf, watery flowers, cedar, frankincense and juniper wood.\n\nFace Wipes\n\nTake The Day Off Face and Eye Cleansing Towelettes , \xc2\xa316, Clinique\n\nVery rarely will we advocate using face wipes but festivals are one of those occasions when the need for convenience dominates. That being said, it\xe2\x80\x99s important to remember that not all wipes are created equal.\n\nOne of our favourites is Clinique\xe2\x80\x99s Take The Day Off Face and Eye Cleansing Towelettes, which are saturated with gentle micellar liquid that promises to instantly refresh your complexion. So whether you\xe2\x80\x99re dancing the night away or getting stuck in the mud you can rely on these handy towels to get rid of any festival-related grub in one quick sweep.\n\nWaterproof Mascara\n\nToo Faced, Better Than Sex Waterproof Mascara, \xc2\xa319, Cult Beauty\n\nFrom unexpected downpours to getting emotional mid-ballad as you watch the main stage, your eye makeup needs to ward off the panda effect. As such, only a waterproof formula will do.\n\nFor full, fluttery lashes that promise to stay put all day and night we recommend investing in Too Faced\xe2\x80\x99s Better Than Sex Waterproof Mascara, which uses a peptide-enriched formula to thicken, lengthen and curl. In just a few coats, your eyes will look bigger, brighter and more defined than ever before.\n\nCC Cream\n\nIt Cosmetics, Your Skin But Better CC Cream SPF 50, \xc2\xa330, Selfridges\n\nWearing a full face of makeup is a no-go as festivals call for a pared-back beauty routine. The answer? A CC cream that evens out your complexion and feels super-light on the skin.\n\nOur favourite is It Cosmetics\xe2\x80\x99 Your Skin But Better CC Cream, which brightens, hydrates, protects, evens skin tone, fights wrinkles and instantly diffuses the appearance of fine lines, all without being too heavy. It\xe2\x80\x99s also SPF 50, so you can be safe in the knowledge that on the off-chance there happens to be glorious weather, your skin will be protected.\n\nGlitter\n\nNYX Professional Makeup, Face & Body Glitter, \xc2\xa36, Cult Beauty'"

"b""Barring a fluke, Aquaman will probably cross $500 million worldwide sometime today or very early tomorrow. The DC Films superhero flick has earned $483m worldwide, including $72.7m in its domestic debut, so it should be over/under $80m domestic by the end of today. For reference, National Treasure fell 40% on its first Monday on Christmas Eve after a $44m debut weekend in 2007 while The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, which opened a week earlier in 2012, fell 60% on day four after a then-record $84m Fri-Sun haul. So, yeah, barring an unexpected collapse, the Jason Momoa/Amber Heard adventure is already a sizable hit for the Dream Factory, and it\xe2\x80\x99s on course to be their biggest domestic and global grosser of 2018.\n\nIt is standard practice after any DC Films movie to examine what its success (or relative failure) means for the brand as a whole. It may be too early to explore the long-term impact, but at a glance, DC Films is now in a position where not every film has to justify the entire IP or the overall fate of the studio. Warner Bros. had a pretty damn good 2018, offering a slew of mid-priced domestic winners (A Star Is Born, Crazy Rich Asians, Ocean\xe2\x80\x99s 8) and big-budget tentpoles that did okay in North America and broke big overseas (Ready Player One, The Meg, Rampage) and thus finally declaring that they won\xe2\x80\x99t be entirely defined by DC Films and the J.K. Rowling brand.\n\nOne thing the relative commercial and critical success of Aquaman means is that the series won\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily live or die by the fate of each movie. Maybe Shazam will be another goofy treat, and since it\xe2\x80\x99s from New Line as well as Warner Bros., I\xe2\x80\x99m presuming it\xe2\x80\x99s budgeted closer to The Fellowship of the Ring than The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey. Maybe Todd Phillips' Joker will be a halfway-decent 1980s crime drama that happens to be a Joker origin story. Or perhaps not. But each new film will, as long as some of them are decent (and WB has other IP and non-IP hits to crow about), be allowed to stand on its own without much concern about the overall fate of the brand being taken into account.\n\nCoincidentally enough, today marks 33 months since the release of Zack Snyder\xe2\x80\x99s Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. After Snyder\xe2\x80\x99s Man of Steel earned mixed reviews and grossed \xe2\x80\x9cjust\xe2\x80\x9d $668 million worldwide, Man of Steel 2 morphed first into a Superman sequel that happened to involve Batman and eventually into an official backdoor pilot for the DC Films franchise. So the poor reviews and quick-kill box office ($873m but from a $422m global launch) wasn\xe2\x80\x99t just about whether the movie made money (it did) or justified itself artistically (that\xe2\x80\x99s a coin toss, especially in its compromised theatrical cut), but how it laid the groundwork for the sequels and spin-offs to come. Much of the conversation revolved around what the film said about the overall DC Comics film franchise.\n\nThis is what happens when a studio positions a new biggie as not just a big movie (or even a big sequel) but as a launching pad for a would-be cinematic universe. It was a distinctly less stand-alone movie than, for example, Sony\xe2\x80\x99s The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (whose marketing emphasized the barely-there cinematic universe implications). Superman (Henry Cavill) met Batman (Ben Affleck), Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot) and Lex Luthor (Jesse Eisenberg). We briefly met The Flash (Ezra Miller), Aquaman (Jason Momoa) and Cyborg (Ray Fisher). The film set up a looming threat from Apokolips and hinted at an endgame similar to Injustice: Gods Among Us (a popular DC Comics fighting video game where Superman goes world-crushingly rogue after Lois Lane is murdered).\n\nOh, and it ended with Clark Kent perishing in battle with the presumption that he would be resurrected in Justice League. The grim, hyper-violent and barely comprehensible sequel was discussed in terms of its quality and in terms of what it meant for the overall DC Films franchise. It earned nearly $900 million but was so divisively received that it caused significant changes for Suicide Squad (which ended up being recut by the company that produced the first crowd-pleasing theatrical trailer) and Justice League (where Joss Whedon eventually took over from Zack Snyder and delivered a soft remake of The Avengers). As a backdoor pilot for a cinematic universe that was intended to replace WB\xe2\x80\x99s Harry Potter grosses and stand toe-to-toe with the MCU, it was a disaster.\n\nBut the success of James Wan\xe2\x80\x99s Aquaman, both critically and (thus far) commercially, means two big things for the DC Films franchise. First, it means that they can keep the established continuity intact while going in a different direction (or many different directions) for the likes of Cathy Yan's Birds of Prey, David Sanberg's Shazam and Patty Jenkins' Wonder Woman 1984. It may not have \xe2\x80\x9csaved the DCEU,\xe2\x80\x9d but it most certainly saved the DC Films continuity and prevented a more overt reboot. Ditto (presumably) Shazam, whose trailer explicitly references the events of Batman v Superman even while telling a more kid-friendly adventure fantasy. Secondly, for what it\xe2\x80\x99s worth, it means we can now judge Dawn of Justice as its own thing instead of a foundation for a rickety house.\n\nAs a stand-alone film, even the 180-minute (and R-rated) \xe2\x80\x9cultimate edition\xe2\x80\x9d has many of the same problems it did 2.5-years-ago. The critical title fight is still based on miscommunication and misdirection, so it\xe2\x80\x99s not really the Man of Steel and the Dark Knight wanting to beat the hell out of each other. The first two hours is mostly just Lex Luthor (an underrated turn from Eisenberg) slaughtering innocents behind the scenes while Batman and Superman blame each other and brood. The desire to make Luthor into a full-blown puppet master makes the plot more complicated and confusing than it needed to be. And, like Man of Steel (and Chris Nolan\xe2\x80\x99s The Dark Knight Rises), the film\xe2\x80\x99s first plot-filled/character-centric half is more compelling than its action-packed second half.\n\nAbsent the misguided notion of introducing a four-quadrant super-franchise with a film like Batman v Superman, the picture works as an Elseworlds movie. It is still one of the most beautiful-looking superhero movies I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever seen, and how I wish Larry Fong had shot Justice League too. While too many superhero team-up movies and shows tend to isolate their heroes and minimize their contact with the outside world, Batman v Superman has a sprawling supporting cast and is as much about the regular people as it is about Batman and Superman. As a visually-majestic and highly quotable superhero drama that blends gritty realism with apocalyptic fantasy while trying to examine Superman\xe2\x80\x99s role in a world where his every action is politicized, it\xe2\x80\x99s at worst a noble failure.\n\nLike Ang Lee\xe2\x80\x99s Hulk or even Jon Favreau\xe2\x80\x99s Iron Man 2 (which is a superhero sequel as a sitcom bottle episode), Zack Snyder\xe2\x80\x99s second DC Films movie is an engrossing misfire both for what it attempts and beautiful it often looks and sounds. There\xe2\x80\x99s certainly nothing else like it in the sub-genre. It will likely age well as its own thing now that it no longer carries the burden of an entire cinematic universe (and arguably an entire movie studio) on its doomed, misguided shoulders. That it turned out to be the most potent (and sadly accurate) political metaphor for the 2016 presidential election (Batman = Sanders, Superman = Clinton, Luthor = Trump) of that year only adds to its skewed legacy. And now Aquaman has set it free."""
"b'The big question regarding last night\xe2\x80\x99s Survivor scandal, in which contestant Zeke Smith was outed as trans by his fellow contestant Jeff Varner, was how much culpability could be placed on CBS for airing the outing of a man who started his lengthy Hollywood Reporter essay on the matter with, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not wild about you knowing that I\xe2\x80\x99m trans.\xe2\x80\x9d Writing about this earlier today, I wondered how much agency Smith had in this matter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSmith was asked a question about this on Thursday\xe2\x80\x99s episode of The Talk (which, like Survivor, airs on CBS), though I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid we\xe2\x80\x99re no closer to understanding exactly went on behind the scenes. On the talk show, Julie Chen asked Smith if he ever asked Jeff Probst or the show\xe2\x80\x99s producers not air the segment that effectively outed him to the world. Smith\xe2\x80\x99s answer is transcribed in full below:\n\nI love Survivor and I was drawn to apply to Survivor because of the integrity in the storytelling. And when I first applied, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t tell casting that I was trans. That was developed later in our relationship. And I had a chat with Jeff Probst in which we agreed if, how, and when I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna talk about this part of my life\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s gonna be up to me, as opposed to being outed by a fellow contestant being the exception. But in the aftermath of being outed, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been granted unprecedented autonomy in how I wanted to tell my story. We started having conversations all the way back in Fiji nine months ago about the care with which this episode was going to be handled. I came to Jeff and asked if I could write a personal essay about what happened and he immediately said yes. And I was really proud of how I responded. And I wanted the world to see how much I\xe2\x80\x99d grown and I also thought by showing what happened, maybe it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t happen to someone else and something good could come of it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo that\xe2\x80\x99s neither a yes or no, and in many ways brings up more questions, such how these conversations started all those months ago after the events that aired during the episode took place. Was it with CBS saying, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, we\xe2\x80\x99re definitely airing this footage, so you can either work with us or...not\xe2\x80\x9d? Now that both Varner and Smith have explained themselves, it seems that CBS should take some responsibility and do the same.'"

"b'Girllll let me tell you something about this stuff . Get it ! because it green my hair from 13 inches to 17 inches in three months (4 entire inches) I applied it every day between wash days . What you need to do is spray that scalp with some water first to get things going & open pores on scalp. I apply generously because I\xe2\x80\x99m heavy handed . And I have 4a , 4b , some 4c Hair . This stuf is no joke . And it makes your hair thick. You know how I know because I apply about a dime size amount to each section on the length of my Hair and that Hair got much thicker too. It has some type of thickening agent in it. So not only will you get inches you\xe2\x80\x99ll get density. Watch the YouTube videos on this it\xe2\x80\x99s the truth. Like I said I\xe2\x80\x99m heavy handed and I go through a tube in a week to 9 days max. And yes it\xe2\x80\x99s minty on your scalp . It grows brows . Don\xe2\x80\x99t be afraid of the petroleum it\xe2\x80\x99s just fine . And I\xe2\x80\x99m very much an organic natural. But it works, so I just make sure I deeply wash the length of my hair every week with a rhassoul clay and aloe Vera juice wash and an organic shampoo on my scalp I use camille Rose naturals. I wear wigs so I just apply , twist (4 sections) then tie my chunky twists back in a bun , pop a wig cap on , slap my wig on and I\xe2\x80\x99m good to go . If I\xe2\x80\x99m not going anywhere I just wear a low twisted bun .'"

"b'American actress\n\nKeri Lynn Russell (born March 23, 1976)[1] is an American actress. She came to fame for portraying the title role of Felicity Porter on the WB drama series Felicity (1998\xe2\x80\x932002), for which she won a Golden Globe Award. Russell also starred as KGB agent Elizabeth Jennings on the FX spy thriller series The Americans (2013\xe2\x80\x932018), for which she was nominated for Primetime Emmy and Golden Globe Awards.\n\nRussell has appeared in several films, including Mission: Impossible III (2006), Waitress (2007), August Rush (2007), Extraordinary Measures (2010), Dawn of the Planet of the Apes (2014), Free State of Jones (2016), and Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker (2019). In 2017, she received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.[2]\n\nEarly life [ edit ]\n\nKeri Lynn Russell was born on March 23, 1976, in Fountain Valley, California, the daughter of Stephanie Stephens, a homemaker, and David Russell, a Nissan Motors executive.[3] She has an older brother, Todd, and a younger sister, Julie. The family lived in Coppell, Texas; Mesa, Arizona; and Highlands Ranch, Colorado, moving frequently due to her father\'s work. Russell\'s dancing earned her a spot on The Mickey Mouse Club.[4]\n\nCareer [ edit ]\n\nRussell first appeared on television at age 15 as a cast member of the All-New Mickey Mouse Club variety show on the Disney Channel.[5] She was on the show from 1991 to 1994, encompassing seasons four to six.\n\nIn 1992, Russell appeared in Honey, I Blew Up the Kid and in 1993, she had a role on the sitcom Boy Meets World as character Mr. Feeny\'s niece. Russell appeared on Married... with Children in a 1995 episode (""Radio Free Trumaine"", production 9.24). She subsequently starred in several film and television roles, including the 1996 made-for-television film The Babysitter\'s Seduction.[4] That year she also had a role on the short-lived soap opera series Malibu Shores.[4]\n\nIn 1994, Russell appeared as the ""other woman"" in Bon Jovi\'s music video ""Always"".[6] In 1997, she appeared in two episodes of Roar.[4]\n\nFrom 1998 to 2002, Russell starred as the title character on the successful WB Network series Felicity. In 1999, she won a Golden Globe for the role. Russell\'s long, curly hair was one of her character\'s defining characteristics, and her hairstyle change at the beginning of the show\'s second season was speculated by some to have caused a significant drop in the show\'s ratings.[7]\n\nDuring the show\'s run, Russell appeared in the films Eight Days a Week, The Curve, and Mad About Mambo, all of which received only limited releases in North America. Her next role was in the film We Were Soldiers (2002),[4] playing the wife of a United States serviceman during the Vietnam War. The film was released two months before the end of Felicity\'s run.\n\nWhen Felicity ended, Russell moved to New York City and made her off-Broadway stage debut in 2004 in Neil LaBute\'s Fat Pig.[8] In 2005, she returned to television and film, beginning with an appearance in the Hallmark Hall of Fame television movie The Magic of Ordinary Days, theatrical film The Upside of Anger, and the television miniseries Into the West. Directing Mission: Impossible III in 2005, J. J. Abrams asked Russell to join the cast and she accepted. She was screen tested for the role of Lois Lane in Superman Returns, but lost the role to Kate Bosworth.[9]\n\nIn mid-2006, Russell was chosen to be a celebrity spokeswoman for CoverGirl cosmetics.[10] In the summer of 2007, Russell appeared in The Keri Kronicles, a reality show sitcom sponsored by CoverGirl and airing on MySpace; the show was filmed at Russell\'s home in Manhattan and spotlighted her life.[11] Also in 2007, she played Melody on the NBC show Scrubs.\n\nRussell next starred in the film Waitress, which marked the fourth time she played a pregnant woman.[12] Her performance was positively received by critics,[11] with Michael Sragow of The Baltimore Sun writing that Russell\'s performance had ""aesthetic character"" and ""wields tenderness and fierceness with quiet heat"".[13] In 2007, Russell also completed roles in Grimm Love (titled Rohtenburg for its German release), in which she played Katie Armstrong, a graduate student who writes her thesis on an infamous cannibal murder case, and the thriller The Girl in the Park.\n\nRussell next appeared in August Rush, released in November 2007. She also appeared on the cover of the New York Post\'s Page Six magazine on November 11, 2007.[14] Russell later appeared in Bedtime Stories.[15] In an appearance on The View on December 15, 2008, Russell said she got the part because Adam Sandler\'s wife Jackie had seen her in Waitress and suggested her for the movie. Russell voiced Wonder Woman in a direct-to-video animated feature released on March 3, 2009.[16]\n\nRussell starred in the Tom Vaughan-helmed Extraordinary Measures[17][18] for CBS Films. The drama, which started filming on April 6, 2009, and was released on January 22, 2010, was the first film to go into production for the new company.[4][19] Russell played Aileen Crowley, a mother who tries to build a normal home life for her sick children while her husband and an unconventional scientist race against time to find a cure.[20]\n\nRussell starred in the Fox series Running Wilde from 2010 to 2011.[21]\n\nFrom 2013 to 2018, she starred in the FX drama series The Americans, playing Elizabeth Jennings, a deep-undercover Russian KGB spy living as an American in the 1980s Cold War era. She appeared opposite Matthew Rhys, who portrays her character\'s husband and spy partner. Russell and Rhys became partners in real life during this time. The series ended after six seasons.[22]\n\nIn 2013, Russell starred in the science-fiction horror film Dark Skies and the romantic comedy film Austenland. In 2014, Russell starred in the science fiction action film Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, a sequel to the 2011 film Rise of the Planet of the Apes.[23] She later starred as Serena Knight in the 2016 historical war film Free State of Jones.\n\nIn July 2018, Russell was announced to have joined the cast of the film Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, which was released on December 20, 2019.

"b'Fictional character in Star Wars\n\nRey, also known as Rey Skywalker,[10] is a fictional character in the Star Wars franchise and the main protagonist of the sequel film trilogy. She was created by Lawrence Kasdan, J. J. Abrams, and Michael Arndt for The Force Awakens (2015), the first installment of the trilogy, and is portrayed by Daisy Ridley.[1][11][12][13] She also appears in the film\'s sequels, The Last Jedi (2017) and The Rise of Skywalker (2019), and related Star Wars media.\n\nRey is introduced as a scavenger who was left behind on the planet Jakku when she was a child. She later becomes involved with the Resistance\'s conflict with the First Order. Powerful with the Force, Rey trains to be a Jedi under Luke Skywalker and General Leia, and faces adversaries such as Supreme Leader Snoke, Kylo Ren, and the resurrected Emperor Palpatine; the latter is revealed to be her grandfather in The Rise of Skywalker. Rey later adopts the name ""Skywalker"" to honor her mentors and the family legacy.[8][10]\n\nReception to the character and Ridley\'s performance has been highly positive. Ridley has garnered multiple accolades for her performances as Rey, including two Saturn Award nominations.\n\nDevelopment\n\nCreation and casting\n\nEpisode VII Rey\'s costume from\n\nScreenwriter Michael Arndt said that he found Lucasfilm President Kathleen Kennedy\'s offer to write Episode VII daunting in mid-2012, but he became interested when it was explained to him that the tale was about the origin story of a female Jedi and he met with George Lucas.[14] The character was known as Kira in the early stages of production, and Arndt described her as a ""loner, hothead, gear-head, badass"". Arndt said that he struggled with introducing the young woman as the main character in his story while keeping her from being overshadowed after her early meeting with Luke Skywalker, whose role in the film was eventually minimized.[14] Ridley recalled that director and writer J. J. Abrams originally intended to name the character ""Keera"" [sic], but during filming in Abu Dhabi, Abrams revealed to Ridley that he was thinking of going with ""Rey"".[16]\n\nOn creating a female lead for the new trilogy, Abrams stated that from his initial discussions with writer Lawrence Kasdan, he was excited at the concept of having a woman at the center of the story. He said that ""We always wanted to write Rey as the central character"" and that other female representation in the story was also important.[1] Kennedy stated that, ""Rey is the new generation\'s Luke Skywalker.""[17] Rey\'s background as a scavenger was part of the developers attempting to portray her as ""the ultimate outsider and the ultimate disenfranchised person"", due to their belief that a person of that nature would likely experience a prolonged journey compared to other types of people.[18]\n\nDaisy Ridley was largely unknown before being cast for the role of Rey. Ridley said that she auditioned many times for the role over the course of seven months and had to keep her casting a secret for three months.[19] She was announced as part of the cast at the end of April 2014. She only had experience with small parts in TV shows. Her inexperience and lack of exposure were a crucial part of what convinced Abrams to give Ridley the role, as the previous installments had featured relatively unknown talent that would not experience heightened degrees of scrutiny.[20] Abrams stated that Ridley ""was so funny and had a great spark"", as well as having her act out an emotional scene, proclaiming that ""she nailed it on the first take."" Abrams went on to praise Ridley, saying, ""She was born with this gift to be in a moment and make it her own. She simultaneously works from the inside out and the outside in.""[21] Kennedy proclaimed, ""Daisy had a physicality and a self-confidence that was so important to the character we were looking for. She epitomizes that optimism where anything is possible.""[21] Director Dusan Lazarevic, who was present at the casting of Ridley for a role in British drama series Silent Witness, in addition to praising her acting range, stated, ""She showed a combination of vulnerability and strength which gave her a complexity, and there was an intelligence in her eyes that was an indicator she could play quite a complicated part.""[20] Cailey Fleming was additionally cast to portray a young Rey.[2]\n\nAlthough Ridley said she was ""riddled with doubts and insecurities"", she said that Rey\'s hopefulness is what she related to most: it ""was something driving me through the auditions\xe2\x80\x94even though it felt so insanely out of anything that I could\'ve imagined.""[22] Ridley recalled her shooting experience as starting off bumpy, with Abrams telling her that her first few takes were ""wooden"".[23] But Ridley and Abrams had an ""incredibly collaborative"" process creating Rey; Ridley recalled that the character ""changed from when we first began, she became softer. And I think that\'s probably me, because Americans tend not to understand me, so it helped, slowing down the speech and everything just made it softer than I am.""[22] Ridley has said that Rey will have ""some impact in a girl power-y way"", adding that the character ""doesn\'t have to be one thing to embody a woman in a film. It just so happens she\'s a woman but she transcends gender. She\'s going to speak to men and women.""[24] In an interview with Elle, Ridley said, ""She\'s so strong. She\'s cool and smart and she can look after herself,"" adding, ""Young girls can look at her and know that they can wear trousers if they want to. That they don\'t have to show off their bodies.""[21]\n\nComposer John Williams said he immediately loved Ridley in the film and found composing her theme an interesting challenge. He said that her theme does not suggest a love theme, but rather a strong female adventurer character infused with the Force for a mature, thoughtful theme.[25] He added that the ""musical grammar"" of Rey\'s theme is not heroic, but conveys ""an adventurous tone that needs to illustrate empathy.""[26]\n\nCharacterization\n\nRey is introduced as a 19-year-old woman in The Force Awakens.[27] She is stubborn, headstrong, brave, optimistic, and maintains fierce loyalty to her friends. Matthew Yglesias of Vox wrote, ""Rey is considerably less callow than Luke"".[28] Ridley says of the character, ""It\'s not because Rey is strong that she\'s amazing. It\'s all the complexities of a human. It\'s because she is a well-drawn person who is struggling with things and you\'re with her.""[29]\n\nRey is highly Force-sensitive, which is revealed when she is presented with the lightsaber first owned by Anakin Skywalker, then his son Luke.[30] Without training, she is able to use advanced Force abilities and even defeat Kylo Ren in a duel, though he was already injured and using his power of the dark side to fight being weakened by his pain.[31]\n\nAppearances\n\nFilm\n\nThe Force Awakens (2015)\n\nRey is first introduced as an orphan living alone on the desert planet Jakku, scraping a living through scavenging parts from ships. She rescues the astromech droid BB-8 and encounters Finn (John Boyega), a former stormtrooper. Attacked by First Order troops, Rey steals and pilots the Millennium Falcon to evade them and escape Jakku. Smuggler Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Wookiee Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) take back the Falcon in their freighter ship. She saves Finn and they escape the freighter in the Falcon. Impressed with Rey\'s bravery and piloting skill, Han offers her a job on the Falcon; however, Rey declines his offer, feeling that she has to return to Jakku.\n\nAfter they convene at Maz Kanata\'s (Lupita Nyong\'o) castle on the planet Takodana to return BB-8 to the Resistance, the First Order is alerted to their presence. Rey visits the castle\'s basement vault in which Maz has stored a lightsaber that once belonged to Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) and his father before him. Upon touching it, she experiences a terrifying vision: she sees a battle led by First Order enforcer Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), a flashback of her younger self being left behind on Jakku, and a vision of Luke, the last Jedi Master in the galaxy, who has been missing for several years. Maz debates that whoever abandoned her will never return to Jakku, and her only option is to seek out strength in the Force. Feeling overwhelmed, Rey rejects the lightsaber and flees into the forest.\n\nThe First Order attacks Maz\'s castle, and Ren captures Rey when the Resistance arrives. Ren takes her to Starkiller Base, where he probes her mind for the map piece that BB-8 showed her. Ren uses the Force to read Rey\'s mind, revealing Rey feels that Han is like the father she never had. Rey then resists him and reads Ren\'s emotions, exposing his fear that he will never be as powerful as his grandfather, Darth Vader. Ren reports to his master, Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis), who commands that Rey should be brought before him. Left alone with a stormtrooper guarding her, Rey uses a Jedi mind trick to get him to help free her. After sneaking around inside the base looking for a way to escape, she is elated to find Finn, Han, and Chewbacca have come for her. They watch in horror as Ren kills his own father, Han.\n\nAs they try to escape the base through the woods, Ren challenges Rey and Finn, using his lightsaber. After Ren seriously injures Finn and disarms him of Luke\'s lightsaber, Rey uses the Force to retrieve the weapon and battles Ren herself. Initially overpowered, Rey rejects Ren\'s offer to train her and uses the Force with the lightsaber, disfiguring his face. After escaping the destroyed base in the Millennium Falcon with Chewbacca and the wounded Finn, she returns to the Resistance base. While the Resistance celebrates the victory, Rey mourns Han\'s death with Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher) and visits Finn, who is still unconscious. She decides to seek out Luke\'s location, using information provided by BB-8 and the re-activated R2-D2 (Kenny Baker). Rey, Chewbacca, and R2 travel in the Falcon to the oceanic planet of Ahch-To; upon finding Luke, Rey presents him with his longtime lightsaber.\n\nRelated works and merchandising\n\nRey is featured in Star Wars: Before the Awakening (2015) by Greg Rucka, an anthology book for young readers that focuses on the lives of Poe, Rey and Finn before the events of The Force Awakens.[32] Rey\'s Survival Guide (2015) by Jason Fry is a first-person account from Rey\'s perspective about herself and her home planet of Jakku.[33] Rey is also a point of view character in the 2015 novelization of The Force Awakens by Alan Dean Foster.[34]\n\nFans noticed a lack of tie-in toys featuring Rey.[35] Hasbro released a version of Monopoly based on The Force Awakens that excluded the Rey character. After receiving criticism, Hasbro stated that they did not include Rey to avoid revealing spoilers, and would be including Rey in future toy releases.[36] Paul Southern, the head of Lucasfilm Licensing, said that they wanted to protect the secrets that ""the Force awakens in Rey"" and that her character carries a lightsaber.[37] He said that demand for Rey products was underestimated.[38][39] Abrams said, ""I will say that it seems preposterous and wrong that the main character of the movie is not well represented in what is clearly a huge piece of the Star Wars world in terms of merchandising.""[12] Regarding Rey\'s relative absence in Star Wars merchandising, CBBC presenter and voice actor Christopher Johnson stated: ""It still baffles me to this day that some toy manufacturers don\'t think that girls want to play with \'superhero\' toys and that boys aren\'t interested in female characters.""[40]\n\nThe Last Jedi (2017)\n\nRey is one of the key characters of The Last Jedi. Picking up directly where the previous installment left off, Rey presents Luke with his lightsaber, but Luke dismissively throws it aside. Luke eventually agrees to teach Rey the ways of the Force. Rey demonstrates immense raw strength and a clear temptation toward the dark side of the Force that reminds Luke of Kylo Ren, who was once his nephew and student, Ben Solo. All the while, Rey feels a sudden connection through the Force with Ren, who tells her that Luke tried to kill him while he was the Jedi master\xe2\x80\x99s student (Luke later tells her that he was tempted to kill Ben after seeing a vision of the pain and suffering he would cause, but relented). In one of their conversations, Rey and Ren touch hands, and through this Rey swears that she is able to feel conflict within Ren, and becomes determined to turn him back to the light side. Rey asks Luke once more to come with her and rejoin the Resistance, but he declines. So, Rey, Chewbacca, and R2-D2 leave without him, and Rey goes to meet Ren in the Supremacy.\n\nRen takes Rey prisoner and brings her before Snoke. Snoke tells her that he created the Force connection between her and Ren as a trap to reach Luke. Snoke tortures and taunts Rey, showing her the attack on the Resistance transports, and eventually orders Ren to kill her. Ren instead kills Snoke, and he and Rey fight Snoke\'s guards side by side. After the duo won, Ren asks Rey to join him and create a new order separate from the legacies of Snoke and Luke, but Rey refuses. In an attempt to get her to turn, Ren gets Rey to admit that her parents abandoned her. Despite the revelation, Rey refuses to join him and uses the Force to summon Luke\'s lightsaber, but Ren does so, too, resulting in a standoff that ultimately breaks the lightsaber. Shortly afterwards, Resistance leader Vice Admiral Holdo (Laura Dern) rams her cruiser into Snoke\'s flagship, separating Rey from Ren. Rey subsequently uses Snoke\'s escape craft to flee the dreadnought as later stated by General Hux.\n\nRey is later revealed to have made her way back to the Millennium Falcon, aiding the Resistance in fighting the First Order\xe2\x80\x99s troops during the Battle of Crait. Despite their valiant efforts, the Resistance loses the battle, and Rey focuses her efforts on finding the surviving Resistance fighters to help evacuate them. Eventually, she finds the Resistance fighters behind a dead-end, and uses the Force to move the rocky barrier aside, clearing the path for them to board the Falcon. Rey reunites with Finn and Leia and meets Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) for the first time aboard the Falcon. Rey feels Luke\xe2\x80\x99s death through the Force, and reassures Leia that he met his end with ""peace and purpose"". As she holds the leftovers of Luke\'s lightsaber, Rey asks Leia how they can rebuild the Resistance from what remains, and Leia, gesturing towards Rey, says that they now have all they need. Unbeknownst to Leia, that includes the fact that Rey stole the sacred Jedi texts from Luke before Yoda\'s (Frank Oz) ghost burned the tree cave they were in.[41]\n\nThe Rise of Skywalker (2019)\n\nRey is the main protagonist of the trilogy\'s final film, The Rise of Skywalker, which is set one year after the events of The Last Jedi. Rey is continuing her Jedi training at the Resistance base under the tutelage of Leia. The Resistance announces that the resurrected Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) has been manipulating events from the Sith world Exegol and has built a secret armada of Star Destroyers, the Final Order. Rey discovers from Luke\'s old notes that a Sith wayfinder can lead them to Exegol. Rey, Finn, Poe, Chewbacca, C-3PO, and BB-8 leave for Pasaana, where a clue to the wayfinder\'s location is hidden. Rey locates the clue\xe2\x80\x94a dagger with Sith inscriptions\xe2\x80\x94with the help of Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams). Meanwhile, Rey continues communicating with Ren; through this correspondence, Ren learns where Rey is and comes for her. Rey confronts Ren, inadvertently allowing Chewbacca to be taken aboard a First Order transport. Attempting to save Chewbacca, Rey accidentally destroys the transport with Force lightning, seemingly killing him. Rey is stricken with guilt and reveals to Finn that she has been having visions of herself and Ren sitting on the Sith throne.\n\nRey and the others travel to Kijimi, where programmer Babu Frik extracts the location of the wayfinder\xe2\x80\x94the moon Kef Bir[42]\xe2\x80\x94from C-3PO\'s memory files. Ren and the First Order follow Rey to Kijimi. Rey senses Chewbacca is alive and the group mounts a rescue mission. Rey retrieves the dagger aboard Ren\'s Resurgent-class Star Destroyer Steadfast and has visions of her parents being killed with it; Ren informs her that she is Palpatine\'s granddaughter. Palpatine had fathered a son who renounced him; he and his wife hid Rey on Jakku, assuming lives as ""nobodies"" to protect her. Palpatine eventually found Rey\'s parents and had them killed, but never found Rey. Ren also reveals that as the grandchildren of Sith Lords, their connection is actually a dyad in the Force. Ren urges her to join him so they can overthrow Palpatine and take the throne of the Sith together, but Rey refuses and escapes aboard the Millennium Falcon with her friends.\n\nTogether, they travel to Kef Bir where Rey retrieves the wayfinder on the remains of the second Death Star; upon touching the artifact, she has a vision of herself as a Sith. Having tracked them, Ren destroys the wayfinder and duels Rey. Leia, dying, calls to Ren through the Force; Rey impales him as he is distracted. Also sensing Leia\'s death, Rey realizes what she did to Ren and regrets impaling him. She uses the Force to heal him and confesses that she did want to join him as Ben Solo before escaping aboard his TIE fighter. Disturbed by her Sith lineage, Rey exiles herself on Ahch-To. Luke\'s Force spirit encourages her to face Palpatine and gives her Leia\'s lightsaber and his old X-wing. Rey departs for Exegol with the wayfinder from Ren\'s ship. Meanwhile, Ren resumes his true identity as Ben Solo.\n\nRey transmits her coordinates to the Resistance, allowing them to launch an offensive against the Sith Eternal forces. Rey confronts Palpatine, who demands she kill him in anger for his spirit to pass into her, making her ""Empress Palpatine"". However, Ben arrives and joins Rey. Palpatine absorbs their life energy to restore his full power and incapacitates Ben. He then attacks the Resistance fleet with Force lightning. Weakened, Rey hears the voices of past Jedi, who restore her strength. Palpatine attacks her with lightning, but Rey deflects it using Luke and Leia\'s lightsabers, killing him and herself. Ben sacrifices himself using the remaining of his energy to revive her using the Force; Rey kisses Ben before he vanishes into the Force. Rey then returns to the Resistance base and reunites with her friends, celebrating their victory against Palpatine and the Sith Eternal.\n\nSometime later, Rey visits Luke\'s abandoned childhood home on Tatooine and buries the Skywalker lightsabers, having built her own in a golden color.[43] A passerby asks Rey her name; after seeing the Force spirits of Luke and Leia, she responds, ""Rey Skywalker"".[44]\n\nRelated works\n\nThe novelization of The Rise of Skywalker reveals that Rey\'s father was a nonidentical clone of Palpatine.[45] An upcoming issue of the comic book series Star Wars Adventures will feature a story set after the events of the film featuring Rey, Finn, and Poe continuing to fight the First Order.[46]\n\nTelevision\n\nStar Wars Rebels (2014)\n\nRey makes a brief cameo as a disembodied voice in the television series Star Wars Rebels, in the episode ""A World Between Worlds"".[5] In the episode, set 16 years before her birth and 35 years before The Force Awakens, the young padawan Ezra Bridger briefly hears some of her lines from the film (specifically her speaking to the unconscious Finn at the end) in the World Between Worlds, a dimension that exists outside of time and space.[5][47]\n\nForces of Destiny (2017)\n\nRey stars in the micro-series Star Wars Forces of Destiny, voiced by Daisy Ridley.[3]\n\nVideo games\n\nThe character of Rey appears in the video games Disney Infinity 3.0, Lego Star Wars: The Force Awakens, and Star Wars Battlefront II (2017), all voiced by Ridley,[48] as well as in the strategy video game Star Wars: Force Arena.[49] The character was also introduced as a player ""skin"" in the game Fortnite.[50]\n\nReception\n\nGeneral\n\nThe character and Ridley\'s portrayal have received critical acclaim. Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal proclaimed that Rey is ""a woman warrior with the stylish ferocity of a kung-fu star,"" praising ""the verve [Ridley] must have been born with plus the skill she must have acquired as a young actress coming up in England,"" and stating, ""It\'s hard to imagine what the movie\xe2\x80\x94and the sequels to come\xe2\x80\x94might have been if they\'d cast the wrong person, but here Daisy Ridley is in all her unassuming glory, and all\'s right with the galaxy.""[51] Adam Howard of MSNBC stated that ""one of the most pleasant surprises of the film has been the strength of its lead female character,"" adding that some have likened Rey to a ""new feminist icon"".[52] Relatedly, Emily Rome of HitFix argued that Rey is ""everything we wanted in a Star Wars female character,"" praising her for being a character that is ""independent, skilled, scrappy, tough, and doesn\'t need saving.""[53] In a personal essay, Nicole Sperling of Entertainment Weekly wrote about her daughters feeling empowered after viewing the film, stating, ""They never commented on how pretty Rey is. They never had to flinch because Rey was a sexual object to some man in power. They just felt strong. Equal.""[54]\n\nMegan Garber of The Atlantic wrote that Rey ""proves herself to be, in extremely short order, extremely adept as a fighter"".[55] Some fans opined that Rey is too skilled despite her inexperience during The Force Awakens, making her a Mary Sue. Rome wrote that ""the speed with which Rey mastered Jedi mind tricks and lightsaber fighting with zero training is the stuff of fan fiction. Rey is geek feminist wish-fulfillment.""[53] Tasha Robinson of The Verge said that Rey ""keeps falling into standard-issue damsel-in-distress situations, then capably rescuing herself.""[56] Robinson wrote ""Rey is kind of a Mary Sue character"" and that ""She\'s a fantasy wish-fulfillment character with outsized skills, an inhuman reaction time, and a clever answer to every question\xe2\x80\x94but so are the other major Star Wars heroes.""[56] Other outlets, including Ridley herself, have argued that the term Mary Sue carries an inherent gender bias,[57] and that the male characters from the original trilogy did not face comparable criticism.[58][59] J. J. Abrams stated that ""the people who are getting freaked out are the people who are accustomed to [male] privilege, and this is not oppression, this is about fairness."" He elaborated, ""You can probably look at the first [Star Wars] movie that George [Lucas] did and say that Leia was too outspoken, or she was too tough. Anyone who wants to find a problem with anything can find the problem. The internet seems to be made for that.""[60] Adrienne Tyler of Screen Rant argued Rey\'s abilities are explained in The Rise of Skywalker as resulting from the pair forming a dyad in the Force, sharing the same fighting capabilities.[61]\n\nRey\'s unique hairstyle attracted attention before and after The Force Awakens was released,[62] being compared to Leia\'s hairdo from the original film, with debate over whether it would become as popular.[63] Rey has also been compared to the titular character from the Hayao Miyazaki anime film Nausica\xc3\xa4 of the Valley of the Wind (1984).[64]\n\nRichard Roeper described Ridley\'s portrayal of Rey as ""a breakout performance"", continuing by calling the character ""tough and resourceful and smart and brave"".[65] Ridley was nominated for a 2016 Saturn Award for Best Actress for her portrayal.[66] The first Reel Women in Technology Award for a fictional character was awarded to the character Rey.[67]\n\nSome fans criticized Rey\'s trilogy-wide character arc as insufficient. Fan fiction author Ricca said that tension that was built in the first two films never gets resolved in the last film. She wanted a moment at the end of The Rise of Skywalker in which Rey reacts to and reflects on everything that has happened to her.[68]\n\nSome critics and fans have noted a visual resemblance between Rey\'s character design to that of Bastila Shan from the video game Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, and that her character arc shares thematic similarities with that of Bastila\'s.[69][70][71][72]\n\nParentage\n\nThe question of Rey\'s parentage was a significant point of discussion for the series, and spawned numerous fan theories.[73][74] The most popular theories were that she is the daughter of Luke Skywalker or Han Solo, or is Obi-Wan Kenobi\'s granddaughter (because of a scene where Rey hears Kenobi\'s echoed voice following a vision in The Force Awakens).[73][75][76] The view that she is Luke\'s daughter was especially prominent, with fans and critics highlighting their story arc similarities, Star Wars being a Skywalker saga, Rey having a strong attachment to Luke\'s lightsaber, and being exceptionally strong with the Force without any training.[75][76][77] Some fan theories about Rey\'s parentage pointed to ""Rey\'s Theme"" featured in John Williams\' score of The Force Awakens, as the theme shared similarities with the themes for Darth Vader and Luke.[78]\n\nAbrams stated that he intentionally withheld Rey\'s last name and background in The Force Awakens.[79] He said that he felt that the origin of Kylo Ren was the only thing that could be revealed in his film and that he knew ""quite a bit"" about Rey\'s origin but would give courtesy to The Last Jedi director Rian Johnson by not saying any more.[80][81] Former Star Wars: Episode IX director Colin Trevorrow stated that the answer of Rey\'s origin would be ""deeply and profoundly satisfying"" and that Rey is ""important in this universe, not just in the context of The Force Awakens, but in the entire galaxy. She deserves it.""[82] Ridley said that she knew who Rey\'s parents were.[19]\n\nIn The Last Jedi, Rey is coaxed by Kylo Ren into admitting that her parents were ""nobodies"". Emily VanDerWerff of Vox equated this scene with Luke finding out that Darth Vader is his father, which was his greatest nightmare.[83] To VanDerWerff, ""Rey\'s greatest nightmare is being no one."" She added that while Kylo Ren ""has every reason to be lying"" about this, to her mind it is a good thing that ""Rey is the child of nobody of particular importance to the story so far.""[83] Josh Spiegel of The Hollywood Reporter stated that although some fans might be disappointed by Ren\'s revelation, it ""fits in perfectly"" with the film\'s through line that one can be ""both exceptionally gifted in the Force and also not a Skywalker"" because ""the spirit of the Jedi extends ... to anyone with a gift and the power to believe.""[84] Conversely, Casey Cipriani of Bustle opined that while Ren might be right about Rey\'s parents, he is unreliable and ""we have to take what he says with a grain of salt and look elsewhere [within the story] for hints of Rey\'s lineage.""[77]\n\nBefore the release of The Rise of Skywalker, Abrams said that ""there\'s more to the story than you\'ve seen,""[85] though, according to Ridley, the facts presented in The Last Jedi would not change.[86] Rey being revealed as a Palpatine in The Rise of Skywalker received a mixed reception. Joanna Robinson of Vanity Fair interprets the twist as a rebuttal to the themes presented in Episode VIII, calling it ""a blow to those fans who eagerly devoured [Rian] Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s message that anyone from anywhere can be a Force-wielding hero.""[87] Contrarily, Ryan Britt of Fatherly writes that the revelation may be resonant for those with a ""Dark Side-inclined family,"" because Rey decides not to play Palpatine\'s ""stupid game"", and ""when Palpatine\xe2\x80\x99s face melts off and the dark side disappears into the ether, a lot of emotional family bullshit goes with it.""[88] Inverse similarly argues that the end of the film sees Rey reject ""any power her grandfather held over her"" and ""bury the past"", in a completion of the hero\'s journey.[89]\n\nFollowing the film\'s release, Daisy Ridley revealed that the identity of Rey\'s parents had been in constant flux over the course of the production of the Sequel Trilogy. According to Ridley, during the early production of the Sequel Trilogy, Lucasfilm had been ""toying with an Obi-Wan connection"" before settling on the idea of her character being no one. J.J. Abrams then pitched the idea of Emperor Palpatine being Rey\'s grandfather to Ridley at the start of production on Episode IX, although this aspect of her character ""kept changing"" over the course of filming.[90] James Hunt of Screen Rant argues that the idea of an Obi-Wan connection ""would\'ve been an equally bad decision,"" because it would still mean the character ""is powerful because of her lineage, rather than Rey simply being powerful because the Force chose her. It continues the focus on nostalgia and trying to connect everything, rather than letting Rey be wholly new.""[91]\n\nRelationships\n\nFamily tree\n\nMentorship tree\n\nReferences\n\nFootnotes\n\nCitations\n\nSources\n\nSzostak, Phil (2015).

"b'When Matt Czuchry signed on for The Good Wife pilot in 2009, his biggest TV role to date was his breakout role of Logan Huntzberger on Gilmore Girls. So it was a particularly strange turn of events that Czuchry\'s first post-Good Wife role would be\xe2\x80\xa6 Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life, Netflix\'s forthcoming four-part revival.\n\n""The universe is a crazy thing,"" Czuchry tells The Hollywood Reporter. ""In terms of that timing of putting one character down and picking another up, it couldn\'t be more special. I love the character of Logan, I love the character of Cary so to bridge that gap between them both was incredibly unique and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been more perfect timing.""\n\nCzuchry reprises his role as Logan, Rory\'s college boyfriend, in the limited series, which hits Netflix on Friday. Like the long-lasting legacy of Gilmore Girls, The Good Wife has continued to endure despite going off the air in May after seven seasons.\n\nCzuchry\'s co-stars on the legal drama, Christine Baranski and Cush Jumbo, will reprise their roles as Diane Lockhart and Lucca Quinn, respectively, for a spinoff titled The Good Fight. Like the flagship drama, The Good Fight hails from co-creators and showrunners Robert and Michelle King and will be produced by CBS Studios. Unlike The Good Wife, The Good Fight will air on CBS All Access, with the exception of the first episode, which will premiere on CBS.\n\nIn addition to Baranski and Jumbo, Sarah Steele and Gary Cole will reprise their roles from the original series. However, it sounds unlikely Czuchry will follow suit. ""No, there hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been any talks on either side about that,"" he says about a possible appearance.\n\nCary Agos might be a harder piece to fit back into the puzzle, given how things ended for him. Having grown hardened and bitter from years of infighting at the firm, Cary quit Lockhart, Agos and Lee in the fourth-to-last episode. In the finale, he appeared in a brief scene with Alicia (Julianna Margulies) and Jason (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) that showed he had segued into teaching law rather than practicing it.\n\n""I felt like the closure was actually the episode where he quit the firm and left,"" Czuchry says. ""So for me, that was his last episode.""\n\nWhen asked about his thoughts on the finale, and particularly that now famous slap between Diane and Alicia, Czuchry is mum \xe2\x80\x93 but with good reason.\n\n""I never saw the last episode,"" he says. ""Of course I read it, but that was an episode where it was all about, for me personally, being with the crew and the cast and saying goodbye. So I had watched all the episodes up until that point for research; that one I wanted to leave as just something special on set.""\n\nIt sounds like Czuchry has no intention of changing that anytime soon, saying, ""I have no plans to watch it.""\n\nIn contrast, it sounds like he will be tuning in for The Good Fight when it premieres in February. ""I\'ve emailed with Christine and Cush, and I\'m excited for them,"" he says. ""They\'re both great, so I\'m excited for both of them and want to see what it\'s going to be like.""\n\nGilmore Girls: A Year in the Life premieres Nov. 25 on Netflix.'"

"b""Who gave this the green light? A segment on a Dutch game show called Neem Je Zwemspullen Mee (Bring Your Bathing Suit) asks male contestants to guess whether women are fat or pregnant, and the internet is none too pleased about the misogynistic premise.\n\nThe shocking episode aired in the Netherlands on Sunday, April 9, and, already, many are petitioning to have the show taken off the air for good. This isn\xe2\x80\x99t the first time the series has stirred up controversy. Last year, Bring Your Bathing Suit made headlines when contestants were asked to guess whether a person was Japanese or Chinese, and if a woman\xe2\x80\x99s breasts were real.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor everyone thinking The Netherlands is great. We reached a new low yesterday night. National TV game show: \xe2\x80\x98is she pregnant or just fat?'\xe2\x80\x9d one angry viewer wrote on Twitter, while another fumed: \xe2\x80\x9cWelcome to the Netherlands, where we apparently have a tv show where men guess if a woman\xe2\x80\x99s fat or pregnant. I f\xe2\x80\x93king can\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIn response to the backlash, the series has done away with the insensitive segment, according to DutchNews.nl. \xe2\x80\x9cThe section Fat or Pregnant? was meant to show appearances can deceive. In this round we feature lots of prejudices based on what people look like,\xe2\x80\x9d show director Yvonne de Haan said in a statement. \xe2\x80\x9cIs he a criminal or a business man?, or is he Dutch or German? Putting things in a satirical setting is a way of laughing at prejudice. But we did it in a way that hurt people. That was never the intention and we regret it.\xe2\x80\x9d"""
"b'20-year flashback: Ellen DeGeneres came out, and paved the way for more gay TV roles\n\nRobert Bianco | USA TODAY\n\nShow Caption Hide Caption Ellen DeGeneres reflects on coming out ""I\'m Ellen and I\'m gay."" That\'s how host Ellen DeGeneres will begin a tribute to her landmark coming out episode that aired 20 years ago.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe\xe2\x80\x99ve come so far in 20 years \xe2\x80\x94 and the way Ellen DeGeneres came out helped get us here.\n\nAs her anniversary approaches, there is some danger in overstating the impact of DeGeneres\xe2\x80\x99 dual public announcement: literally on an April 14, 1997 Time cover emblazoned with the words \xe2\x80\x9cYep, I\xe2\x80\x99m Gay,\xe2\x80\x9d and figuratively two weeks later, in the April 30, 1997 ""Puppy Episode"" of her ABC sitcom Ellen. Culture and history seldom pivot on one moment alone, and almost never do so on the back of a single TV episode \xe2\x80\x94 even one watched by 36 million people.\n\nYet despite those caveats, there\xe2\x80\x99s little doubt that DeGeneres\xe2\x80\x99 decision to publicly embrace her homosexuality \xe2\x80\x94 and, with ABC\xe2\x80\x99s reluctant but eventual cooperation, to extend that embrace to her fictional character \xe2\x80\x94 was a watershed in how gay men and women are treated on TV. And over time, the lessons we learn from TV seep into real life.\n\nGranted, Ellen Morgan was not the first gay character to enter our homes through our TV sets. Viewers had already seen Billy Crystal\'s star-making performance in the 1977 sitcom Soap as the long-suffering Jodie Dallas, though he had more on-air relationships with women than with men. And more than a year before Ellen\xe2\x80\x99s coming-out declaration, NBC\'s Friends had aired ""The One with the Lesbian Wedding"" of Susan and Carol \xe2\x80\x94 transforming a couple who had initially served as a reflected joke on Ross into people in their own right.\n\nStill, for the most part, gay men and women were as invisible on TV as they were in movies \xe2\x80\x94 making occasional appearances as characters whose tragic disgrace was linked to a hinted-at \xe2\x80\x9clove that dare not speak its name.\xe2\x80\x9d The most you\'d find were asexual camp twists on the traditional \xe2\x80\x9csissy\xe2\x80\x9d stereotype, such as Paul Lynde\xe2\x80\x99s Uncle Arthur in Bewitched, or \xe2\x80\x9cconfirmed bachelors\xe2\x80\x9d like the one Tony Randall played in the 1981 series Love, Sidney \xe2\x80\x94 a character who had been gay in the TV movie that launched the show but was neutered once it went to series.\n\nThen came Ellen, a slight sitcom that had struggled creatively for four seasons because it was stuck in a story-generating dead end: DeGeneres and ABC were not ready for the character to be a lesbian, but DeGeneres was uncomfortable playing straight. Finally, after many rumors and much buildup, Ellen Morgan came out in a two-part, late-season episode that cast Laura Dern as the woman who made Ellen realize who she was.\n\nThere was resistance: from advertisers, conservative advocacy groups, and so-called ""tolerant"" people who were fine with homosexuals as long as they didn\xe2\x80\x99t force their gay ""lifestyle"" upon them. An argument, by the way, generally made by heterosexuals who have no idea of how often they assert their own sexuality on a daily basis in the pictures on their desks, the conversations they have about their spouses or their children, and the way they interact. As well they should.\n\nMore importantly, in the fifth and final season, there was resistance from viewers, who began to wander away. Prejudice may have played some part (exacerbated by the ludicrous ""adult content"" warnings ABC slapped on the episodes), but the truth may be that a show as paper-thin as Ellen was not ready to carry the burden of a groundbreaking subject, particularly when sending a message seemed to become its only purpose.\n\nThe show disappeared, and DeGeneres\xe2\x80\x99s career took a hit, but the world did not end \xe2\x80\x94 for her, for ABC or for Hollywood. And because the world and the business went on, others were able to step forward, through shows as varied as Will & Grace, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Queer as Folk, Six Feet Under, Brothers and Sisters, True Blood, Glee, Modern Family and Sunday\'s American Gods \xe2\x80\x94 a Starz soft-core fantasy that takes us way past those first-step Will & Grace days when characters could be homosexual as long as no sex was involved.\n\nIn essence, it\'s a progression every minority knows. You\xe2\x80\x99re not seen at all, or you\xe2\x80\x99re so disguised, it\xe2\x80\x99s as good as not being seen. Then you\xe2\x80\x99re only seen at your perceived worst, as murderers, suicides, sex fiends, and other figures of tragedy. Slowly, progress comes \xe2\x80\x94 though that usually means, at first anyway, that you\'re only seen at what society thinks of as your best, or your safest.\n\nThe hope for all is that one day, you\'ll be accorded the same rights as the majority: To be seen as who you are, in full, and treated as well or as badly as everyone else. Which means for every wonderful, romantic love story like London Spy, you have to accept a sex-fest reality mess like Thursday\'s Fire Island, on Logo. Because that\'s the cost and reward of freedom.\n\nAnd at least in part, we have Ellen \xe2\x80\x94 and Ellen \xe2\x80\x94 to thank.'"

"b'No white flag here.

"b'Showrunning director and executive producer Mimi Leder breaks down what changed between seasons of ""The Leftovers.""\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMimi Leder can direct the shit out of anything.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s Justin Theroux describing his showrunning director on \xe2\x80\x9cThe Leftovers,\xe2\x80\x9d but it\xe2\x80\x99s also as close as an opinion can come to being factual \xe2\x80\x94 and one supported by this critic. A helmer of giant blockbusters (like \xe2\x80\x9cDeep Impact\xe2\x80\x9d) and intimate dramas (like \xe2\x80\x9cThe West Wing\xe2\x80\x9d), Leder expertly transformed Damon Lindelof\xe2\x80\x99s wild words \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cHe has a lot of huevos,\xe2\x80\x9d Leder said \xe2\x80\x94 into a unique vision that brought them to life like no one else could. And she did it with incredible insight into everything from what makes each character tick to what the audience needed to see in order to access those characters.\n\nSpeaking to Indiewire shortly before starting production on Season 3, Leder dug into how the series developed over its first two seasons, what she brought to the table as a director and why one big scene didn\xe2\x80\x99t make the cut for the brilliant \xe2\x80\x94 and nearly feature-length \xe2\x80\x94 finale.\n\nREAD MORE: \xe2\x80\x98The Leftovers\xe2\x80\x99: An Oral History of the Finale\xe2\x80\x99s Karaoke Scene, from Damon Lindelof & Justin Theroux\n\nYou came onboard \xe2\x80\x9cThe Leftovers\xe2\x80\x9d as a director and then you moved into the role of co-EP, correct?\n\nDamon asked me to come direct an episode, and I directed \xe2\x80\x9cGladys\xe2\x80\x9d how I thought the show should be. It was a brand new show, so \xe2\x80\x94 when I came on \xe2\x80\x94 I felt very close to it. I felt like I somehow understood it on a much deeper level. Then, while I was editing it, they asked me to stay. There were some growing pains in the beginnings of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Leftovers.\xe2\x80\x9d That\xe2\x80\x99s no secret.\n\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s been a lot of talk about what changed and what didn\xe2\x80\x99t change between Season 1 and Season 2.\n\nMy perspective is that Damon and Tom Perrotta were really discovering what the show was about. You write a story and then your story starts to speak to you, and I believe that they had some growing pains in the beginning. \xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s point of view is this?\xe2\x80\x9d They started doing point of view stories, which they discovered were very successful \xe2\x80\x94 which it always is because it\xe2\x80\x99s from your character\xe2\x80\x99s point of view. You immediately, as an audience, get sucked in.\n\n\n\nI think that these point of views became stronger. The visual language \xe2\x80\x94 that maybe I brought to it, especially in the second season \xe2\x80\x94 helped to define what that was. The first season was very muted, very claustrophobic. And in the second season, we were moving to Austin, Texas, to this little town called Miracle. And I thought it was really important to expand the color palette, to find rich, deep colors to help express our characters\xe2\x80\x99 emotions. I also thought opening up the show visually was important: wider shots, showing the environment more because the environment was very pertinent to the story. So, that\xe2\x80\x99s what I think I helped bring to the show.\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s those details that elevate things in such a big way, but it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to just point to it and say, \xe2\x80\x9cWell hey, this is what really helped it evolve.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nYou know, it ultimately is a show about family and what it\xe2\x80\x99s like to lose your family \xe2\x80\x94 to lose everything in your life that is special to you. And so, how do you visually explore that? How do you dive deep into someone\xe2\x80\x99s soul? We use close-ups very regularly. We get in there, but we also drop back to see the body language. For me, it\xe2\x80\x99s really important to really dig deep into a character\xe2\x80\x99s heart and try and find what\xe2\x80\x99s between those lines. What are those moments when the actor isn\xe2\x80\x99t speaking? What are those moments that help express and take you to the next level? It\xe2\x80\x99s a real privilege to work on this show because of Damon\xe2\x80\x99s writing, and his team of writers are an extraordinary group of thinkers who attach meaning to everything. I am on the continual search for the right look, the right light, the right environment to express that.\n\nDirecting the Season 2 premiere, did you feel it was important for you to be the one to set that tone when you\xe2\x80\x99re starting over, in a way, for Season 2?\n\nOh, absolutely. I mean, I started to open up the show at the end of the first season. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want it to look like a whole new show. I just wanted it to breathe more, and I think we did that. We had the camera breathe more. We did bigger and bolder things. The most successful shots are ones that you feel and not ones that you are watching. It\xe2\x80\x99s better when you just feel them, and they speak to you.\n\nWhen you were getting ready to shoot or when you were on set shooting \xe2\x80\x9cI Live Here Now,\xe2\x80\x9d the Season 2 finale, were you at all considering that this could be the series finale? That this could be the end?\n\nYou know, I personally did not think it would be the end, but if it was the end, I felt it was very satisfactory in terms of a man\xe2\x80\x99s journey \xe2\x80\x94 Kevin\xe2\x80\x99s journey home to his family. And it certainly could\xe2\x80\x99ve been the end, but I never felt like it was resolved. Personally, I felt there were so many great moments in the finale \xe2\x80\x94 I\xe2\x80\x99m sounding egotistical, I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to \xe2\x80\x94 and so many heartbreaking moments.\n\nThat one scene, for example, when Kevin is in the infirmary and John Murphy comes in and finds him and he looks at him and he goes, \xe2\x80\x9cI killed you.\xe2\x80\x9d And he goes, \xe2\x80\x9cNope.\xe2\x80\x9d That scene, to me, was so much about how we live and get through life. Oftentimes, we never know what\xe2\x80\x99s happening. We just don\xe2\x80\x99t know how we\xe2\x80\x99re going to get through life\xe2\x80\x99s challenges.\n\n\n\nThe finale is just packed full of vital scenes. There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing extraneous. There\xe2\x80\x99s no fat on it whatsoever. And yet, it\xe2\x80\x99s almost feature length. It\xe2\x80\x99s about 73 minutes long.\n\nAnd I shot it in 13 days.\n\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s crazy.\n\nIt was so challenging, but we were so organized and so in tune with each other. Just that bridge sequence \xe2\x80\x94 the charging of the bridge was obviously emotional, but it was a physically difficult scene to do. That was one of the most heartbreaking scenes to film with hundreds of extras around you, but was that really what is was about? The scene was about Nora saving her baby\xe2\x80\x99s life and holding onto the only thing that felt real to her. So, the scenes for me are always about what the characters are feeling and what they\xe2\x80\x99re expressing.\n\nDid you have to cut anything from the finale?\n\nThere was one scene we cut, but I knew we were going to cut it before I even shot the scene. [laughs] I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if I\xe2\x80\x99m supposed to tell you these things.\n\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll make sure HBO is cool with it. [They are.]\n\nAfter that scene in the infirmary, Kevin and John come out and we had a scene where people had tied the pillar to a truck and were trying to pull it down. And so basically, it was John and Kevin saving the pillar-man from fighting those guys \xe2\x80\x94 kind of saving him together.\n\nEmotionally, it just didn\xe2\x80\x99t feel right. I knew it on the page. They need to go from the infirmary to walking up the street [as they do at the end of the episode]. And that\xe2\x80\x99s how I presented it. I mean, I shot the scene, but I presented my cut to Damon without the fight scene in it. He saw the fight scene and he agreed. But rarely does that happen. We do not do reshoots. We never did a reshoot on this second season, and not much is ever cut.\n\nAnd you know, by the way, when we\xe2\x80\x99re filming, we are crying! We are so into it. I look next to me, to my director of photography, Michael Grady \xe2\x80\x94 who\xe2\x80\x99s this beautiful big burly guy, tough as can be \xe2\x80\x94 and he has tears coming out of his eyes. It\xe2\x80\x99s the most gratifying show to work on because it\xe2\x80\x99s really about something. It really is about something that matters. It\xe2\x80\x99s been a privilege to be a part of it.\n\n[Editor\xe2\x80\x99s Note: Indiewire\xe2\x80\x99s Consider This campaign is an ongoing series meant to raise awareness for Emmy contenders our editorial staff and readership find compelling, fascinating and deserving.

"b'When Total Divas premieres tomorrow for Season 7, Natalya will once again allow the WWE Universe behind the scenes. And that\xe2\x80\x99s a bigger deal than you might think; The Queen of Harts has been a cast member on the E! reality show since its very first episode \xe2\x80\x94 one of only three Superstars to claim that honor \xe2\x80\x94 and the upcoming slate of episodes will showcase her run to the SmackDown Women\xe2\x80\x99s Championship and the first-ever Women\xe2\x80\x99s Money in the Bank Ladder Match. Natalya spoke with WWE about the season, dealing with Lana and the ever-increasing wealth of her cat.\n\nWWE.COM: Congratulations on the new season. How does it feel?\n\nNATALYA: Oh, thanks very much! It\xe2\x80\x99s incredible to be going into our seventh season, and by the time the season finale happens, I\xe2\x80\x99ll have been in 100 episodes of Total Divas. Which, to me, is crazy to think we\xe2\x80\x99ve had the WWE Universe on this journey with us for 100 episodes, but it\xe2\x80\x99s also a huge honor.\n\nWWE.COM: You are one of the few Superstars who has been on the show the entire time without leaving for a season and coming back. How does it feel to be one of the veterans of the show?\n\nTo be able to showcase [my] journey from Season 1 and have it finally reach fruition on Season 7 has been a dream come true. - Natalya\n\nNATALYA: I think it\xe2\x80\x99s been, for me, a journey, to be on this show since day one. It\xe2\x80\x99s so cool that I\xe2\x80\x99ve been able to allow the audience to be on that journey with me, that roller coaster of life. And we\xe2\x80\x99ve never, ever let cameras behind the scenes before like this. We\xe2\x80\x99ve never done a reality show like this before. So, to be able to share with the world what it is that we do, what makes us laugh, what makes us cry, what drives us nuts, what gets on our nerves \xe2\x80\x93 being able to share that sisterhood with the girls is most important. My life in and out of the ring isn\xe2\x80\x99t the five minutes you see me on SmackDown or Raw or WWE programming. There\xe2\x80\x99s so much more. To get to work is a struggle sometimes. It\xe2\x80\x99s planes, trains and automobiles; [the week of] Hurricane Irma we almost didn\xe2\x80\x99t make it to SmackDown LIVE.\n\nTotal Divas allows us to document these journeys in and out of the ring and show you go through the heartaches and heartbreaks of life and the moments we come together like sisters. There are girls I love, but drive me crazy in the same breath. Like Lana. She\xe2\x80\x99s really somebody that I\xe2\x80\x99ve built a friendship with, but she\xe2\x80\x99s like a sister. We have moments where we fight. I just came back from a tour of China with her, and in the same breath of me hugging her, I was ready to bodyslam her. And not in the ring. So, it\xe2\x80\x99s really, really special. I\xe2\x80\x99ve never once taken the show for granted, and to be on the show since the very beginning, I feel so honored that the WWE Universe and the upper brass and everybody that I work with can see me as somebody that people want to watch.\n\nWWE.COM: Alexa Bliss, Carmella and Nia Jax are joining the show this season. What was it like welcoming them into this weird little corner of the WWE world you occupy?\n\nYou see us on TV, and you think something of us, and then we bring you back down to earth, open up and show you we\xe2\x80\x99re really just like everyone else. - Natalya\n\nNATALYA: When I look at my favorite TV shows \xe2\x80\x94 for example, \xe2\x80\x9cSeinfeld\xe2\x80\x9d is one of my all-time favorite TV shows \xe2\x80\x93 I love watching George, Elaine, Kramer and Jerry. They feel like friends to me. I feel like myself, Naomi and The Bella Twins are all old friends because we\xe2\x80\x99re from the very, very beginning of the show. But I also love it when we get new cast members on because I think it really spices things up. It really adds to the flavor and keeps things moving and new. You love your friends, but you also love seeing and meeting new girls. Alexa, Nia and Carmella are girls I love, and I enjoy working with all of them. I respect those three girls very, very much. They\xe2\x80\x99re great partners and opponents in the ring, but they\xe2\x80\x99re also human. So, in real life, it\xe2\x80\x99s great to showcase our friendship behind the scenes and how we interact with each other. It\xe2\x80\x99s refreshing to have new blood. And Nia has a larger than life personality, and Alexa is so much more than what we see in the ring. She plays this mean girl on TV, but she\xe2\x80\x99s so real and relatable in real life. She\xe2\x80\x99s somebody that I just enjoy being around. And Carmella is one of my best friends on SmackDown. I\xe2\x80\x99ve really become friends with her over the last year. I love hanging out with her and spending time with her. She\xe2\x80\x99s become one of my close friends.\n\nWWE.COM: This season will also show your path to the SmackDown Women\xe2\x80\x99s Championship. What was it like having the cameras rolling as you reached that goal?\n\nSince Day One of Total Divas, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been documenting this journey of me trying to win the championship. And a lot of people thought it would never happen. - Natalya\n\nNATALYA: It\xe2\x80\x99s such a crazy feeling that I got to reach my dream of becoming the Women\xe2\x80\x99s Champion. Since Day One of Total Divas, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been documenting this journey of me trying to win the championship. And a lot of people thought it would never happen, even some of my own co-workers. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve never gonna get it, it\xe2\x80\x99s not your time.\xe2\x80\x9d For me, I always felt in my heart it would happen, but I had to keep going, I had to persevere and not give up. And to be able to showcase that journey from Season 1 and have it finally reach fruition on Season 7 has been a dream come true. It\xe2\x80\x99s a really great example for people \xe2\x80\x94 for women, especially, who watch the show, that when you have a dream, it\xe2\x80\x99s important not to give up on it. There were so many times I wanted to throw in the towel and be like, \xe2\x80\x9cMaybe this isn\xe2\x80\x99t for me anymore; maybe I don\xe2\x80\x99t belong here anymore; maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s not my time anymore; maybe my time has passed.\xe2\x80\x9d And that is just so very wrong now because I can truly say that within WWE, if I had said my time has passed, I never would have made history this past year the way I did.\n\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s so many incredible things I\xe2\x80\x99ve done in WWE. I was part of the first-ever Women\xe2\x80\x99s Tables Match in WWE. I was part of the first-ever Women\xe2\x80\x99s Ladder Match in WWE. At Hell in a Cell, I surpassed Trish Stratus\xe2\x80\x99 record of having the most pay-per-view matches of any woman in the history of WWE. I\xe2\x80\x99ve done all these monumental things, but the one thing I wanted to do was win the Women\xe2\x80\x99s Championship. And now I get to share that joy on Total Divas. It\xe2\x80\x99s the fairy-tale ending I dreamed of, and I\xe2\x80\x99m so happy everybody gets to watch it.\n\nWWE.COM: This also appears to be the first season in a while where nobody\xe2\x80\x99s getting married. Does that make it more or less stressful knowing you won\xe2\x80\x99t have to travel to an exotic location for a ceremony this time around?\n\nNATALYA: Well, Lana took a lot out of all of us with that Bulgarian wedding. She had two weddings, so that was enough for a couple of seasons. Had a couple temper tantrums as well. [Laughs] I had to talk Lana off a couple ledges, but we made it through. It\xe2\x80\x99s funny, because Lana\xe2\x80\x99s actually become a close friend of mine, but that\xe2\x80\x99s part of why I love her. She\xe2\x80\x99s not afraid to have a temper tantrum and then apologize after. It\xe2\x80\x99s part of what makes her Lana. And relatable. But there\xe2\x80\x99ll be other things [we\xe2\x80\x99ll see on this season.] We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen weddings on every season, and that\xe2\x80\x99s great because that\xe2\x80\x99s really what happened. I really got married. Some people were like, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, she just did that for the reality show.\xe2\x80\x9d No! I really got married. It was a real thing! I have a real marriage certificate. I really did that.\n\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve never once taken the show for granted, and to be on the show since the very beginning, I feel so honored. - Natalya\n\nIf you watch Total Divas, even though we\xe2\x80\x99re on TV every week, we all seem larger than life. You see Alexa winning championships and Nikki being featured on \xe2\x80\x9cDancing with the Stars,\xe2\x80\x9d Maryse announcing her pregnancy and Lana jumping into new roles of not managing Rusev anymore but stepping into the ring. You see Carmella winning Money in the Bank and all these different things all of us girls are doing. But what I love the most about this show is that people can watch us and go, \xe2\x80\x9cthey\xe2\x80\x99re just like us!\xe2\x80\x9d They have the same fears, the same hopes, the same dreams, the same insecurities. We\xe2\x80\x99re all human, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s great about the show. You see us on TV, and you think something of us, and then we bring you back down to earth, open up and show you we\xe2\x80\x99re really just like everyone else.\n\nWWE.COM: Last but not least, will we be seeing anymore of the iconic 2Pawz this year?\n\nNATALYA: Oh, you will definitely get to see more of the iconic 2Pawz. I\xe2\x80\x99ve made sure to talk to Peyton Royce and Billie Kay about the word \xe2\x80\x9ciconic,\xe2\x80\x9d and they\xe2\x80\x99re more than happy to lend it to me in talking about 2Pawz. Let me just tell you this: He\xe2\x80\x99s as rich and famous as he\xe2\x80\x99s ever been, and it\xe2\x80\x99s only going to get better from here. He\xe2\x80\x99s getting ready to drop a rap album, drop a perfume line, and he\xe2\x80\x99s got a fleet of Pawzerattis in our garage ready to rock and roll for all the beautiful women that are lined up to have dates with him.

"b'Tuesday, April 11, 2017 by\n\nThe basic act of curling hair is pretty simple \xe2\x80\x93 it\xe2\x80\x99s not hard to wrap hair around a curling iron or up into hot rollers. It\xe2\x80\x99s what you do with those curls afterwards that becomes difficult. Molding spirals of hair into the look you want, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s casual waves, spunky beach waves, or big, loose curls can feel totally overwhelming. I can give myself curls pretty easily, but personally, I really struggle with the whole voluminous curly hair look. I can\xe2\x80\x99t seem to get the volume required, and I also can\xe2\x80\x99t seem to manage to make my curls loose enough. It\xe2\x80\x99s a serious hair struggle.\n\nUnfortunately, big, loose curls are also my favorite type of curls. Long, cascading hair (like Victoria\xe2\x80\x99s Secret waves, as the look is commonly known) has always been my preferred style. I love how glamorous yet simple they look, and I love that they can make anything you\xe2\x80\x99re wearing seem just a little more chic. But, like I said, these curls are not as effortless as they seem \xe2\x80\x93 they require time and, yes, effort. The good news? It\xe2\x80\x99s definitely not impossible to figure out the formula. The below tutorials for big, loose curls are easy, and can be done by even the most basic of beginners. I promise! Check \xe2\x80\x99em out for your new signature style, or for something more fancy. Whatever it is, you won\xe2\x80\x99t be disappointed!\n\n1. Use a large curling iron or wand to create larger curls.\n\nSource\n\nA large wand, like 1.5 to 2 inches, will automatically create larger curls (unless you have short hair, in which case, it won\xe2\x80\x99t really do anything but create a wave). The smaller the wand, the tighter the curl, so start off with the right tools to make things easier.\n\n2. If your hair is naturally wavy, try doing heatless curls.\n\nSource\n\nWrapping your damp hair around something, like a rolled up shirt, then sleeping on it, will create curls and tons of volume (especially this high on your head). Wrap larger sections of hair to ensure larger curls; again, smaller wraps of hair will create tighter, smaller curls. This works best if your hair is naturally wavy \xe2\x80\x93 if it\xe2\x80\x99s naturally stick straight, it will only create a kink or a wave.\n\n3. Roll your hair into rollers on top of your head.\n\nSource\n\nHair rollers can be difficult to get down, but they definitely give a ton of volume. Roll hair into the rollers directly on top of your head for a big look.\n\n4. For something fast, put your hair in a ponytail, then curl the hair in the ponytail.\n\nSource\n\nTo create fast curls, first put your hair into a high ponytail. This makes it a lot easier to manage and also creates some lift because it keeps you from curling too close to the roots. Curling close to the roots means the curls usually won\xe2\x80\x99t be as large and loose.\n\n5. Gently brush out your curls.\n\nSource\n\nIf you have a smaller wand, or your hair holds onto a curl very tightly (like mine), gently brush your curls out when you\xe2\x80\x99re done.

"b'What he gave was a true eulogy, referring to notes and then, simply talking. It was a lovely ramble of a memorial. He said she was a joy to be around ""most of the time,"" that he could have never handled her as a girlfriend, that she helped find him an apartment once, that she would force him into crazy outfits and parade him around the studio lot and he would go along with it. He was generous and candid and intimate, a good mimic, a friend at the edge of his seat, recalling memories for a couple of thousand confidants.'"
"b'This article is about the baseball player. For others of the same name, see Alex Rodriguez (disambiguation)\n\nAlexander Enmanuel Rodriguez (born July 27, 1975), nicknamed ""A-Rod"", is an American former professional baseball shortstop and third baseman who played 22 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB), as well as a businessman and philanthropist. He earned a total of $441.3 million over his MLB career, the most in the history of baseball.[1] He played seven seasons with Seattle Mariners, three seasons with the Texas Rangers, and 12 seasons with the New York Yankees. Rodriguez is the chairman and CEO of A-Rod Corp as well as the chairman of Presidente beer.[2][3]\n\nRodriguez began his professional career as one of the sport\'s most highly touted prospects, and is considered to be one of the greatest baseball players of all time.[4][5][6] Rodriguez amassed a .295 batting average, over 600 home runs (696), over 2,000 runs batted in (RBI), over 2,000 runs scored, over 3,000 hits, and over 300 stolen bases, the only player in MLB history to achieve all of those feats. He was also a 14-time All-Star, winning three American League (AL) Most Valuable Player (MVP) Awards, 10 Silver Slugger Awards, and two Gold Glove Awards. Rodr\xc3\xadguez is also the career record holder for grand slams with 25. He signed two of the most lucrative sports contracts in baseball. In addition to his accomplishments, he also led a controversial career due to some of his behaviors, including the use of performance-enhancing drugs.[7][8]\n\nThe Mariners selected Rodriguez first overall in the 1993 MLB draft, and he debuted in the major leagues the following year at the age of 18. In 1996, he became the Mariners\' starting shortstop, won the major league batting championship, and finished second in voting for the AL MVP Award. His combination of power, speed, and defense made him a cornerstone of the franchise, but he left the team via free agency after the 2000 season to join the Rangers. The 10-year, $252 million contract he signed was the richest in baseball history at the time. He played at a high level in his three years with Texas, highlighted by his first AL MVP Award win in 2003, but the team failed to make the playoffs during his tenure. Prior to the 2004 season, Rodriguez was traded to the Yankees, for whom he converted to a third baseman, because Derek Jeter was already the Yankees\' full-time shortstop. During Rodriguez\'s career with the Yankees, he was named AL MVP in 2005 and 2007. After opting out of his contract following the 2007 season, Rodriguez signed a new 10-year, $275 million deal with the Yankees, extending his record for the sport\'s most lucrative contract.[9] He became the youngest player ever to hit 500 home runs, reaching the milestone in 2007. He was part of the Yankees\' 2009 World Series championship over the Philadelphia Phillies, which was the first year of the new Yankee Stadium and Rodriguez\'s only world title. Toward the end of his career, Rodriguez was hampered by hip and knee injuries, which caused him to become exclusively a designated hitter.[10] He played his final game in professional baseball on August 12, 2016.\n\nDuring a 2007 interview with Katie Couric on 60 Minutes, Rodriguez denied using performance-enhancing drugs. In February 2009, Rodriguez admitted to having used steroids, saying he used them from 2001 to 2003 when playing for the Rangers due to ""an enormous amount of pressure"" to perform.[7][8] While recovering from a hip injury in 2013, Rodriguez made headlines by feuding with team management over his rehabilitation and for having allegedly obtained performance-enhancing drugs as part of the Biogenesis baseball scandal. In August 2013, MLB suspended him for 211 games for his involvement in the scandal, but he was allowed to play while appealing the punishment.[11] Had the original suspension been upheld, it would have been the longest non-lifetime suspension in Major League Baseball history.[12] After an arbitration hearing, the suspension was reduced to 162 games, which kept him off the field for the entire 2014 season.[13]\n\nAfter retiring as a player, Rodriguez became a media personality, serving as a broadcaster for Fox Sports 1,[14] a cast member of Shark Tank[15] and a member of the ABC News network.[16] In January 2018, ESPN announced that Rodriguez would be joining the broadcast team of Sunday Night Baseball.[17] In January 2017, CNBC announced Rodriguez would be the host of the show Back In The Game, where he would help former athletes make a comeback in their personal lives; the first episode debuted on the network in March 2018.[18]\n\nEarly life\n\nRodriguez was born in 1975 in the Washington Heights section of Manhattan to Dominican immigrants Victor and Lourdes Rodriguez.[19] He was raised alongside his two half-siblings, Joe and Suzy, from his mother\'s first marriage.[20] When he was four years old, the family moved to the Dominican Republic, then to Miami, Florida. Growing up, Rodriguez\'s favorite baseball players were Keith Hernandez, Dale Murphy, and Cal Ripken Jr., and his favorite team was the New York Mets.[21]\n\nAt the end of Alex\'s freshman year at Christopher Columbus High School in Miami, he transferred to Westminster Christian School, where he was a star shortstop on the baseball team and played quarterback on the football team.[21] In 100 games he batted .419 with 90 stolen bases. Westminster went on to win the high school national championship in his junior year. He was first team prep All-American as a senior, hitting .505 with nine home runs, 36 runs batted in (RBIs), and 35 stolen bases in 35 attempts in 33 games. He was selected as the USA Baseball Junior Player of the Year and as Gatorade\'s national baseball student-athlete of the year. In 1993, Rodriguez became the first high school player to ever try out for the United States national baseball team. He was regarded as the top prospect in the country.[22][23]\n\nRodriguez signed a letter of intent to play baseball for University of Miami and was also recruited by U of M to play quarterback for its football team. Rodriguez turned down U of M\'s baseball scholarship offer and never played college baseball, opting instead to sign with the Seattle Mariners after being selected in the first round of the 1993 amateur draft at the age of seventeen.[24]\n\nPlaying career\n\nThe Seattle Mariners selected Rodriguez with the first overall selection of the 1993 Major League Baseball draft.[24] The Mariners signed Rodriguez to a three-year contract worth $1.3 million, and a $1 million signing bonus.[25]\n\nSeattle Mariners\n\n1994\xe2\x80\x931995\n\nIn 1994, Rodriguez made his professional baseball debut as a minor league player with the Appleton Foxes of the Class A Midwest League.[26] He was promoted to the Jacksonville Suns of the Class AA Southern League. He played in 17 games for Jacksonville, and was promoted to the major leagues.[27] On July 8, 1994, Rodriguez was 18 years old when he debuted in the major leagues as a starting shortstop.[28] He was just the third 18-year-old major league shortstop since 1900.[29] He was also the first 18-year-old major league player in 10 years, and the youngest position player in Seattle history.[citation needed] Rodriguez recorded his first major league hit when he singled off of Sergio Valdez on July 9 at Fenway Park.[30] Rodriguez played in 17 games for the Mariners, compiling a .204 batting average, two RBIs, and three stolen bases. The Mariners optioned Rodriguez to the Calgary Cannons of the Class AAA Pacific Coast League (PCL) in August.[31][32] In 32 games for Calgary, he had 37 hits in 119 at-bats for a .311 batting average. He also compiled six home runs and 21 RBIs.[33]\n\nRodriguez split most of the 1995 season between the Mariners and the Tacoma Rainiers of the PCL.[34] He connected for his first major league home run off Kansas City\'s Tom Gordon on June 12. Rodriguez permanently joined the major league roster in August and got his first taste of postseason play, albeit in just two at-bats. Again, he was the youngest player in Major League Baseball.[citation needed] During the 1995 season, Rodriguez played in 48 games, batting .232 with 5 home runs, 19 RBI, and 4 stolen bases.\n\n1996\xe2\x80\x931997\n\nThe following year, Rodriguez took over as the Mariners\' regular shortstop and led the American League (AL) with a .358 batting average, the highest for an AL right-handed batter since Joe DiMaggio hit .381 in 1939 and the 3rd highest ever for a shortstop. He also had 36 home runs with 123 RBIs.[35] At 21 years and one month, he was the 3rd youngest AL batting leader ever behind Al Kaline (20) in 1955 and Ty Cobb (20) in 1907, and the 3rd youngest player in history with 35+ homers. He was also the first major league shortstop to win a batting title since 1960, and the first in the AL since 1944. At age 20 years, 11 months, he was the youngest shortstop in All-Star Game history. He also led the AL in runs (141), total bases (379), and doubles (54) and ranked among the league leaders in base hits (2nd, 215), extra base hits (2nd, 91), multi-hit games (3rd, 65), slugging (4th, .631), RBI (8th, 123), and on-base percentage (8th, .414). Rodriguez posted the highest totals ever for a shortstop in runs, hits, doubles, extra base hits, and slugging, and tied most total bases, and established Seattle club records for average, runs, hits, doubles, and total bases, in a season that statistical analysts consider the best ever by a shortstop.[36]\n\nThe Sporting News and Associated Press selected Rodriguez as their Major League Player of the Year. He finished second to Juan Gonz\xc3\xa1lez in balloting for the AL Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award. He finished three points behind Gonz\xc3\xa1lez (290\xe2\x80\x93287), matching the second closest AL MVP voting in history.[37]\n\nIn 1997, Rodriguez batted .300 with 23 home runs and 84 RBIs. He hit for the cycle on June 5,[38] becoming the second Mariner, and at 21 years, 10 months, the fifth youngest player in history, to accomplish the feat. He was the fan\'s choice to start the All-Star Game at shortstop for the AL team, becoming the first player other than Ripken to start at shortstop in 13 years. It was the first All-Star start of his career and his second All-Star Game in two years.[39]\n\n1998\xe2\x80\x932000\n\nRodriguez rebounded in 1998, when he set the AL record for homers by a shortstop and became just the third member of the 40\xe2\x80\x9340 club, (with 42 home runs and 46 stolen bases) and one of just 3 shortstops in history to hit 40 home runs in a season. His 43.9 Power-speed number was, through at least 2008, the highest single season Power/Speed Number ever.[40] He was selected as Players Choice AL Player of the Year,[41] won his second Silver Slugger Award,[42] and finished ninth in the MVP voting.[43]\n\nIn 1999, Rodriguez had a .310 average, 42 home runs, and 111 RBIs,[28] despite missing over 30 games with an injury and playing the second half of the season at Safeco Field,[44] a considerably less hitter-friendly ballpark than the Kingdome.[45] At the time, he was the youngest-ever player to record 100 home runs and 100 stolen bases, at 23 years and 309 days of age.[46] In April 2015, Mike Trout reached the same milestone at 23 years and 253 days old.[46]\n\nRodriguez entered 2000 as the cornerstone player of the Mariners franchise,[citation needed] which had recently traded superstars Randy Johnson and Ken Griffey Jr.[47] Rodriguez put up great numbers as the team\'s remaining superstar, hitting 41 HR with 132 RBIs and a .316 batting average.[28] He set a career high for walks (100) and became the only shortstop to have 100 runs, RBI, and walks in the same season.[48] He hit well in the playoffs as well (.409 batting average and .773 slugging percentage),[28] but Seattle lost to the New York Yankees in the 2000 American League Championship Series.[49] He was selected as the Major League Player of the Year by Baseball America and finished third in the AL MVP voting.[50]\n\nTexas Rangers\n\nRodriguez became a free agent after the 2000 season. He eventually signed with the Texas Rangers, who had fallen to last place in their division in 2000. The contract was at the time the most lucrative contract in sports history: a 10-year deal worth $252 million (equivalent to $374 million in 2019). The deal was worth $63 million more than the second-richest baseball deal.[51] The contract was highly criticized, because it tied up valuable payroll space that could have been spent to improve other areas, such as pitching.[52][53] Dave McNally, one of the players who had successfully challenged the reserve clause in the 1970s to create free agency in baseball, said, ""My first thought when I saw [reports that Rodriguez had signed] was: Did Texas offer him $250 million and he wanted two more? How did they get to $252 million?""[54]\n\nIn an article written eight years later, Rodriguez said he regretted signing with the Texas Rangers and wished he had signed with the New York Mets instead, and that he had heeded the advice of his agent, Scott Boras. (See Opt out controversy).[55]\n\n2001\xe2\x80\x932002\n\nRodriguez\'s power hitting numbers improved with his move to the Texas Rangers. In his first season there, Rodriguez produced one of the top offensive seasons ever for a shortstop, leading the American League with 52 HR, 133 runs scored, and 393 total bases.[28] He became the first player since 1932 with 50 homers and 200 hits in a season, just the third shortstop to ever lead the league in homers, and was just the second AL player in the last 34 seasons (beginning 1968) to lead the league in runs, homers, and total bases; his total base figure is the most ever for a major league shortstop. His 52 homers made him the sixth youngest to ever reach 50 homers and were the highest total ever by a shortstop, surpassing Ernie Banks\' record of 47 in 1958, and also the most ever for an infielder other than a 1st baseman, breaking Phillies 3B Mike Schmidt\'s mark of 48 in 1980.[56] It was his 5th 30-homer campaign, tying Banks for most ever by a shortstop. He also tied for the league lead in extra-base hits (87) and ranked third in RBIs (135) and slugging (.622). He was also among the AL leaders in hits (4th, 201), average (7th, .318), and on-base percentage (8th, .399). He established Rangers club records for homers, runs, total bases, and hit by pitches, had the 2nd most extra-base hits, and the fourth-highest RBI total. He led the club in runs, hits, doubles (34), homers, RBI, slugging, and on-base percentage and was second in walks (75), stolen bases (18), and game-winning RBI (14) while posting career highs for homers, RBI, and total bases. Rodriguez started 161 games at shortstop and one as the DH, the only major league player to start all of his team\'s games in 2001.\n\nRodriguez followed the previous year with a major league-best 57 HR, 142 RBIs and 389 total bases in 2002,[28] becoming the first player to lead the majors in all three categories since 1984. His nine home runs in April matched a team record that was shared (through 2008) with Iv\xc3\xa1n Rodr\xc3\xadguez (2000), Carl Everett (2003), and Ian Kinsler (2007). He had the 6th-most home runs in AL history, the most since Roger Maris\' league record 61 in 1961 and the most ever for a shortstop for the 2nd straight year. He won the Babe Ruth Home Run Award for leading MLB in homers that season.[57] He also won his first Gold Glove Award, awarded for outstanding defense.\n\nHis 109 home runs in 2001\xe2\x80\x9302 are the most ever by an American League right-handed batter in consecutive seasons. However, the Rangers finished last in the AL Western division in both years. He finished second in the MVP balloting to fellow shortstop Miguel Tejada, whose 103-win Oakland Athletics won the same division.[58]\n\n2003\n\nThe 2003 season was Rodriguez\' last year with the Rangers. He led the American League in home runs, runs scored, and slugging percentage, and won his second consecutive Gold Glove Award. He also led the league in fewest at-bats per home run (12.9) and became the youngest player to hit 300 homers. He was tied with Jim Thome for the MLB lead in homers, and he won his second Babe Ruth Home Run Award.[59][60]\n\nFollowing five top-10 finishes in the AL MVP voting between 1996 and 2002, Rodriguez won his first MVP trophy. Rodriguez, a two-time runner up in the balloting by the Baseball Writers\' Association of America, joined outfielder Andre Dawson from the 1987 Chicago Cubs as the only players to play on last-place teams and win the award.[61]\n\nFollowing the 2003 season, Texas set out to part ways with Rodriguez and his expensive contract. The Rangers initially agreed to a trade with the Boston Red Sox, sending Rodriguez to Boston for Manny Ramirez, 19-year old pitching prospect Jon Lester, and cash considerations. However, the Major League Baseball Players Association vetoed the deal because it called for a voluntary reduction in salary by Rodriguez.[62] Despite the failed deal with the Red Sox, the Rangers named him team captain during that off-season.[63]\n\nNew York Yankees\n\nRodriguez took over at third base after he was traded to the Yankees in 2004.\n\nYankees third baseman Aaron Boone suffered a knee injury while playing a game of pickup basketball that sidelined him for the entire 2004 season, creating a hole at third base.[64]\n\nOn February 15, 2004, the Rangers traded Rodriguez to the New York Yankees for second baseman Alfonso Soriano and a player to be named later (Joaqu\xc3\xadn \xc3\x81rias was sent to the Rangers on March 24). The Rangers also agreed to pay $67 million of the $179 million left on Rodriguez\'s contract. Rodriguez agreed to switch positions from shortstop to third base, paving the way for the trade, because the popular Derek Jeter was already entrenched at shortstop. This was only the second time in MLB history that a reigning MVP was traded, with the first coming in 1914 when Eddie Collins was traded to the Chicago White Sox from the Philadelphia Athletics for cash considerations.[65] Rodriguez also had to switch uniform numbers; he had worn 3 his entire career, but that number is retired by the Yankees in honor of Babe Ruth. Instead, Rodriguez chose to change his number to 13, in honor of Miami Dolphins quarterback Dan Marino. A Miami native himself, Rodriguez had grown up watching Marino and also wore number 13 when he played quarterback in high school.[66]\n\n2004\n\nDuring his first season with the Yankees, Rodriguez hit .286 with 36 home runs, 106 RBIs, 112 runs scored and 28 stolen bases.[28] He became one of only three players in Major League history to compile at least 35 home runs, 100 runs and 100 RBIs in seven consecutive seasons, joining Hall of Famers Babe Ruth and Jimmie Foxx. The 112 runs marked the ninth straight season in which he scored at least 100 runs, the longest such streak in the Major Leagues since Hank Aaron did it in 13 straight seasons from 1955 to 1967, and the longest in the American League since Mickey Mantle did it also in nine straight seasons from 1953 to 1961. During the 2004 season, he also became the youngest player ever to reach the 350 HR mark and the third youngest to reach the 1,000 RBI plateau. He was elected to the 2004 American League All-Star Team, the eighth All-Star selection of his career and the first as a third baseman. On July 24, 2004, Rodriguez was hit by a pitch from Bronson Arroyo, which led to a scuffle with Boston Red Sox catcher Jason Varitek, and a bench-clearing brawl between both teams. On defense, he had the lowest range factor among non-platoon AL third basemen (2.39) in his first year at the position.[67] He finished 14th in balloting for the AL MVP Award.[68]\n\nIn the 2004 ALDS, Rodriguez was a dominant hitter against the Minnesota Twins, batting .421 and slugging .737 while delivering two key extra-inning hits. Following the series win, Rodriguez\'s first season with the Yankees culminated in a dramatic playoff series against the team he had almost ended up playing for: the Yankees\' bitter rival, the Boston Red Sox. In that series (ALCS) he equaled the single-game post-season record with five runs scored in Game 3 at Boston.\n\nOne of the most controversial plays of Rodriguez\'s career occurred late in Game 6 of the 2004 American League Championship Series. With one out and Derek Jeter on first base in the bottom of the eighth inning, Rodriguez hit a slow roller between the pitcher\'s mound and the first base line. Red Sox pitcher Bronson Arroyo fielded the ball and ran towards Rodriguez to apply a tag. As Arroyo reached towards him, Rodriguez swatted at his glove, knocking the ball loose. As the ball rolled away, Jeter scored all the way from first as Rodriguez took second on the play, which was initially ruled an error on Arroyo. However, the umpires quickly huddled, then ruled that Rodriguez was out for interference. Jeter was sent back to first base, and his run was nullified.[69] The Yankees would then lose the ALCS to the eventual World Series champion Red Sox after leading the series 3 games to none.\n\n2005\xe2\x80\x932006\n\nIn 2005, Rodriguez hit .321, leading the American League with 124 runs and 48 HR while driving in 130 runs.[28] He became the first Yankee to win the American League home run title since Reggie Jackson (41) in 1980. He also became one of only two players in Major League history to compile at least 35 home runs, 100 runs and 100 RBIs in eight consecutive seasons (Jimmie Foxx accomplished the feat in nine straight seasons from 1932 to 1940). Rodriguez established the franchise record for most home runs in a single season by a right-handed batter (broke Joe DiMaggio\'s mark of 46 in 1937). His 47 HR from the third base position are a single-season American League record. Rodriguez hit 26 home runs at Yankee Stadium in 2005, establishing the single-season club record for right-handed batters (previously held by DiMaggio in 1937 and Gary Sheffield in 2004). On June 8, at 29 years, 316 days old, he became the youngest player in MLB history to reach the 400 HR mark. 2005 also marked the tenth straight season that Rodriguez scored at least 100 runs. On defense, however, he had the lowest range factor in the league at third for the second straight season (2.62).[70]\n\nOn April 26, Rodriguez hit three home runs off Angels\' pitcher Bartolo Col\xc3\xb3n and drove in 10 runs. The 10 RBIs were the most by a Yankee since Tony Lazzeri established the franchise and American League record with 11 on May 24, 1936. Rodriguez became the 11th major leaguer to accomplish the feat.[71]\n\nRodriguez won his second AL MVP Award in three seasons, becoming the fifth player to win this award with two different teams, joining Mickey Cochrane, Jimmie Foxx, Frank Robinson and Barry Bonds. He also became the first AL player from outside the American League West to win the award since Mo Vaughn of the Boston Red Sox won in 1995. Rodriguez was also named the shortstop on the Major League Baseball Latino Legends Team in 2005.\n\nRodriguez reacting to a called strike in a game against Tampa Bay\n\nPrior to the season, Rodriguez opted to play for Team USA in the World Baseball Classic.[72]\n\nRodriguez was again an All-Star in 2006. His 2,000th hit, on July 21, 2006 \xe2\x88\x92 six days prior to his 31st birthday \xe2\x88\x92 was also his 450th home run. Rodriguez became the youngest player in baseball history to reach 450 home runs (surpassing Ken Griffey, Jr., by 267 days), and the eighth player to reach 2,000 hits before turning 31. Ty Cobb reached the mark while still 29, while Rogers Hornsby, Mel Ott, Hank Aaron, Joe Medwick, Jimmie Foxx, and Robin Yount all achieved their 2,000th hit at age 30. All seven are members of baseball\'s Hall of Fame.\n\nFor the season, Rodriguez finished fourth in the league in RBI (121), fifth in runs scored (113), eighth in home runs (35) and walks (90), and ninth in OBP (.392). He also led all AL third basemen in errors, with 24, and had the lowest fielding percentage (.937) and \xe2\x80\x93 for the third straight season \xe2\x80\x93 range factor (2.50) among them.[28] Rodriguez also became the second player in Major League history to record at least 35 home runs, 100 runs, and 100 RBIs in nine consecutive seasons, joining Foxx. It was Rodriguez\'s 11th consecutive season with more than 100 runs scored, the longest such streak in American League history since Lou Gehrig did so in 13 straight seasons (1926\xe2\x80\x9338). Despite this success, it was perceived as one of his lesser-accomplished seasons and was harshly criticized throughout the 2006 season. He has commented that 2006 was his most difficult season as a professional.[73]\n\n2007\n\nWhen Rodriguez reported to camp in 2007, he had reduced his body fat from 16% the year before to 9%. He made light of this fact during a Late Show with David Letterman sketch that was filmed during Spring training, which featured him shirtless being rubbed down with suntan lotion. He revealed to the press that he and Jeter were no longer close friends.[74] Rodriguez also reduced his high leg kick at the plate, increasing his bat speed, making him less-apt to strike out and a more dangerous hitter.[75]\n\nIn the Yankees\' fourth game of the season, Rodriguez hit two home runs against the Baltimore Orioles at Yankee Stadium, including his 14th-career grand slam to end the game. The walk-off grand slam was the third of his career, tying the major league mark for game-ending grand slams shared by Vern Stephens and Cy Williams.[76][77] Rodriguez also began the season by becoming the ninth major leaguer\xe2\x80\x94and first Yankee\xe2\x80\x94to hit six home runs in the first seven games of the season. Rodriguez also became the first Yankee to hit seven home runs in the first ten games of the season.[78]\n\nOn April 23, Rodriguez became the first player in major league history to hit 14 home runs in a span of 18 games, and also tied the MLB record for most home runs in April. His total of 34 RBIs in April was one short of Juan Gonz\xc3\xa1lez\' AL and MLB record.[citation needed] In a game against the Toronto Blue Jays on May 30, Rodriguez sparked controversy when he shouted during a routine play and an infielder let a pop fly drop, costing the Blue Jays three runs. The Yankees went on to win the game, 10\xe2\x80\x935.[79] On July 12, Rodriguez hit his 150th career home run in a Yankees uniform. This made him the first, and so far only, player in major league history to ever hit 150 home runs for three different teams.[80] He became the third player to hit at least 100 home runs for three teams, following Reggie Jackson and Darrell Evans.[81]\n\nRodriguez hit his 500th career home run against pitcher Kyle Davies of the Kansas City Royals on August 4. Rodriguez became the youngest player ever to reach 500 homers (32 years, 8 days).[82] On September 25, Rodriguez became the fifth Major League player to record a 50-home run, 150-RBI season when he hit a grand slam.[83] As of 2020, Rodriguez is the most recent player to have recorded at least 150 RBIs in one season.[84]\n\nRodriguez batting in 2007\n\nIn 2007, Rodriguez became the first player in major league history to have at least 35 home runs, 100 runs, and 100 RBIs in 10 consecutive seasons, surpassing Jimmie Foxx (9 consecutive seasons). He led the AL in home runs (54), RBIs (156), slugging percentage (.645), OPS (1.067), total bases (376), and times on base (299), and was 2nd in hit by pitch (21), extra base hits (85), and at bats per home run (10.8), 4th in on-base percentage (.422) and sacrifice flies (9), 7th in walks (95) and plate appearances (708), 8th in intentional walks (11), and 9th in games (158).[28] He led MLB in home runs and won his third Babe Ruth Home Run Award.[85]\n\nAfter the season, Rodriguez was named the AL MVP for the third time in his career, receiving 26 first-place votes out of a possible 28.[86] He also won the Silver Slugger Award for his position,[87] the Players Choice Award for Outstanding AL Player, and the Players Choice Award for Player of the Year.[citation needed]\n\nOpt-out controversy\n\nThe 2007 season marked the last year of Rodriguez\'s 10-year, $252 million contract before he opted out and became a free agent again. Rodriguez had repeatedly stated during the 2007 season that he would like to remain a Yankee for the rest of his career.[88] On October 28, 2007, Rodriguez\'s agent, Scott Boras, announced that he would not renew his contract with the Yankees citing that he ""was unsure of the future composition"" of the team. He received a slew of criticism from fans and writers alike not only for opting out, but also for not meeting with Yankee management before he did. He was further criticized for the timing of his announcement, during the eighth inning of Game Four of the World Series, as the Boston Red Sox were wrapping up their victory over the Colorado Rockies; even MLB\'s chief operating officer, Bob DuPuy, called it an attempt by Boras to ""try to put his selfish interests and that of one individual player above the overall good of the game.""[89]\n\nTeammate Mariano Rivera convinced Rodriguez to contact the New York Yankees ownership.[90] He contacted them directly, bypassing Boras (Boras also apologized for the timing of the announcement). Subsequently, Rodriguez issued a statement on his website, saying that he wished to stay with the Yankees.[91] On November 15, 2007, the New York Yankees and Rodriguez agreed on the ""basic framework"" of a 10-year, $275 million contract that would have him playing until he is 42.[92] The contract, finalized December 13, included various multimillion-dollar incentives for breaking career home run milestones.[93]\n\n2008\n\nRodriguez at bat in 2008\n\nRodriguez hit his 549th home run in a September 3, 2008, game against the Tampa Bay Rays. The opposing manager objected that the ball was foul, and for the first time in MLB history, instant replay (a process officially introduced a few days earlier) was used to review the play and uphold the umpires\' ruling.[94] He was one of only four batters in the AL to have at least 18 home runs and 18 stolen bases in both 2007 and 2008, along with Torii Hunter, Ian Kinsler, and Grady Sizemore. Rodriguez hit a home run every 14.6 at-bats in 2008, the second best ratio on the team behind Jason Giambi.[95] Rodriguez played 138 games during the 2008 season with a .302 average, 35 home runs, 103 RBI, and an AL best .573 slugging percentage.\n\nRodriguez at bat in 2008\n\nEarly 2009: Report of positive test for steroids\n\nOn February 7, 2009, Sports Illustrated reported that Rodriguez tested positive for testosterone and the anabolic steroid Primobolan in 2003.[96] Rodriguez\'s name appears on a government-sealed list of 104 major-league players (out of 1200 tested[97]) who came up positive for performance-enhancing drugs. The report was compiled as part of Major League Baseball\'s 2003 survey to see whether mandatory random drug testing program might be necessary. At the time, there was no penalty or punishment for a positive steroid test. Rodriguez did not immediately confirm the allegations, deferring at first to the players\' union.[96][98] Two days after the allegations, Rodriguez admitted to steroid use from 2001 until 2003, claiming that he ceased using such substances after spring training that year.[7][8]\n\n2009 regular season\n\nPrior to the 2009 season, Rodriguez was scheduled to represent the Dominican Republic in the 2009 World Baseball Classic, but he was forced to withdraw when an MRI revealed a cyst in his right hip. When he went to have the cyst drained, it was discovered that he was also suffering from a torn labrum in the same hip. Rodriguez opted to undergo an arthroscopic procedure with a recovery period of six to nine weeks, instead of the usual three to four months.[99] Although the procedure should have allowed him to make it through the season without any complications, he required a second, more extensive surgery in the off-season.[99]\n\nAfter missing spring training and the first month of the season, Rodriguez returned to the Yankees in a May 8 game against the Baltimore Orioles and hit a three-run home run on the first pitch of his first at-bat. The Yankees had stumbled to a 13\xe2\x80\x9315 record in Rodriguez\' absence, and his return fortified the lineup and provided much-needed protection for three-hole hitter Mark Teixeira, who was a notoriously slow starter. Rodriguez also supplied some late-game heroics. On May 16, his two-run walk-off home run in the bottom of the eleventh inning gave the Yankees a 6\xe2\x80\x934 win over the Minnesota Twins. One week later, he hit a game-tying solo home run in the bottom of the ninth off Philadelphia Phillies closer Brad Lidge in a game the Yankees would go on to win, 5\xe2\x80\x934.\n\nBy early June, the Yankees had surged to first place in the AL East. The club\'s fortunes changed later in the month, when Rodriguez fell into a slump that saw his batting average plummet as the Yankees fell to second place. On June 23, Rodriguez became the eighth active player to reach 8,000 career at-bats in the seventh inning of the Yankees and Braves game.[100] On June 25, Rodriguez belted homer 563 of his career, off Atlanta Braves starter Derek Lowe, and tying Reggie Jackson for 11th on the all-time home run list.[101] On June 26, Rodriguez surpassed Jackson for 11th on the all-time home run list, against the New York Mets in the Subway Series,[102] and against the Angels on July 11, Rodriguez passed Rafael Palmeiro for 10th place;[103] it was his 65th home run against Anaheim, the most by any active player against an opponent.\n\nOn October 4, 2009, during the final game of the season, Rodriguez hit two home runs in the sixth inning that drove in seven runs, setting an American League record for most RBI by a batter in a single inning, and giving him his 12th consecutive season, 13 overall, of reaching 30 home runs and 100 RBIs, breaking a tie with Manny Ramirez, Babe Ruth and Jimmie Foxx for the most in MLB history.[104]\n\n2009 postseason\n\nDating back to Game 4 of the 2004 AL Championship Series, Rodriguez had batted with 38 runners on base over a span of 61 postseason at-bats. He stranded every one of them, going 0-for-29 with runners on base.[105] However, in the first game of the 2009 ALDS against Minnesota, he hit two RBI singles \xe2\x88\x92 both coming with two outs. In Game 2, he hit an RBI single in the sixth, and hit a game-tying homer off closer Joe Nathan in the bottom of the ninth inning. In Game 3, he again hit a game-tying home run. In the ALCS, Rodriguez hit his third game-tying HR of the postseason in Game 2 in the bottom of the 11th against Angels closer Brian Fuentes.[106] For the series, he batted 9\xe2\x80\x9321 (.429) with three home runs and six runs batted in.\n\nThe Yankees faced the Phillies in the World Series. In Game 3, Rodriguez hit what appeared to be a double off a camera perched atop the outfield wall, but after protest by Yankee manager Joe Girardi, the play was reviewed and ruled a home run. In Game 4, Rodriguez drove in the go-ahead run with two outs in the 9th inning off closer Brad Lidge. The Yankees would go on to win the game 7\xe2\x80\x934 to take a 3-games-to-1 lead in the series. Despite a 2\xe2\x80\x934 performance with three RBI in Game 5, the Yankees lost 8\xe2\x80\x936 to force the Series to return to the Bronx for Game 6. Rodriguez was 1\xe2\x80\x932 with 2 walks and two runs scored in Game 6, as the Yankees went on to defeat the Phillies 7\xe2\x80\x933 for their 27th World Series Championship, the first of Rodriguez\'s career. Having reversed his postseason misfortunes, he was the Babe Ruth Award winner as the 2009 postseason MVP,[107] in which he batted .365 with six home runs and 18 RBI.[108]\n\n2010\xe2\x80\x932012\n\nOn August 4, 2010, on the 3-year anniversary of his 500th home run, Rodriguez became the seventh player in major league history to hit 600 home runs, hitting number 600 off Shaun Marcum of the Toronto Blue Jays, becoming the youngest player to do so at 35 years and 8 days old. On August 14, Rodriguez hit three home runs in a game against the Kansas City Royals. In the top of the 6th, he hit his first, a solo dinger to left center. In the top of the 7th, he hit his second, a two-run shot to dead center. In the top of the 9th, he hit his third, a towering two-run blast into the waterfall in Kauffman Stadium.[109] On September 6, he recorded his 100th RBI; it was the 14th year he had reached the mark, the most times of any player in baseball history. On Sep 29, he hit his 30th home run of the season, recording his major league record 13th straight year of at least 30 home runs and 100 RBIs, breaking a tie with Jimmie Foxx, who had 12 seasons.\n\nIn 2011, Rodriguez batted .295 with 13 home runs and 52 RBIs prior to the All-Star break. Despite good production, Rodriguez suffered his longest single season home run drought of his career by not hitting one in 85 at-bats. Although elected to start the game, Rodriguez opted for arthroscopic surgery on his knee to repair a torn meniscus that impacted his power, and was placed on the disabled list.[110] On top of recovery, Rodriguez was facing serious allegations that he participated in illegal, underground poker games. One of those games reportedly turned violent and cocaine was openly used. However, Rodriguez denied through a representative that he ever participated in illegal poker games. An MLB Executive has said that if Rodriguez was indeed proven guilty, he may face a suspension; MLB had warned Rodriguez in 2005 not to participate in such games.[111]\n\nRodriguez returned to the Yankees on August 21, playing third base against the Minnesota Twins, going 0-for-4. He sustained another injury with a jammed thumb while trying to make a play in that game. He returned to the Yankees on August 25, going 2-for-4 with 2 singles in a win for the Yankees over the Oakland Athletics. On August 26, Rodriguez hit his first home run since coming off the disabled list, a solo shot off Baltimore Orioles pitcher Tommy Hunter. He concluded the season with 16 home runs and 62 RBIs in 99 games, ending his major league-record streak of 13 straight seasons of 30 homers and 100 RBIs.[112]\n\nRodriguez hit his 23rd career grand slam off Atlanta Braves relief pitcher Jonny Venters on June 12, 2012, which tied Lou Gehrig for the most in MLB history.[113] In a road loss versus the Seattle Mariners on July 24, 2012, Rodriguez took a hit to the hand during an eighth inning at bat versus Seattle starting pitcher F\xc3\xa9lix Hern\xc3\xa1ndez. The injury was later described as a non-displaced fracture.[114] Rodriguez was placed on the disabled list. Earlier in the same game, Hernandez struck out Rodriguez in the sixth inning, making Rodriguez the fifth player to record 2,000 career strikeouts in MLB history.[114]\n\nDuring the 2012 postseason, Rodriguez was removed for a pinch hitter multiple times and did not start many times. He batted 3-for-25 overall, and went 0-for-18 with 12 strikeouts against right-handed pitchers.[115] He batted .111 in the 2012 ALCS.[116] The Yankees were eliminated by the Tigers in the 2012 ALCS.\n\n2013\n\nRodriguez playing for the Trenton Thunder , the Yankees\' AA affiliate, in 2013\n\nOn January 16, 2013, Rodriguez underwent arthroscopic surgery in his hip to repair a torn labrum. It was the second time in four years that he had the surgery, although the operation was more serious than before. Rodriguez began the 2013 season on the 60-day disabled list.[117]\n\nWhile rehabilitating his hip, Rodriguez was embroiled in a series of negative headlines: he became a central figure of the Biogenesis baseball scandal and MLB\'s investigation into his possible connection to performance-enhancing drugs.[118] Around the same time, Rodriguez announced on Twitter that his doctor had medically cleared him to play in games. Yankees general manager Brian Cashman, much to his dismay, soon revealed that Rodriguez\'s doctor did not have such authority to clear him.[119]\n\nRodriguez played his first rehab assignment game on July 2, 2013, with the Yankees Class-A Low affiliate, the Charleston RiverDogs.[120] He continued his rehabilitation and played for the Yankees Triple-A team, the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders on July 18.[121] Two days prior to his scheduled promotion to the major league roster, Rodriguez sustained a new injury, as an MRI later revealed a Grade 1 quad strain, delaying his return and forcing him to continue rehabilitating in the minor leagues. Rodriguez independently sought a second opinion on his quad strain on July 24 with a doctor who stated that there did not appear to be an injury; the Yankees front office expressed further dismay, claiming that he violated league rules for seeking a second opinion without the team\'s permission.[122] He completed his rehabilitation program with the Yankees\' Double-A affiliate Trenton Thunder.[123]\n\nRodriguez made his 2013 return with the Yankees on August 5, which was the same day that MLB announced he would be suspended\xe2\x80\x94pending an appeal\xe2\x80\x94 through the 2014 season for his role in the Biogenesis scandal.[124] On August 11, Rodriguez hit his first home run of the season off Detroit Tigers pitcher Justin Verlander.[125] With the home run, Rodriguez passed Stan Musial for fifth place in career RBIs.[126] Rodriguez continued to feud with the Yankees front office following his return, as his lawyers accused the team, and specifically Christopher S. Ahmad, of mishandling his hip injury in several ways; Rodriguez\'s legal team contended that the team withheld the injury from him and continued to play him in 2012, despite his condition. Yankees team president Randy Levine expressed negative comments towards Rodriguez, saying that he would ""feel happy if Rodriguez never played again"".[127] In response to the accusations, Cashman said, ""I\'m not comfortable talking to Alex about this because we feel we are in a litigious environment. Hello and goodbye, that\'s about it."" He added, ""It\'s not just Yankees\' management. He\'s putting it at the level of our trainers, our medical staff. The organization. The team.""[128]\n\nDuring a game against the Red Sox on August 18, 2013, Rodriguez was involved in key moments against Ryan Dempster. The first time he faced Dempster, Rodriguez was hit by a pitch on a 3-0 count, leading to home plate umpire Brian O\'Nora warning both benches and ejecting Girardi, while Dempster was allowed to stay in the game. Later in the top of the 6th inning, Rodriguez encountered Dempster again, hitting a 442-foot home run to straightaway center. The Yankees won 9\xe2\x80\x936, and Dempster, who hit Rodriguez before, was suspended 5 games by the league with an undisclosed fine (although he did not miss a start).\n\nOn September 20, at Yankee Stadium, Rodriguez hit his 24th career grand slam, an opposite field 654th career home run, off George Kontos of the San Francisco Giants, breaking the all-time grand slam record, formerly held by Lou Gehrig.[129] For the 2013 season, Rodriguez played in only 44 games batting .244 with 7 home runs and 19 RBI.\n\n2014: Suspension from the Biogenesis scandal\n\nRodriguez\'s suspension that was announced the previous season but delayed pending an appeal, was upheld, meaning that he would be suspended for the entirety of the 2014 regular season and postseason. He was officially found to have violated the league\'s Performance Enhancing Drugs policy, specifically through the ""use and possession of numerous forms of prohibited performance-enhancing substances, including Testosterone and human Growth Hormone, over the course of multiple years"" and ""attempting to cover-up his violations of the Program by engaging in a course of conduct intended to obstruct and frustrate the Office of the Commissioner\'s investigation.""[130] At the end of the 2014 season, general manager Brian Cashman announced that Rodriguez would no longer serve as an everyday third baseman after the team\'s signing of Chase Headley, and would instead serve as a designated hitter.[10]\n\n2015\n\nIn the off-season, during the week of January 19, 2015, it was reported that Rodriguez met with new Commissioner of Baseball Rob Manfred, resulting in a ""positive discussion, lasting 10 minutes in which Rodriguez apologized, while promising to behave in the future"".[131] On February 17, 2015, Rodriguez issued a hand-written letter of apology to ""Major League Baseball, the Yankees, the Steinbrenner family, the Players Association and you, the fans"".[132]\n\nRodriguez reported to New York Yankees\' 2015 spring training camp three days early.[133][134][135] Girardi planned to play Rodriguez at first base during spring training to assess whether he could be played there, a first for his career.[136][137]\n\nRodriguez played his first game after his suspension on opening day against the Blue Jays at Yankee Stadium. He served as the designated hitter, going 1 for 2 with a walk as the Yankees lost to the Blue Jays 1\xe2\x80\x936.[138] On April 17, his first multi-HR game \xe2\x80\x93 and third and fourth home runs \xe2\x80\x93 of the season included a blast off Nate Karns of Tampa Bay that traveled 471 feet (144 m), providing four total RBIs in a 5\xe2\x80\x934 win.[139] In a pinch-hit appearance against the Red Sox on May 1, Rodriguez hit his 660th career home run off reliever Junichi Tazawa, tying Willie Mays for fourth place on the all-time home run list.[140] On May 7, Rodriguez hit his 661st career home run off Orioles pitcher Chris Tillman for sole possession of fourth place on the all-time home run list.[141] On May 27, Rodriguez set an AL record for the most career RBI, passing Lou Gehrig, also moving him into third on the all-time list.[142]\n\nWith his 666th career home run against Bud Norris of the Orioles on June 13, Rodriguez drove in his 2,000th and 2,001st career runs. However, opinions varied on whether he was the second (Elias Sports Bureau, trailing Aaron), third (MLB, trailing Aaron and Ruth),[143] or fourth player (Baseball-Reference.com, trailing Aaron, Ruth, and Cap Anson) in MLB history to attain 2,000 RBIs.[144] Rodriguez\' next home run was also his 3,000th career hit, making him the 29th player to reach the milestone. He hit it against the Tigers\' Justin Verlander in a 7\xe2\x80\x932 win, joining Wade Boggs and Jeter \xe2\x80\x93 both former Yankees \xe2\x80\x93 as the only players to hit a home run for his 3,000th hit.[145] With his next hit on June 20, Rodriguez surpassed Roberto Clemente, the eleventh player in MLB history to have recorded 3000 hits.[146] On July 25, against the Twins in Minnesota, and two days before his 40th birthday, Rodr\xc3\xadguez became the fifth-oldest player to hit three home runs in one game.[147]\n\nIn his first 95 games of the season, Rodriguez hit 24 homers and produced an OPS of .930.[148] After being mired in a 72-at-bat slump without a home run until August 18 against the Twins, he hit his 25th home run which was also his 25th career grand slam, extending his major league record. The home run also drove in the go-ahead runs for an 8\xe2\x80\x934 Yankees win.[149]\n\nRodriguez with the Yankees in 2016\n\nFrom August 1 until the end of the season, Rodriguez appeared in 56 games, batting .191, .678 OPS, nine home runs, and struck out 59 times in 183 at-bats.[148] The first base experiment yielded two total appearances in 2015.[150] He finished with 33 home runs, 86 RBI, 131 hits, and a .252 batting average. He led the Yankees in home runs, on-base percentage, slugging percentage, on-base plus slugging, and bases-on-balls. Rodriguez reached 30+ home runs for the 15th time in his career, tying Aaron for the most 30-home-run seasons in history.[151]\n\n2016\n\nOn April 17, 2016, Rodriguez became the 19th player to make 12,000 career plate appearances. On May 4, the Yankees placed him on the 15-day disabled list due to a right hamstring strain.[152] On May 24, the Yankees sent him on a rehab assignment to the Double-A Trenton Thunder,[153] and activated him on May 26.[154] The next day, he hit his 30th career home run at Tropicana Field, which traveled an estimated 440 feet (130 m), as the Yankees defeated Tampa Bay, 4\xe2\x80\x931.[155] However, for much of the season, Rodriguez notably struggled to adequately produce, enduring prolonged slumps as his role dwindled from everyday designated hitter to pinch hitter. In July, he had two extra base hits, including his 696th career home run.[156]\n\nAt a press conference held on August 7, Rodriguez announced that he would play in his final game for the Yankees on the following Friday, August 12, against the Rays at Yankee Stadium. It was also noted that the Yankees would sign him to a new contract that would keep him in the organization through 2017 as a special instructor and advisor. In the offseason, Rodriguez would join the Yankees\' front office as a special advisor.[157] The club commemorated Rodriguez\'s final game as a Yankee, thanking him in front of a sold-out crowd for his efforts with a tribute of highlights on the stadium videoboard, a presentation of a framed number 13 jersey, and a base autographed by teammates.[158][159] This was in stark contrast to the year-long farewell tour given to his former Yankee teammate Derek Jeter. At the plate, he batted third and started as the designated hitter, going 1-for-4 with an RBI double. In the ninth inning, he was brought onto the field at third base for one batter \xe2\x88\x92 his only defensive appearance for the Yankees in 2016[160] \xe2\x88\x92 and departed the field to a ""raucous ovation"" from the fans.[158] The next day, the Yankees granted him his unconditional release.[161]\n\nRumors swirled regarding Rodriguez\'s future in baseball; the Miami Marlins were interested in signing him to play first base until his spokesman Ron Berkowitz emailed the media on August 15 and said on behalf of Rodriguez, ""I want to put all this talk to rest about Alex playing for any team this season. It\'s not happening. Like he said Friday night, he is happy and he is going to take some time to relax and hang with his family and friends.""[162] Rodriguez ended the season playing 65 games with a .200 batting average, 9 home runs and 31 RBIs.\n\nIn January 2017, Rodriguez\'s spokesman said that he would not play for any other team in the coming year, and would remain a ""special advisor"" to Yankees owner Hal Steinbrenner.[163]\n\nMedia career\n\nAlex Rodriguez became a guest judge on Shark Tank in 2017.[164] That same year, he signed a deal with ABC News network to serve as a contributor to ABC World News Tonight, Good Morning America, and Nightline.[165]\n\nFOX Sports\n\nHe is an MLB studio analyst for FOX Sports, working alongside Kevin Burkhardt, David Ortiz and Frank Thomas.[14] During his tenure as analyst, FOX Sports\xe2\x80\x99 MLB studio show won back-to-back Sports Emmy Awards for Outstanding Studio Show during the network\'s coverage of the 2016 & 2017 postseason. Rodriguez was nominated for an Emmy for Outstanding Sports Personality, Studio and Sports Event Analyst in 2019.[166]\n\n2018\xe2\x80\x932020\n\nAlex Rodriguez joined ESPN in 2018 as a Sunday Night Baseball analyst, alongside Matt Vasgersian and Buster Olney.[167]\n\nRodriguez became the host of the show Back in the Game with the first episode debuting on CNBC in March 2018. The series focuses on Rodriguez mentoring athletes and entertainers who have fallen on hard times. A four-episode series debuted in November 2019 and featured Evander Holyfield, Ryan Lochte, Brian Dunkleman and Nicole Eggert.[168]\n\nIn July 2020, it was announced that Rodriguez would be part of the judging panel for the Forbes\' Next 1000 list, a franchise which focuses on entrepreneurs from marginalized communities.[169]\n\nAdvertisements\n\nRodriguez was featured in a 2010 Pepsi Cola commercial as a truck driver in a fleet of delivery trucks simulating players in a baseball game. At the end of the commercial when he drives his vehicle to make a catch, he is told by his approving partner in the truck that he has a future in the beverage delivery business.[170]\n\nRodriguez is featured in a commercial for Guitar Hero World Tour, where he plays the guitar along with athletes Tony Hawk on drums, Kobe Bryant on vocals, and Michael Phelps on guitar. The commercial is a spoof of the scene from Risky Business where Tom Cruise is dancing to ""Old Time Rock and Roll"".[171]\n\nIn 2019, Rodriguez was featured in a Planters Super Bowl commercial, where he is watching the game and about to snack on some kale chips but Mr. Peanut drives in to stop him from eating kale and instead snack on some Peanuts.[172]\n\nIn 2020, Alex Rodriguez was featured in a Presidente beer Super Bowl commercial, showcasing the Dominican pride of the beer.[173] He appeared in the 2020 Superbowl Hard Rock ad which also featured Jennifer Lopez.[174]\n\nCriticism\n\nDue to the unsuccessful nature of the Yankees postseasons from 2004 to 2007, along with Rodriguez\'s sub-.200 batting average in the postseasons of 2005 and 2006,[28] Rodriguez drew criticism in the New York area, both from writers, such as the New York Post\'s Joel Sherman, and players, such as then-teammate, Jason Giambi.[175][176] Prior to 2009, Rodriguez had received the nickname ""The Cooler"" among some players because of the perceived tendency for teams to turn cold when he joins them and hot when he leaves.[177][178][179][180] According to Yankee manager Joe Torre\'s 2009 book, The Yankee Years, Rodriguez earned the nickname ""A-Fraud"" from teammates and particularly from clubhouse attendants who were said to resent his demands.[181] ""It was [said] in front of him"", Torre later said of the nickname. ""A lot of that stuff that went on in the clubhouse was more tongue-in-cheek, fun type stuff"", he explained.[182]\n\nMuch of the criticism regarding Rodriguez focuses on his alleged inability to produce hits in clutch situations.[183][184] In 2008, Rodriguez hit only .264 with runners in scoring position and two outs. In 95 plate appearances, he walked 20 times and was hit by three pitches, and he had only 19 hits. Of the 41 times Rodriguez struck out with two outs, 20 came with runners in scoring position.[95]\n\nBecause of the Yankees\' successful history, he was compared unfavorably to other Yankees greats who have performed exceptionally well in the postseason, such as Reggie Jackson.[185][186][187][188][189][190] However, after his performance in the 2009 postseason, Rodriguez started receiving many positive comparisons to Reggie Jackson, even being selected as ""Mr. October"" by Jackson and USA Today.[191]\n\nRodriguez answered many of the criticisms of his postseason performance by performing exceptionally well in the 2009 postseason, where he posted a .365 batting average and hit six home-runs in 52 at-bats during the Yankees\' 15 post-season games.[192]\n\nUse of performance-enhancing drugs\n\nIn July 2007, former outfielder and steroid-user Jose Canseco said that he was planning to publish another book about Major League Baseball, to follow his 2005 bestseller Juiced: Wild Times, Rampant \'Roids, Smash Hits & How Baseball Got Big. Canseco said his new book would have ""other stuff"" on Rodriguez, and called him a hypocrite.[193] At the time, Rodriguez denied accusations of steroid use.[194] In a 2007 interview with Katie Couric, Rodriguez flatly denied ever having used performance-enhancing drugs.[195]\n\nIn February 2009, Selena Roberts and David Epstein of Sports Illustrated reported that Rodriguez had tested positive for two anabolic steroids, testosterone and Primobolan, during his 2003 season playing for the Texas Rangers, the same season in which he captured his first American League Most Valuable Player award, broke 300 career home runs (hitting 47 that year),[196] and earned one of his ten Silver Slugger Awards. The information had been part of a government-sealed report detailing 104 major league players (out of 1200 players tested)[97] who tested positive for performance enhancers during a 2003 drug survey. Approved by the players themselves with the promise of anonymity,[97] the survey was conducted by Major League Baseball to see whether a mandatory drug testing program might be necessary. At the time, as the result of a collectively bargained union agreement,[97] there was no penalty or punishment for a positive test.[96][197] Because more than 5% of the samples taken from players in 2003 came back positive, mandatory testing of major league baseball players began in 2004, with penalties for violations.[98]\n\nThe 2003 test results were supposed to remain anonymous and the samples destroyed. However, a coded master list of 104 players was seized during the BALCO investigation, turning up in a 2004 federal raid on Comprehensive Drug Testing\'s facility in Long Beach, California. A month later, the physical samples were seized by federal agents raiding Quest Diagnostics in Las Vegas, Nevada.[98] The list of the 104 positive-testing players was released to the Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA) in 2004.[7] The players\' union later said that the 104 positive samples were in the process of being destroyed when they were subpoenaed by federal authorities in November 2003, making continued destruction ""improper.""[198]\n\nAlthough testosterone is available by prescription for some uses, Primobolan has no approved prescription use.[96] Also known as methenolone or metenolone enanthate, it is the same steroid that Barry Bonds is alleged to have tested positive for in 2000 and 2001.[98] A fairly weak steroid on its own, it is generally used in conjunction with other steroids.[199] The drug is generally preferred in injected rather than oral form due to its cost.[199] An official statement by Major League Baseball made shortly after Rodriguez\'s test results became public expressed ""grave concern"" without naming Rodriguez, noting that ""because the survey testing that took place in 2003 was intended to be non-disciplinary and anonymous, we can not make any comment on the accuracy of this report as it pertains to the player named.""[200]\n\nIn an interview with ESPN after the report came out, citing ""an enormous amount of pressure to perform"", Rodriguez admitted to using banned substances from 2001 to 2003.[7] ""All my years in New York have been clean"", he added, saying he has not used banned substances since last taking them following a spring training injury in 2003 while playing for the Rangers.[7][8] ""Back then, [baseball] was a different culture"", Rodriguez said. ""It was very loose. I was young, I was stupid, I was na\xc3\xafve. And I wanted to prove to everyone that I was worth being one of the greatest players of all time. I did take a banned substance. And for that, I am very sorry and deeply regretful.""[7][8] Rodriguez said he could not be sure of the name(s) of the substance(s) he had used.[7][8]\n\nRodriguez said he was never told that he was among the 104 players who tested positive, only that a tip came in August 2004 from Gene Orza of the MLBPA that he ""may or may not have"" failed his 2003 test.[7] Orza is accused by three (unnamed) MLB players of tipping Rodriguez to an upcoming drug test in September 2004. Orza and the MLBPA have denied the allegations.[201]\n\nRodriguez absolved the players\' union of any blame for leaking his positive test results, saying he alone was responsible for his mistakes.[7] Friend and former teammate Doug Glanville, while noting the outrage over Rodriguez\'s years of steroid use, berated Rodriguez\'s critics for their ""lack of outrage about how a confidential and anonymous test could be made public.""[97] No Major League player, Glanville wrote, would have participated in the 2003 survey if he had thought the results had even a chance of becoming public. ""It has everything to do with privacy. Being A-Rod should not change that fact.""[97]\n\nMLB commissioner Bud Selig briefly considered whether to punish Rodriguez for his admitted steroid use, citing the illegality of the situation, among other things. However, at the time of the testing there were no punishments for this sort of activity.[202] Additionally, his admission to three years of steroid use could be damaging to his image and legacy.[8]\n\nLater in the month, Rodriguez called a press conference in Tampa, Florida, and in the presence of many supportive Yankee teammates, answered reporters\' questions about his 2001\xe2\x80\x932003 steroid use.[195][203] Rodriguez said he and a cousin (whom he refused to name) bought an unidentified drug over-the-counter in the Dominican Republic, where it is ""known on the streets as boli or bollee.""[195][204] At Rodriguez\'s instruction, the cousin transported the drug into the United States.[205] For six months of the year, Rodriguez injected himself twice monthly with ""boli"" (a drug name unfamiliar to experts and perhaps a slang term for Primobolan or Dianabol, although the latter steroid is taken orally).[195] Rodriguez said he did not know whether he was using the drug properly or whether it was safe.[195] Although he ""certainly felt more energy"", Rodriguez said it would be ""hard to say"" whether it gave him a competitive edge.[203]\n\nRodriguez said he would become a spokesperson for the Taylor Hooton foundation, which educates young people about the dangers of steroid use.[195][203] He has since spoken at schools about the dangers of steroids.[206]\n\nOn February 28, 2010, The New York Times reported that Rodriguez received treatment from Canadian sports doctor Anthony Galea in March 2009.[207] In 2011, Galea reached a plea agreement for bringing unapproved and mislabeled drugs into the United States, including human growth hormone (HGH) and Actovegin. Galea confirmed to the Associated Press that he treated Rodriguez but said he only prescribed anti-inflammatories.[208]\n\nBiogenesis baseball scandal\n\nRodriguez reportedly received HGH from Biogenesis of America, an anti-aging clinic in Coral Gables, Florida, run by Bosch.[209] For much of the summer of 2013, it had been expected that Rodriguez would be suspended for his role in the scandal. The first definitive confirmation came on August 3, 2013, when MLB rebuffed the players\' union\'s last-minute offer to negotiate. Instead, it gave Rodriguez until the afternoon of August 4 to reach an agreement regarding a suspension or greater punishment for his role in the Biogenesis affair.[210]\n\nOn August 5, MLB suspended Rodriguez from August 8 through the end of the 2014 season for violating the league\'s PED policy. He would originally miss a total of 211 regular-season games plus any postseason games. He was one of 13 players suspended for their roles in the scandal.[211] In its official statement, MLB said that the suspension was based on Rodriguez\'s ""use and possession of numerous forms of prohibited performance-enhancing substances, including Testosterone and human Growth Hormone, over the course of multiple years"" and ""for attempting to cover-up his violations of the Program by engaging in a course of conduct intended to obstruct and frustrate the Office of the Commissioner\'s investigation.""[212] Although the standard punishment for a first offense under MLB\'s drug policy is 50 games, MLB had the option of suspending Rodriguez for longer than that under the collective bargaining agreement if it determined his actions constituted conduct detrimental to baseball.[213]\n\nAlmost immediately after the suspension was announced, Rodriguez announced that he would appeal. He was the only player to do so; the others accepted season-ending 50-game suspensions without appeal.[214] Although MLB Commissioner Bud Selig had the option of using his best-interests-of-baseball powers to remove Rodriguez from the field immediately, he chose to suspend Rodriguez under the drug agreement and not the CBA, allowing Rodriguez to continue playing while the appeal was underway. The proposed suspension would include a global lock clause, which would also prevent him from playing in other known leagues, such as Nippon Professional Baseball and the Korea Baseball Championship for example, as the leagues in those nations honor any suspensions imposed by MLB.[130] Rodriguez hired New York criminal defense lawyer Joe Tacopina.[215]\n\nA lengthy arbitration process followed, but the suspension was upheld on January 11, 2014. However, since Rodriguez was allowed to play during the appeal process, this effectively reduced the suspension to 162 games \xe2\x80\x93 the entirety of the 2014 regular-season schedule. Because Rodriguez was on the suspended list retroactive through August 31, the suspension would have included the postseason if the Yankees qualified (but did not qualify that year). He subsequently issued a statement saying he would be challenging the decision in federal court.[13] On February 7, 2014 Rodriguez announced that he was dropping his lawsuit and accepting his suspension for the 2014 season.[216] In March 2014, multiple sources reported that Rodriguez was refusing to pay the balance of his legal fees for his defense, which amounted to over $3 million.[217][218] In July 2014, Rodriguez was in fact sued by his lawyers for $380,000 in unpaid legal fees.[219][220]\n\nIn November 2014, it was revealed that back in January Rodriguez had admitted to the Drug Enforcement Administration that he had used performance-enhancing drugs.[221] This was contrary to his sentiments of 18 days earlier, when he had vehemently denied the allegations and also denied having used human growth hormones.\n\nA-Rod Corp\n\nRodriguez founded A-Rod Corp, a holding company, in 1996 and the company began making its first investments in 2003. Through the company, Rodriguez has invested in a series of companies in the technology, real estate, wellness, and entertainment industries.[222] In 2008, Alex Rodriguez founded Newport Property Construction, a real estate development firm.\n\nIn 2012, he founded Monument Capital Management which had acquired more than $700 million of real estate assets as of 2019.[223] According to Architectural Digest, the company owned over 15,000 apartments in 13 states.[224]\n\nInvestments\n\nA-Rod Corp has invested in various companies including coconut water brand Vita Coco, Wheels Up, Snapchat, and the virtual concert startup Wave.[225][226]\n\nRodriguez partnered with Mark Mastrov in 2012 to create the Energy Fitness gym chain in Mexico City.[227] Rodriguez sold a Mercedes-Benz dealership in League City, Texas to Group 1 Automotive in 2014.[228]\n\nRodriguez invested in NRG Esports alongside Shaquille O\'Neal and Jimmy Rollins in 2016.[229] In 2017, A-Rod Corp gained the rights to develop UFC-branded fitness centers across southern Florida.[230] That year, A-Rod Corp purchased a major equity stake in TruFusion, a Las Vegas-based fitness studio chain,[231] and invested in the beverage brand Dirty Lemon.[232]\n\nIn 2018, A-Rod Corp invested in Petros Pace Finance, a financier of green development.[233]\n\nIn 2019, the company invested in the co-living startup Bungalow, Acorns, and Sonder Corp.[234] That same year, Rodriguez and Jennifer Lopez partnered with telehealth company Hims and Hers to provide affordable healthcare.[235] Rodriguez also invested in Density, a technology company specializing in people counting.[236]\n\nRodriguez became the new chairman of Presidente, a Dominican beer company owned by Anheuser-Busch InBev in January 2020.[237] A-Rod Corp invested in Nova Credit, a financial technology company, in February 2020.[238]\n\nIn July 2020, it was reported that Rodriguez and Lopez were leading a group of investors bidding on the New York Mets, and had moved to the second stage of the bidding process.[239] The investors backing Rodriguez and Lopez included billionaires Mike Repole and Vincent Viola.[240]\n\nThe Corp Podcast\n\nAlex Rodriguez partnered with Barstool Sports in 2018 to co-create The Corp Podcast with Dan Katz aka Barstool Big Cat. The podcast interviews industry leaders, athletes, and entrepreneurs.[241] Season 1 featured Kobe Bryant, Gary Vaynerchuk, Barbara Corcoran, Mike Francesa, Michael Rubin and Barry Sternlicht.[242] Season 2 featured Kevin Bacon, Martha Stewart, Danica Patrick, Stephanie McMahon, Maria Bartiromo, and Howard Schultz.[241]\n\nPersonal life\n\nRodriguez takes batting practice in 2009\n\nRodriguez grew up with two half-siblings, Joe and Suzy, who were born in the Dominican Republic and are children from his mother\'s first marriage.[243] Rodriguez also has a half-brother, Victor M. Rodriguez, who was born to Alex\'s father Victor Sr. and his then-wife Pouppe Martinez in 1960.[243] The couple divorced a year later, and Victor Jr. was raised by his mother.[243] Victor Jr., who is an officer in the United States Air Force, fell out of touch with Alex for a period of 23 years, until they met at a Texas Rangers game in 2003.[243] His nephew, Joe Dunand, is a professional baseball player.[244]\n\nIn 2002, he married Cynthia Scurtis, a psychology graduate[246] he had met at a gym in Miami, Florida.[247] The couple\'s first child, Natasha Alexander, was born on November 18, 2004. On April 21, 2008, Cynthia gave birth to their second child, Ella Alexander,[248] in Miami, Florida.\n\nCynthia Rodriguez filed for divorce on July 7, 2008, citing ""emotional abandonment"" of her and their children, as well as ""extra marital [sic] affairs and other marital misconduct"" by her husband.[249][250] Rodriguez responded in court documents that the marriage was ""irretrievably broken"" but requested that allegations of his ""extramarital affairs"" be stricken from court records.[251][252] The couple reached a settlement that September.[251] In July, Madonna responded to rumors of an affair with Rodriguez by issuing a statement saying, ""I am not romantically involved in any way with Alex Rodriguez"" and has ""nothing to do with the state of his marriage"".[253]\n\nIn his free time, Rodriguez enjoys golf, as well as buying and collecting art.[254][255]\n\nAs previously mentioned, Rodriguez and Jeter\'s friendship had cooled in recent years. However as of 2011 , they have grown close again.[256]\n\nAs of 2011 , Rodriguez was represented by sports agent Dan Lozano.[257] As of 2018, he was being represented by Jon Rosen of WME/IMG.[258]\n\nAs of February 2017, he has been dating American singer and actress Jennifer Lopez.[259] In March 2019, they announced their engagement.[260] In a 2020 interview with Devin Bannerjee, Rodriguez described Lopez as ""a powerhouse"" stating ""I\'ve never met anyone who has the work ethic, the vision, the principles that Jennifer possesses. She does so many things that people call her a triple threat. I call her an octopus threat.""[261]\n\nCharity\n\nIn 2003, Rodriguez gave $3.9 million to the University of Miami to renovate its baseball stadium.[262] The new facility was renamed ""Alex Rodriguez Park at Mark Light Field"".[262] Rodriguez remains an ardent University of Miami fan.[263] Despite not having attended the school, he received the University of Miami\'s Edward T. Foote II Alumnus of Distinction Award in 2007 as an honorary alumnus.[264] Rodriguez had previously been named an ""honorary alumnus"" of the university in 2004. He is a member of the University of Miami\'s Board of Trustees.[265]\n\nAlex Rodriguez is a Miami-Dade Boys & Girls Clubs Board Member. Rodriguez and A-Rod Corp donated $1 million to Boy & Girls Clubs of Miami-Dade in 2010, building a state-of-the-art educational center for students.[266] Rodriguez donated an additional $1 million to Boys & Girls Club in conjunction with MLB.[267] In addition, Rodriguez created a scholarship program for Boys and Girls Club alumni to attend the University of Miami, sponsoring more than 25 students since inception of the program.[268] In 2017, Rodriguez and A-Rod Corp donated $500,000 to the University of Miami School of Business Administration.[269]\n\nIn October 2019, Rodriguez, along with Jennifer Lopez, donated a year\'s worth of meals from Tiller & Hatch to Tennessee elementary students.[270] In April 2020, Rodriguez and Lopez donated 20,000 prepared Tiller & Hatch meals to help hospitality workers in the Miami area who had lost their jobs during the COVID-19 pandemic.[271] He is also a member of the Paley Center for Media\'s board of trustees.[272]\n\nAwards and honors\n\nMajor league, minor league and high school awards and exhibition team selections\n\nAchievements\n\nNotes: Per Baseball-Reference.com.\n\nRecords\n\nMajor League Records Record Total Season Most home runs by a player of Hispanic descent 696 since 1994 Most home runs by a New York-born player 696 since 1994 Most career grand slams 25 since 1994 Most runs in a season (SS) 141 1996 Most extra base hits in a season (SS) 91 1996 Highest slugging percentage in a season (SS) .631 1996 Most total bases in a season (SS) 393 2001 Most home runs in a season (SS) 57 2002 Most home runs in the month of April (tied) 14 2007 Fewest games to hit 12 home runs to start a season (tied) 15 2007 Fewest games to hit 13 and 14 home runs to start a season 18 2007 Youngest ever to hit 500 home runs 32y, 8d 2007 Most home runs by a third baseman (season) 52\xe2\x80\xa0 2007 Most stolen bases in a 50-home run season 24* 2007\n\n\xe2\x80\xa0: Rodriguez hit 2 home runs as a DH in the 2007 season. *: Tied with Willie Mays\n\nAmerican League Records Record Total Season(s) Most home runs in consecutive seasons (RH) 109 2001\xe2\x80\x932002 Most home runs in the month of April 14 2007 Fewest games to hit 10 home runs to start a season 14 2007 Fewest games to hit 12 home runs to start a season 15 2007\n\nNew York Yankees Records Record Total Season(s) Most home runs in a season at home (RH) 26 2005, 2007 Most home runs in a season (RH) 54 2007 Most RBIs in a postseason 18 2009 Most home runs in a postseason 6\xe2\x80\xa0 2009\n\n\xe2\x80\xa0: Tied with Bernie Williams.\n\nSee also\n\nReferences'"

Her acting talent was evident early on and, at the urging of family friends, Janice brought her 4-year-old to meet with a talent agent. After booking several national commercials, Sweetin was cast in a guest spot on the popular series, Valerie. Her precociousness and winning smile caught the eyes of Thomas Miller and Robert Boyett, producers who were then putting together the framework of the sitcom Full House.\n\nFull House At the age of 5, Jodie Sweetin debuted as Full House\'s Stephanie Tanner, the middle sister of three.

"b'Radiohead // Photo by Philip Cosores\n\nPhotography by\xe2\x80\x8b Philip Cosores\n\nWell, they did it: Radiohead performed \xe2\x80\x9cCreep\xe2\x80\x9d at Coachella. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the first time it\xe2\x80\x99s been heard on this field \xe2\x80\x93 the band introduced it deep in their 2004 Coachella debut and Prince incorporated it in his storied 2008 set in terrific extended-shred style. But tonight\xe2\x80\x99s rendition \xe2\x80\x93 the main set closer of a 22-song set, which marked the band\xe2\x80\x99s fourth Indio appearance following stellar dual weekends in 2012 \xe2\x80\x93 was epic. When Jonny Greenwood hit the palm mute before the distortion kicked in on the first chorus, it was louder than the sound of a shotgun cocking.\n\nGood damn thing it sounded so tremendous \xe2\x80\x93 unleashing the rare live gem was the necessary cherry on top of a spectacular rally after undergoing unprecedented sound problems, the worst in Coachella headliner history.\n\nThe set began as magically as one might imagine, with bright white pistons of light swirling around the group during airy A Moon Shaped Pool kickoffs \xe2\x80\x9cDaydreaming\xe2\x80\x9d and the acoustic-led \xe2\x80\x9cDesert Island Disk\xe2\x80\x9d. But the revelry was halted when, about halfway through third song \xe2\x80\x9cFul Stop\xe2\x80\x9d, there was an abrupt buzz and pop \xe2\x80\x93 like the sound of a guitar cable coming loose but much louder \xe2\x80\x93 followed by a brief outage. That was forgivable. These things happen, and the band took it in stride (\xe2\x80\x9cFucking aliens again,\xe2\x80\x9d joked Thom Yorke). But two songs later, well into In Rainbows staple \xe2\x80\x9c15 Step\xe2\x80\x9d, the sound dropped out once again \xe2\x80\xa6 and didn\xe2\x80\x99t come back. The band played through to the end, seemingly unaware, as their fans could hear nothing.\n\nAfter a brief intermission to solve the issue, they roused heartfelt cheers by returning triumphantly with the otherworldly prog-jazz of \xe2\x80\x9cThe National Anthem\xe2\x80\x9d, and for a moment, as they launched into \xe2\x80\x9cLet Down\xe2\x80\x9d, it seemed like everything was gonna be OK. But for the first time ever (I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe I\xe2\x80\x99m typing this) that classic OK Computer fave fully lived up to its name \xe2\x80\x93 the sound kicked the bucket mid-song, and one of the biggest collective groans I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever heard at a festival rose up as the band again played through almost the entire track without realizing it was no longer blasting from the speakers.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m having audio anxiety,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed one exasperated fan. \xe2\x80\x9cI have an actual fear of the music stopping again.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nFor a moment, it appeared that what should\xe2\x80\x99ve been one of the most landmark sets of the weekend might end up a complete disaster. True, anyone who was on the fence about seeing Radiohead probably bailed at this point \xe2\x80\x93 the audience visibly thinned out by the thousands during the downtime. But over the course of the next hour or so, with all sound issues resolved, Radiohead more than made up for the pauses with a superb set crowned by \xe2\x80\x9cCreep\xe2\x80\x9d, which was followed by a standout encore of \xe2\x80\x9cYou and Whose Army?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 replete with a larger-than-life close-up of Yorke\xe2\x80\x99s eye, simultaneously the most wonderfully intimate and terribly uncomfortable sight \xe2\x80\x93 alongside the rollicking \xe2\x80\x9cBodysnatchers\xe2\x80\x9d and galvanic sing-along \xe2\x80\x9cKarma Police\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\nSound problems like these are cringe-worthy for any fest headliner, but in this case, it worked to the performers\xe2\x80\x99 advantage. The snafu provided a rare glimpse of a more humanized Radiohead \xe2\x80\x93 they\xe2\x80\x99re not as invincible as some people make them out to be, but they still proved some level of omnipotence by persevering with the asset that launched them to stardom in the first place: fucking great rock music.\n\nSetlist:\n\nDaydreaming\n\nDesert Island Disk\n\nFul Stop\n\nAirbag\n\n15 Step\n\nThe National Anthem\n\nLet Down\n\nStreet Spirit (Fade Out)\n\nBloom\n\nIdentikit\n\nEverything in Its Right Place\n\nThere There\n\nWeird Fishes/Arpeggi\n\nBurn the Witch\n\nIdioteque\n\nNude\n\nCreep\n\nEncore:\n\nYou and Whose Army?\n\nNo Surprises\n\nParanoid Android\n\nBodysnatchers\n\nKarma Police\n\nRadiohead, photo by Philip Cosores Radiohead // Photo by Philip Cosores Radiohead, photo by Philip Cosores Radiohead // Photo by Philip Cosores Radiohead // Photo by Philip Cosores Radiohead // Photo by Philip Cosores Radiohead // Photo by Philip Cosores Radiohead // Photo by Philip Cosores Radiohead // Photo by Philip Cosores Radiohead // Photo by Philip Cosores Radiohead // Photo by Philip Cosores Radiohead // Photo by Philip Cosores Radiohead // Photo by Philip Cosores Radiohead // Photo by Philip Cosores Radiohead // Photo by Philip Cosores'"

"b'When Sarah Herron went on The Bachelor in 2012, she did it for herself. What she never expected was how the experience would motivate her to help others.\n\n""I originally signed up for The Bachelor because I was so insecure with my arm that I couldn\'t date,"" she tells ET. ""I thought, as crazy it sounds, maybe if I ... go on and my story\'s out there for everyone to see, I can\'t hide from it anymore. When the show aired and I started getting messages from girls across the country who could relate, that was when I realized what an incredible opportunity I had been given.""\n\nHerron is ""limb different,"" she was born with only one fully-formed arm. The 30-year-old didn\'t win Bachelor Sean Lowe\'s heart, but she walked away from the experience with much more: the beginnings of an idea. Herron continued living in California, working and even went on Bachelor in Paradise twice before the way she could use her time on reality TV came to her in full. It was actually season two of BIP, and a terrible experience with infamous ""villain"" Chad Johnson, that helped.\n\nBachelor in Paradise Premiere: How The Show Handled Corinne Olympios, DeMario Jackson Scandal\n\n""He said some pretty offensive things that were specifically targeted at my arm, and that kind of all made it seem like, this is a better chance than ever to start an organization,"" she says.\n\nSo, SheLift was born. This month marks the nonprofit\'s first anniversary. SheLift is about using outdoor activities and mentorship to empower young women who need confidence and guidance at critical ages.\n\nOnly ET was on set for a photo shoot celebrating the anniversary. Herron enlisted fellow Bachelor Nation alumni Becca Tilley, Amanda Stanton, Ashley Iaconetti and Ali Fedotowsky, along with several women and girls who are part of SheLift, to be photographed in the organization\'s signature T-shirts. Photographer Brandon Kidd and celebrity makeup artist Emma Willis were also on hand. The shirts read, ""Maybe You Literally Can Even,"" a play off of the now-popular phrase, ""I can\'t even."" Bachelor executive producer Elan Gale actually came up with the wording.\n\nEXCLUSIVE: This \'Bachelor\' Executive Producer Wrote a Book To Change the Way You See the World\n\n""The idea is to stop saying \'I can\'t\' and start saying \'I can,\'"" Herron says. ""Especially when you\'re working with girls with limb differences and physical differences. It\'s ... a more positive outlook. Maybe you literally can climb a mountain or ride a bike, and pushing girls to try things they\'ve never done before.""\n\nHerron got support from Chris Harrison and dozens of Bachelor Nation alumni for the organization\'s first campaign, which raised over $30,000. Her goal this year is to top that, and to send SheLift girls and their mothers on a ski retreat, where they\'ll learn to ski and connect with other girls and women like them.\n\n""Sarah has taken her platform from The Bachelor and BIP and is doing something for girls who have really grown up the way she did, which is a little bit different,"" Iaconetti tells ET.

"b'It\xe2\x80\x99s that time again!\n\nHollywood\xe2\x80\x99s biggest stars like Leonardo DiCaprio, Orlando Bloom and Katy Perry descended on the California desert this weekend to kick off the first weekend for Coachella. While the event is a multi-day music festival, it is also a huge draw for the many private parties and events and, of course, PEOPLE was behind the scenes with the stars.\n\nGet push notifications with news, features and more.\n\nRead on for the best moments from the parties.\n\nThursday, April 13\n\nAlessandra Ambrosio sure knows how to get the party started! The model kicked off Coachella weekend and #REVOLVEFestival with a poolside dinner in celebration of her collection Ale by Alessandra x Revolve. Fellow Victoria\xe2\x80\x99s Secret model Sara Sampaio, as well as A$AP Ferg and many influencers celebrated the collection by her side.\n\nImage zoom Credit: Katie Jones/WWD/REX/Shutterstock\n\nGrammy-nominated singer and Coachella alum performer, Halsey, rode out to the desert bar crawl style with Three Olives Vodka. Along the way, Halsey and guests stopped at the Three Olives Thrift Shop with cocktails and shopping. The singer then surprised guests at The Saguaro in Palm Springs for the vodka brand\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cFind Otherness\xe2\x80\x9d party.\n\nFriday, April 14\n\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t put it past REVOLVE to keep the parties going into the weekend. The leading online retailer threw a House of Harlow 1960 x REVOLVE brunch hosted by the one and only Nicole Richie at #hotelREVOLVE at the Arrive Hotel in Palm Springs, followed by The Blonde Salad Pool Party hosted by blogger Chiara Ferragni with a special performance by rapper A$AP Ferg and attendees including Shay Mitchell and Olivia Culpo.\n\nImage zoom Credit: Jerod Harris/Getty\n\nBut that was just Mitchell\xe2\x80\x99s first stop of the day. The Pretty Little Liars actress made her way over to the VELOCITY BLACK x 1OAK/Up & Down Beach Club, where partygoers attending the bash snacked on Catch LA sushi and desserts, refueled with massages by Zeel and IV drips, and even had the opportunity to jet-ski in the mega-mansion\xe2\x80\x99s very own backyard lake.\n\nUpon arrival, Mitchell posed for photos with her stylists, Marie-Lou and Chloe Bartoli. Those who opted for the day club instead of the festival danced to music by will DJ Taco (of ODD Future), as they sipped on cocktails by Absolut Elyx mixed with Red Bull, D\xe2\x80\x99usse and Budweiser. The star-studded guest list included some of Hollywood\xe2\x80\x99s finest, like Tobey Maguire, Leonardo DiCaprio, Orlando Bloom, Tyga, Russell Simmons, Rita Ora, Sofia Richie, Chanel Iman and more. Amid Tyga\xe2\x80\x99s recent split from girlfriend Kylie Jenner, an onlooker tells PEOPLE the rapper \xe2\x80\x9cappeared to be in great spirits, as he sipped on a drink and partied with a table full of his male friends.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe rapper left the party with his entourage through the back entrance around 5:45 p.m., right around the same time Paris Hilton showed up hand-in-hand with Chris Zylka.\n\nWhile some were keen on showing affection, others just enjoyed the sunny California weather poolside at a private cabana with some best friends.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOrlando was really low-key at the party. He wasn\xe2\x80\x99t flirting with any girls and was just wandering around with a guy friend,\xe2\x80\x9d says an onlooker about the newly single star, whose ex Katy Perry partied at the FUNBOY X Smashbox pool party just miles away. \xe2\x80\x9cTobey hung out at a VIP table and later spent time with his BFF Leonardo DiCaprio.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nImage zoom Credit: FameFlynet\n\nAnother day, another fashion celebration. Ambrosio, along with model pals Jasmine Tookes, Josephine Skriver, Martha Hunt and Romee Strijd helped kick off the Sexy Little Things launch at the Victoria\xe2\x80\x99s Secret Angel Oasis with a poolside lunch. Meanwhile, guests enjoyed a relaxing afternoon at the desert retreat, which included everything from an ice cream truck to a live deejay to a styling suite by Hunt\xe2\x80\x99s stylist, Lindsay Grosswendt. Before the event, Skriver, Hunt and Australian actress Adelaide Kane also got a quick Tone It Up workout sesh in presented by fitness gurus Karena Dawn and Katrina Scott.\n\nImage zoom Credit: Xavier Collin/IPA/Splash News Online\n\nWell, it\xe2\x80\x99s safe to say Jenner and Tyga kept their distance at separate parties \xe2\x80\x94 so far, that is. The Keeping Up with the Kardashians star attended the Pretty Little Things x PAPER Magazine party with besties Jordyn Woods and Stassie Karanikolaou. Once they arrived they decided to forgo the first stop at the carpet, and instead headed straight to the fun, where they quickly got comfortable at their VIP table by the pool and snacked on hamburgers and french fries while mingling with friends. Continuing on with fashion parties at Coachella, Hailee Steinfeld performed at Republic Records x sbe\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cThe Hyde Away\xe2\x80\x9d Presented by Hudson. The singer-actress sang an acoustic set at the party (with mom, dad and boyfriend Cameron Smoller in the front row) and then stopped by the Hudson Jeans suite to grab festival swag.\n\nImage zoom Credit: Jonathan Leibson/Getty Images for NYLON Media\n\nFROM COINAGE: The Real Cost of Going to Coachella\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s a tough life bouncing from party to party.

Carter\xe2\x80\x99s fianc\xc3\xa9, Brody Jenner, was also in attendance as the party\xe2\x80\x99s deejay. His music was enjoyed by sisters Vanessa and Stella Hudgens. Partygoers looking for a styling session at the Musse & Cloud, boohoo.com and HerCampus-sponsored event were able to hit up the L\xe2\x80\x99Or\xc3\xa9al Paris\xe2\x80\x99 beauty bar like pals Becca Tilley and Witney Carson, who received glitter roots and braids.\n\nImage zoom Credit: Joshua Blanchard/Getty Images for NYLON Media\n\nSaturday, April 15\n\nLeave it up to Kendall and Kylie Jenner to buzz around the desert to the best parties.

Kendall arrived first to the \xe2\x80\x9cAspen Chic meets Desert Heat\xe2\x80\x9d-themed bash with best friend Hailey Baldwin in tow, while Kylie Jenner showed up a little later on with pal Jordyn Woods. And being just weeks after Kendall\xe2\x80\x99s Pepsi controversy when her advertisement was pulled for being deemed as \xe2\x80\x9ctone deaf,\xe2\x80\x9d the model still didn\xe2\x80\x99t appear to be in the best spirits. \xe2\x80\x9cKendall did not look happy,\xe2\x80\x9d a source tells PEOPLE. \xe2\x80\x9cShe was hanging out alone on a corner couch in the VIP area with Hailey Baldwin with staring at her phone.\xe2\x80\x9d And Kylie arrived just in time to get the party started. The Life of Kylie star showed up sporting her new purple hairdo in a snakeskin skirt and top set alongside Woods, as they took to the dance floor to show off some moves.\n\nNext up for Baldwin and Kendall Jenner was the Bootsy Bellow party, where the friends hung out at their poolside VIP cabana at the sprawling estate. \xe2\x80\x9cThey seemed to be partners in crime for Coachella,\xe2\x80\x9d says a source, adding that Jenner was in \xe2\x80\x9cgood spirits\xe2\x80\x9d at the event. Also enjoying the music and a performance by Lil Yachty was Katy Perry, who was overheard telling her Coachella posse that she dresses to make an entrance. The singer was also joined by fashionable friends Jeremy Scott and Mia Morretti.\n\nMeanwhile in another poolside cabana, Modern Family star Ariel Winter, with her new hot pink hairstyle, spent most of the afternoon perched on her boyfriend Levi Meaden\xe2\x80\x99s knee. Over at Sofia Richie\xe2\x80\x99s cabana, it was full party mode as her spot was overflowing with guests.

Christina Milian was laughing and chatting with friends as she made her way through the event. Tyler the Creator also popped by to watch his friend and fellow Odd Future member, DJ Taco, as he played music for partygoers. While he was there, Tyler stayed next to the stage and hung out with Kendall Jenner\xe2\x80\x99s ex love interest, Jordan Clarkson, at the bash, which featured a PacSun pop-up shop, a rock climbing wall and live performances. Not to mention guests had food options from several different trucks, including one that served delicious ice cream cookie sandwiches by Coolhaus.\n\nImage zoom Credit: Katie Jones/WWD/REX/Shutterstock\n\nMo\xc3\xabt & Chandonkicked off Coachella in style at the #REVOLVEFestival during the fashion e-tailer\xe2\x80\x99s 2nd annual star-studded bash.

Joe Jonas with band DNCE hopped on the Three Olives \xe2\x80\x9cFind Otherness\xe2\x80\x9d bus (a staple of this year\xe2\x80\x99s music festival bouncing celebrities and influencers from party to party) from their desert house in Rancho Mirage and headed to the Saguaro, Palms Springs for some fun under the sun. Once in the bus, Jonas took the role of deejay to get the party started, plugging in his phone and turning on his favorite Spotify station, \xe2\x80\x9cRap Caviar.\xe2\x80\x9d Once the crew arrived at the hotel, the crew opted to relax in their private hotel room for a bit before heading down to the secluded hammock area near the pool \xe2\x80\x93 where Jonas met up with his younger brother Nick and some other friends.

The photo booth read each guest\xe2\x80\x99s energy waves and matched them with the best ORB\xe2\x84\xa2 product for their aura like a Smooth Energy or Sleep Complex.

"b'When \xe2\x80\x9cGirls\xe2\x80\x9d premiered in April 2012, it was almost all that the TV aficionado community could talk about, and it made a giant splash in pop culture, too. Nearly everyone had a strong take on the show Lena Dunham created. Below is Part 2 of Variety\xe2\x80\x99s TV critics\xe2\x80\x99 reflections on the show\xe2\x80\x99s legacy and impact \xe2\x80\x94 and why they\xe2\x80\x99re both happy and sad that the story of Hannah Horvath and her friends is wrapping up. (Part 1, from before the finale aired, is here, and a post-finale talk with executive producers Jenni Konner and Lena Dunham is here.)\n\nSonia Saraiya: Well, that was pretty perfect. I mean, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t, but in its insular, domestic sphere, harsh reality, \xe2\x80\x9cLatching\xe2\x80\x9d is where this whole season was trending, and such a fitting counterpoint to a similarly insular but much more self-aggrandizing premiere episode of \xe2\x80\x9cGirls.\xe2\x80\x9d I appreciate that instead of being about transformation, for any of the characters, the finale emphasizes resilience \xe2\x80\x94 that problems arise, and our predictable anxieties will flare up, but you can get better at bouncing back.\n\nFurthermore \xe2\x80\x94 I have never felt fully onboard with Hannah\xe2\x80\x99s pregnancy as a plot point, and I appreciated learning that she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t fully onboard with it, either. That narrative about being a new mother sounds like it may have come from Jenni Konner, who co-wrote and directed this episode, who talks about childrearing in interviews (including in a post-finale Q&A with Variety). Glimpsing a bit of \xe2\x80\x9cGirls\xe2\x80\x9d famously raw and unflinching lens directed at child-rearing is pretty satisfying.\n\nBut really, what got me is that Tracy Chapman\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cFast Car\xe2\x80\x9d was stitched \xe2\x80\x94 thematically and melodically \xe2\x80\x94 through the episode. It\xe2\x80\x99s almost not fair, because that song is wrenching enough to do a lot of emotional heavy lifting on its own. But its circularity about running away, growing up, finding home, and being someone must feel especially relevant when you\xe2\x80\x99re a single mom in a house in the woods, just one car trip away from running away. In the premiere of \xe2\x80\x9cGirls,\xe2\x80\x9d Hannah asks her own parents for money; in the finale, she has to assume the mantle of grown-up, even though she\xe2\x80\x99s scared s\xe2\x80\x93itless, mostly because someone has to do it, and she can\xe2\x80\x99t quit now. But is this what she wanted? Is she happy? Or is her settled contentment at the end, once Grover has finally started breastfeeding, about as good as it gets in this life? \xe2\x80\x9cFast Car\xe2\x80\x9d doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have easy answers, and I liked that \xe2\x80\x9cLatching\xe2\x80\x9d doesn\xe2\x80\x99t either.\n\nMaureen Ryan: Oh \xe2\x80\x9cGirls,\xe2\x80\x9d you did the most \xe2\x80\x9cGirls\xe2\x80\x9d thing possible: After loving most of the lyrical and emotionally acute final season, I spent a good chunk of the finale wanting to scream and fending off a migraine. For me, the combative self-absorption of the characters just felt overly familiar and the setting a little too claustrophobic, and for the first two-thirds of the episode, a lot of the post-birth story played out in ways that I found frustrating rather than illuminating. I see where you\xe2\x80\x99re coming from, and the last few minutes were sweet and memorable, but in the main, I found this particular variety of \xe2\x80\x9cGirls\xe2\x80\x9d episode \xe2\x80\x94 argumentative and somewhat predictable \xe2\x80\x94 more off-putting than most. So here we are, having one more critical argument about \xe2\x80\x9cGirls\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 yay?\n\nThe thing is, many different TV shows have hauled out the difficulties of parenting a newborn to manufacture drama or conflict, so the topics on display and the treatments of them just felt overly familiar to me. And perhaps Marnie\xe2\x80\x99s oblivious self-absorption was meant to be funny, but we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen that so many times before, and given the stakes \xe2\x80\x94 i.e., the life and health of a baby \xe2\x80\x94 her condescending selfishness really grated on me throughout much of the final half-hour. This being \xe2\x80\x9cGirls,\xe2\x80\x9d perhaps her behavior was meant to annoy, but that\xe2\x80\x99s a flavor that can get old fast.\n\nIt wasn\xe2\x80\x99t until the great Becky Ann Baker showed up to school everybody that I could actually begin to find a few shreds of enjoyment in the finale. The upside is, all the yelling and crying and immaturity made me more than OK than with the fact that this show \xe2\x80\x94 which I have often loved, especially this season \xe2\x80\x94 is ending. Good luck, little Grover. (She really named her kid Grover? Hannah. You did not have to do that. Sigh.)\n\nSaraiya: How funny that you are positive about the show, but not about the finale, while I am almost vice-versa. I liked \xe2\x80\x9cLatching,\xe2\x80\x9d though I admit that I have no idea what to make of the fact that Hannah\xe2\x80\x99s son is a brown baby \xe2\x80\x94 and will grow up to be a man of color. With this show\xe2\x80\x99s relationship to racial dynamics, something about this feels strangely superficial. Of course, at this point, \xe2\x80\x9cGirls\xe2\x80\x9d is damned if it does, and damned if it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x94 but isn\xe2\x80\x99t it a bit odd that It\xe2\x80\x99s never discussed or dealt with, it\xe2\x80\x99s just, oh yeah, Hannah\xe2\x80\x99s having a brown baby? The show\xe2\x80\x99s deep-seated discomfort with engaging with race never disappeared, despite six seasons of us talking about it.\n\nIn Part 1, you wrote that you always found \xe2\x80\x9cGirls\xe2\x80\x9d to be sincere. That struck me while watching the finale and pondering this baby, because I was so often frustrated that the show wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sincere with its setups \xe2\x80\x94 there was this surreality or fantasy-level to the characters\xe2\x80\x99 lives that made them more ciphers than characters. Even in this final season, which has been one of the most grounded, I read this long piece about how Hannah\xe2\x80\x99s salaried-with-benefits teaching job at a cushy lib arts school upstate is essentially impossible. Maybe what you were saying is that the show always meant well \xe2\x80\x94 but even that, I\xe2\x80\x99m not always so sure about. I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying I\xe2\x80\x99m ascribing evil motives to the show either. But like, I think sometimes the show was going for the best joke, or the most interesting denouement, not the one it felt the most strongly about.\n\nIn its defense, though, I think \xe2\x80\x9cGirls\xe2\x80\x9d was as much about Dunham and co. making characters out of the idiosyncrasies and silliness that they themselves were experiencing in the high creative echelons of contemporary hipsterdom. Hannah the writer, Ray the failed artist, Adam the actor, Marnie the \xe2\x80\x9cmusician,\xe2\x80\x9d Shosh the publicist, Jessa from rehab \xe2\x80\x94 and on, and on. That person you know who moved upstate to have a kid on her own. That girl who got engaged two weeks after meeting someone and seems very happy. The one whose marriage fell apart and is now having some obscure experience of personal growth in another state. We don\xe2\x80\x99t have tell-all novels, a la Jay McInerney or Bret Easton Ellis, about the New York arty media scene anymore: now we have shows like \xe2\x80\x9cGirls\xe2\x80\x9d to deliver second- or thirdhand gossip.\n\nThis cements one of my long-held feelings about the show, which is that more than being aimed at millennials, it was a show about millennials for millennials\xe2\x80\x99 parents. Not you, Mo, you proud Gen X-er, but those homeowning HBO subscribers who want to ask what their kids are doing but maybe don\xe2\x80\x99t feel so comfortable asking about \xe2\x80\x9ccrack-cidents\xe2\x80\x9d on the phone. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s insignificant that this series has been as much about Becky Ann Baker\xe2\x80\x99s transformation, as Hannah\xe2\x80\x99s mom, as it has been about Hannah herself. (She was just fantastic in the finale.)\n\nRyan: I think you\xe2\x80\x99re onto something there. I once wrote a long piece about the similarities between Liz Phair and Lena Dunham (who both went to Oberlin, and who both were lionized and torn apart in equal measure for their creative exploits \xe2\x80\x94 20 years apart). We touched on this briefly in Part 1 of our dialogue, this idea of voyeurism: I would bet most HBO subscribers have never lived in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, but they want a window into that world, just like they want to know, on Sunday nights, what\xe2\x80\x99s up in the realm of dragons and Lannisters. You\xe2\x80\x99re so right about this being the Jay McInerney or Tama Janowitz novel of its time. Who has the time to read the hot new novelist\xe2\x80\x99s take on what the cool people are doing in NYC? But we can watch this show and feel at least partially informed about what the Youngs are up to.\n\nI recall that somewhat early in the show\xe2\x80\x99s run, a bunch of stories were published on the topic of how a goodly number of middle-aged male HBO subscribers watched \xe2\x80\x9cGirls.\xe2\x80\x9d Well, why wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t they? Not only would it make all those tuition-paying dads feel like they knew what was up in their kids\xe2\x80\x99 lives, \xe2\x80\x9cGirls\xe2\x80\x9d contended with the issues surrounding masculinity and intimacy that a lot of other prestige shows explore, but with a lot fewer murders and brothels.\n\nHannah grappled with a lot of things \xe2\x80\x94 her narcissism, her difficulty in sustaining jobs and relationships, her parents\xe2\x80\x99 breakup, and now, this season, an unexpected pregnancy. But I\xe2\x80\x99ve been thinking a lot about that the fact that a huge throughline of the show has concerned the reality that the men in Hannah\xe2\x80\x99s life were often both more and less than she could handle, and she was never quite sure what to do about that. (As Hannah herself notes, Grover was just the latest in a long list of males with whom she had difficulties, though he was probably also the cutest. And not to sidestep the race thing, but it\xe2\x80\x99s really strange to me that Hannah wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t address the fact that she is parenting a non-white boy. You\xe2\x80\x99d think that would be the exact sort of thing she\xe2\x80\x99d monologue about, and I can definitely see why you felt that aspect of the story felt tacked-on.)\n\nBut speaking of men in general, I think a lot of women watching could relate to the issues that Hannah and all the other women contended with when it came to the guys in their lives. Weirdly enough, there were a lot of moments in which the men felt as though they were more dimensionalized than the women \xe2\x80\x94 in a show called \xe2\x80\x9cGirls.\xe2\x80\x9d It was one more conundrum to contend with, I suppose.\n\nThat said, I don\xe2\x80\x99t feel all that cheated about who grew most or least, given that, as you say, for most of the characters on the show, they didn\xe2\x80\x99t grow a ton. As was the case with Don Draper, I think they got better at recognizing and accepting their flaws, and seeing past their own pain and self-absorption and at least attempting altruism on a regular basis (the presence of a helpless baby in your life will often force that kind of accelerated growth on a person). Over time, though they were still spectacularly myopic at times, the show undeniably got better at depicting them sometimes stepping past the landmines that they, in the past, would have embraced in a fairly unthinking way.\n\nSaraiya: This is interesting, because I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have come to this conclusion. I never felt the show was interrogating its men. Adam is a great character, and has really grown on me, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the show has ever really investigated what was behind his pent-up rage and desire to humiliate his sexual partners in the first season \xe2\x80\x94 the negging, almost, that characterized his affection for Hannah. I mean, he ended up with Jessa, who two episodes ago admitted she was a sociopath. Ray is a curmudgeon, and the show kind of embraces that; but along the way he\xe2\x80\x99s used Shoshana pretty abominably. Laird is out here still hitting on Hannah. And while Elijah is, again, played very well by Andrew Rannells, I\xe2\x80\x99m not so sure that he\xe2\x80\x99s learned or grown or anything. If \xe2\x80\x9cGirls\xe2\x80\x9d is anything, it\xe2\x80\x99s the show of barely perceptible character development.\n\nOn the other hand, though, it\xe2\x80\x99s probably significant that Hannah has not a girl baby but a boy \xe2\x80\x94 Grover, the name for the cutest boy muppet. And throughout the finale, Hannah makes these funny comments like \xe2\x80\x9cMen are disgusting!\xe2\x80\x9d for no real reason. Maybe for Dunham, \xe2\x80\x9cGirls\xe2\x80\x9d was partly an effort to redeem men. It seems she may have succeeded.\n\nRyan: You may be right \xe2\x80\x94 along with the show, I may not have investigated the motivations and actions of the male characters as much as I could have. I think that might be partly for a defensible reason \xe2\x80\x94 damn, this cast was so good. It was hard not to be forgiving (possibly too forgiving) when the characters were this unpredictable and often hilarious in their oddity and messy, fascinating humanity. Alex Karpovsky, Adam Driver, Andrew Rannells and Peter Scolari were just so fun to watch, no matter how weak or selfish or weird their characters were, and Chris O\xe2\x80\x99Dowd saying \xe2\x80\x9cThat was my Humie\xe2\x80\x9d in his epic final fight with Jessa ranks in my Top 5 \xe2\x80\x9cGirls\xe2\x80\x9d lines ever. Elijah was often the comic relief, but Rannells could turn on a dime and almost make me cry, even when he was just running lines in a department store.\n\nWould you agree that the members of the cast \xe2\x80\x94 particularly the core four women \xe2\x80\x94 have become better actors, in some cases shockingly so, since the show began? It\xe2\x80\x99s not that I think anyone was bad back in 2012, but there were moments when I wondered about the range and versatility of some of the performers. The assurance that they have now, and the wide array of emotions that they can lock into, I find, is truly remarkable. Dunham in particular has been able to work in small gestures and very subtle emotional shades this season. She\xe2\x80\x99s really been exceptional. And it didn\xe2\x80\x99t surprise me that Allison Williams was so good in \xe2\x80\x9cGet Out\xe2\x80\x9d because she\xe2\x80\x99s grown tremendously on \xe2\x80\x9cGirls\xe2\x80\x9d in the last few years. Am I wrong about that?\n\nSaraiya: Oh, absolutely. Dunham in particular has become a much stronger actress. Her scene with Jemima Kirke in the penultimate episode, \xe2\x80\x9cGoodbye Tour,\xe2\x80\x9d is striking for just how emotive both are after spending so many seasons playing robotic caricatures. I\xe2\x80\x99m inclined to think that Williams\xe2\x80\x99 performance has stayed the same, but the writers\xe2\x80\x99 sense of irony towards her has heightened (and in \xe2\x80\x9cGet Out,\xe2\x80\x9d she is entirely manufactured, which of course makes perfect sense). The show has also been characterized by performers that were already great, right from the start: Becky Ann Baker, Andrew Rannells, Adam Driver, Zosia Mamet, and Alex Karpovsky (who in some episodes stole the show from Dunham).\n\nRyan: Agreed. To wrap things up, here\xe2\x80\x99s the greatest compliment I can pay any show, and I think \xe2\x80\x9cGirls\xe2\x80\x9d certainly merits it: I know I\xe2\x80\x99ll spend time thinking about what all these men and women are up to, even though I won\xe2\x80\x99t get to check in on their lives and loves and aspirations any time soon. How will they get on? Will they find ways to support each other, even as they stumble over the bigger obstacles and frustrations life is likely to throw at them in the next couple of decades? If there is a reunion movie several years from now, I\xe2\x80\x99d eagerly watch that (and of course it\xe2\x80\x99s no sure thing that this great cast, all of whom deserve to go on to bigger and better things, will not too busy to be reassembled). What\xe2\x80\x99s great is that I honestly can\xe2\x80\x99t fully picture the trajectory of each character, though I like to imagine a future in which Ray is the mayor of New York, or at least the crankiest dad in Brooklyn.\n\nThese characters frustrated me, they entertained me, they shook up what was possible on television. They made me re-examine my assumptions and they prompted some of the best conversations I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever had about this medium that we love. Hannah Horvath, you forced me to think harder and to dig deeper, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if I fully got what \xe2\x80\x9cGirls\xe2\x80\x9d was going for all the time, but I\xe2\x80\x99m truly grateful for the provocations and the laughs and the unpredictable ride.\n\nI can easily picture Grover reminiscing about his mom 20 years from now, when he\xe2\x80\x99s sitting on the lawn of some well-regarded liberal arts college.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s a lot,\xe2\x80\x9d he\xe2\x80\x99ll probably say, \xe2\x80\x9cbut it was an adventure every day.\xe2\x80\x9d'"
"b'Dakota Meyer accused Bristol Palin of keeping him from seeing his daughter Sailor and claimed she left him a week before their wedding in a long, explosive social media post on Wednesday.\n\nThe former Marine, 30, took to Instagram in the morning to share details of his past relationship with Bristol, 27, including their first planned wedding, which they called off before the birth of their first child together.\n\nBristol and Dakota were first set to tie the knot in May 2015 in Dakota\'s home state of Kentucky, but that wedding was called off. They had their daughter Sailor in December 2015 and married in June 2016 in a surprise ceremony.\n\nMessage: Dakota Meyer, 30, shared this photo of himself with his daughter Sailor, two, on Wednesday while speaking out against his ex-wife Bristol Palin, 27\n\nThe pair are now parents to Sailor, two, and Atlee, one. Bristol also has a nine-year-old son, Tripp, with her ex Levi Johnston, 28.\n\nIn his Instagram post, Dakota offered more details about the events that led to the cancellation of that first wedding and its aftermath. The pair had gotten engaged during a Rascal Flatts concert in Las Vegas in early 2015.\n\nDakota said on Wednesday that he had chosen to open up in order to respond to an exchange Bristol had on the Teen Mom Instagram account.\n\nThe pair are currently appearing on the new season of Teen Mom OG. While they have officially divorced, the show started filming while they were still together, and thus documents the dissolution of their marriage.\n\nDakota began his post, which featured a photo of him holding Sailor in his arms, by saying Bristol \'got pregnant right after [their] engagement\'.\n\n\'We planned a wedding with our families and friends and Bristol decided to leave me a week prior,\' he added. \'I spoke with her family every month and made it clear I would be the father of my child.\n\n\'I reached out to her before Sailor was born and asked what the plan was to co-parent. She told me to go through the courts to establish paternity.\'\n\nOpening up: The former Marine took to Instagram Stories to share more thoughts about his divorce from Bristol and the circumstances of their split\n\nDakota opened up about the circumstances of Sailor\'s birth, adding: \'I wasn\'t invited to the birth and found out my child was born on Twitter \xe2\x80\x94 can you imagine being a dad and not being allowed to be at your child\'s birth?\'\n\nHe added about Bristol: \'She denied my paternity until it could be proven, at which point Sailor was born. For Bristol to state that Sailor didn\'t have a dad is laughable \xe2\x80\x94 what really happened is Bristol kept our daughter from having a father present at birth and until the courts ruled that I was her father.\n\n\'I can promise you this, Sailor and Atlee always had a dad, and always will have a dad.\'\n\nBack when Bristol announced her pregnancy, a month after her and Dakota\'s canceled wedding, she initially didn\'t disclose whether the former Marine was the father of her child.\n\nIn January 2016, DailyMail.com revealed exclusively that Dakota was being forced to take a paternity test in an increasingly bitter battle over custody of Sailor.\n\nDakota also took to Instagram Stories to answer questions from his viewers regarding his relationship with Bristol and their split.\n\nHe said he did file for divorce from his wife, saying he only did so after she told him she wanted a divorce and had \'already met with an attorney first\'.\n\nDakota acknowledged his PTSD and anxiety, which Bristol has cited as important factors in their split, adding: \'but I wasn\'t married to anyone perfect\'.\n\nFamily: The father said he has a \'week on, week off\' custody arrangement with Bristol and advised other people to cherish their loved ones\n\nBristol Palin and Dakota Meyer\'s relationship: a timeline Bristol and Dakota met in 2014 during the filming of Sarah Palin\'s Sportsman Channel show Amazing America. The pair got engaged during a Rascal Flatts concert in Las Vegas in early 2015. Bristol and Dakota (pictured in an archive Instagram shot) met in 2014 during the filming of Sarah Palin\'s Sportsman Channel show Amazing America They planned a wedding in Dakota\'s home state of Kentucky, which was called off at the last minute in May 2015. Bristol and Dakota\'s first daughter together, Sailor, now two, was born in December 2015. In early 2016, it was revealed that Dakota was being asked to take a paternity test as part of a bitter battle over custody of Sailor. Dakota and Bristol tied the knot in June 2016. In December of that year, Bristol, who also has a nine-year-old son called Tripp with her ex Levi Johnston, 28, announced she was expecting her third child \xe2\x80\x94 her second with Dakota. She gave birth to their daughter Atlee, now one, in May 2017. It emerged in February this year that Dakota had filed for divorce. Bristol confirmed in August that the proceedings had been finalized. Advertisement\n\nWhen one Instagram user asked Dakota when he knew enough was enough, he replied: \'I knew enough was enough when I would hear her talk to her family in front of me and say ""I can\'t believe I wasted three years with a mother f***er like this.\'\n\nAnother person asked Dakota whether he ever feared he might hurt someone while having a PTSD episode, to which he said: \'That\'s such a great question. No, absolutely not. I\'ve never put my hands on Bristol. I\'ve never hurt Bristol. I\'ve never said anything to Bristol she hasn\'t said to me, so let\'s clarify that.\'\n\nThe father also revealed that he has a \'week on, week off\' custody arrangement with Bristol and admitted that he does have a nanny, adding \'but I also have a job hahaha\'.\n\nBristol and Dakota, who met in 2014 during the filming of Sarah Palin\'s Sportsman Channel show Amazing America, have publicly discussed their relationship on social media and in interviews recently amid their appearance on Teen Mom OG.\n\nOn Monday evening, Bristol took to her Instagram Story to react to the latest episode of the MTV show. She then deleted the many messages she had posted in relation to the show from her Story, leaving only a photo of herself tuning into the program with her son Tripp at her side.\n\nMonday\'s episode saw Dakota warning viewers about being with someone who \'[doesn\'t] want to be there for you\' or is \'not strong enough\', while Bristol said her two-year marriage was \'at a breaking point\' after Dakota\'s PTSD rendered him anxious and sleep-deprived.\n\nSpeaking out: On Monday, Dakota did another Instagram Q&A, and this time spoke out to reiterate that he will not be getting married again, while sharing a rather imposing photo\n\nSpeaking out: Bristol called \'BS\' on her ex-husband on Monday evening while watching a Teen Mom OG segment documenting the dissolution of their marriage\n\nWhile it\'s unclear which specific segment prompted Bristol to react to the footage on her Instagram Story, she shared images of Dakota during the episode with the words \'K... kind of BS\' written over the footage.\n\nShe then highlighted the fact that Dakota was the one who filed for divorce, and said that she only \'put [her] foot down\' and decided the pair should go through with the breakup because she thought it would be best for her children.\n\nOn her Instagram Story, Bristol shared a message from a person accusing her of \'leaving your husband when he needs you the most\', telling Bristol her behavior is \'sickening\'.\n\nBristol replied by saying: \'Let\'s just get a few facts straight\' before posting a series of updates. In the first, she called Dakota an \'incredible father\' and reminded her Instagram followers that they only see \'.002\' of her and Dakota\'s lives on the show.\n\n\'Like Dakota has said multiple times on IG and in interviews... Our marriage was over WAY BEFORE TMOG,\' she added.\n\nOpening up: Bristol highlighted the fact that Dakota was the one who filed for divorce and expressed her respect for his service as a Marine\n\nBristol then said Dakota moved out of the family home \'more times than [she] would ever like to admit\'.\n\n\'He got an attorney. He filed for divorce,\' she added. \'Wait, did you read that? He filed for divorce.

Mayfield shared the same pic and caption on her Instagram account, adding a few bunny and baby emojis for good measure.\n\nThe Hart of Dixie actor and the casting producer met back in 2008 when he was filming FNL in Texas, where she was a cheerleader at the University of Texas at Austin. They married on April 20, 2013, in front of guests including Porter\xe2\x80\x99s former costars Taylor Kitsch and Gaius Charles.\n\nIn February 2015, the couple revealed they were expecting a baby boy. \xe2\x80\x9cLittle guy is going to have a tough time deciding who to root for \xe2\x80\xa6 but we\xe2\x80\x99ll love him no matter what school he chooses \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d Porter captioned a photo of two tiny football jerseys \xe2\x80\x94 one for Texas and one for Nebraska (his home state) \xe2\x80\x94 hanging on a clothesline.\n\nLittle guy is going to have a tough time deciding who to root for\xe2\x80\xa6but we\xe2\x80\x99ll love him no matter what school he chooses\xe2\x80\xa6right @kiwiporter? #housedivided #PorterOnTheWay A post shared by skittishkid (@skittishkid) on Feb 12, 2015 at 12:24pm PST\n\nMayfield gave birth a few months later in May, and Porter tweeted the experience to his fans. \xe2\x80\x9c30 hours in.

"b'Hoda Kotb returned to her second home Monday morning.\n\nKotb joined Savannah Guthrie and Matt Lauer on ""Today"" for the first time since announcing on Feb. 21 that she had adopted a daughter, Haley Joy Kotb.\n\n""It\'s everything,"" she said of motherhood. Kotb added that she would regularly tune in to see her colleagues work when she was on maternity leave. ""I saw everybody,"" she said, ""and I\'m blubbering like a baby.""\n\nFans lined Rockefeller Plaza to herald Hoda\'s return.\n\nAdmitting she\'d ""been a mess"" all morning, Kotb said she was nervous to be back on camera. ""I\'m scared to be sitting here,"" she shared. ""I\'m a little afraid that I might explode into tears.""\n\nLauer lightened the mood, joking, ""I thought it was \'cause you were miserable being back and you just broke down in tears, but it\'s just all of the emotions of the last two and a half months.""\n\nThough they had visited her at home, Guthrie and Lauer were glad to see Kotb back at work in Studio 1A.\n\n""I\'m feeling great. I don\'t think I\'ve ever been this happy,"" Kotb said, reaching for a box of tissues to dry her eyes. After regaining her composure, the 52-year-old fourth-hour ""Today"" co-host said, ""I\'m going to get professional! OK, I\'m ready.""\n\nKotb then got back to business. Six minutes later, Al Roker appeared via satellite from Washington, D.C., where he was reporting on the 139th annual Easter Egg Roll at the White House. ""Mwah! I miss you,"" the weatherman said. ""I\'ll bring you back some eggs for Haley Joy.""\n\nAfter receiving a ""hug chain"" from fans, Kotb admitted it was ""a little hard"" saying goodbye to her daughter before work.\n\n""But, I have to tell you, when I walked in, there\'s something about looking into the eyes of people who are just happy for you that makes me explode, which is why I was doing that with all of you guys and everyone who is out here,"" she said with a big smile. ""I\'m blessed to be able to have this great family and a little girl at home waiting for me.""\n\nToday Show Family Album\n\nAt 8:10 a.m., Kotb opened up about her adoption journey and revealed how motherhood has changed her.\n\n""You think that by a certain stage in your life, I\'ve had every experience that I\'ve had, and then all of a sudden she shows up,"" the journalist said. ""I felt like in my life, I\'ve had joy beyond what I could have imagined, but this is beyond a dream. Like, you had your dreams--and then this. I never believed in love at first sight until now.""\n\nKotb joked that Haley ""probably thinks it\'s raining in her nursery, because I\'m always looking at her and crying on her.""\n\nHaley is the missing puzzle piece, she added. ""When they first handed me Haley, I was scared to hold her, and when they first put her in my arms, it was a perfect fit.""\n\nThe Origins of Hoda Kotb and Kathie Lee Gifford\'s Friendship\n\nBefore she decided to become a parent, Hoda feared it might be ""too late,"" as she\'d already been through cancer and a divorce. ""You just think, \'OK, I don\'t get everything and it\'s OK.\'""\n\nAfter a while, though, she began to wonder, ""Why not me?"" With her mind made up, she talked it over with her boyfriend, Joel ""Boots"" Schiffman.\n\n""I said to Joel, I want to ask you something, and this is a big deal. I want you to think about it. I don\'t want you to answer right away.\' I said, \'I would like to explore adoption with you,\'"" Kotb said. ""He said, \'I don\'t need a minute. I\'m in.\'""\n\nHaley Joy is better than she ever envisioned. ""When I look at her I see forever. I see past me,"" Kotb gushed as tears streamed down her cheeks. ""I see the future, which I guess I never saw.""\n\n""I want her to know she is loved by me, by my family and by everyone who\'s held her,"" Kotb said at the end of the segment. ""I don\'t think she\'s going to know what to do with all the love.""\n\nBack in the studio, Kotb told Dylan Dreyer, Lauer and Guthrie, ""She is something. She\'s something. She\'s changed everything about me. Everything. Like, every single thing about me.""\n\nLauer, 59, added, ""Joel is the perfect partner for this. He is such a wonderful, warm, great guy.""\n\n""Anyway, I have baby!"" Kotb said, trying to keep the tears at bay again. ""I have a baby! Hello! Thank you for making me feel so good. Coming back has been amazing. Thanks for loving me.""\n\nWhen the 10:00 a.m. hour with Kathie Lee Gifford began, Kotb received a gift basket that included books, a lullaby album and a sash. Gofford cheered Kotb and laughed, ""Joel\'s daughter is finally graduating college and now he\'s got a brand new baby.""\n\nKotb joked, ""Here we go again!""\n\nShe again became emotional while discussing this new chapter of her life.\n\n""I\'ve loved her, I think, my whole life,"" Kotb said of Haley Joy. ""I think since forever."" As Kotb wiped away her tears, Gifford said, ""She looks like you--she\'s got a big head and huge feet!""\n\n""I love it,"" Kotb laughed. ""I love her head.""\n\nAfter waiting so long to become a mom, Kotb doesn\'t want to miss a moment of her baby\'s life. ""I sleep in the room with her so that whenever she starts crying I\'m ready. When it\'s like 6:00 or last wakeup, I walk over and...I look at her and she\'s hungry and she needs changing. And I go, \'Well, good morning nugget.\' She gets a smile: \'Hi.\' Just like that,"" she told Gifford. ""I swear to you, if I could live in that moment...you know how you wish moments could last forever?""\n\nEven in her ""worst moments"" as a mom, Kotb focused on gratitude: ""Because I would have begged \xe2\x80\x94 begged \xe2\x80\x94 for a day like this. I would have begged for that kind of day, to have a child. I don\'t know why I\'m crying! I cry over everything! I\'m normally not like this. I\'ve become crazy!""\n\n""You can\'t believe how your heart can feel,"" Kotb added. ""I can\'t believe it feels this way.""\n\nKotb, who apologized to viewers for ""so much baby talk,"" then told Gifford, ""I cannot believe this is my life...By the way, I am taking my time. I am enjoying moments that I know I would have raced through...As I\'m doing it, I\'m trying to linger, savor...enjoy every moment.""\n\n""I didn\'t know that I could feel that kind of contentment \xe2\x80\x94 just so satisfied with everything,"" Kotb said around 10:35, adding that she ""turned off"" her electronic devices to focus on what matters: making memories with her daughter.\n\n""I realized there\'s so much love to be had,"" she told Gifford, ""and I think sometimes it\'s smart to block some of the negativity that\'s out there in the world and realize that your world could be beautiful \xe2\x80\x94 if you keep it tight like that.""\n\n(E! and NBC are both members of the NBCUniversal family.)'"
"b'Charlie Hunnam vows his marriage was terrible.\n\nDuring an interview with the Associated Press in Las Vegas March 30, the Sons of Anarchy actor recounted his hasty 1999 wedding to actress Katharine Towne, who he had met at a Dawson\xe2\x80\x99s Creek audition. Listen to what he said in the video above!\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFirst time I was ever in Vegas I got married, which didn\xe2\x80\x99t turn out that well,\xe2\x80\x9d Hunnam, 37, said. \xe2\x80\x9cI had known the girl for three weeks. We had fallen madly in love and it was the first time I had ever been in love.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe pair decided to elope before Hunnam, then 18, had to head back home to England. \xe2\x80\x9cWe thought, \xe2\x80\x98What if we never see each other again? Let\xe2\x80\x99s get married and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll have to see each other again even if it\xe2\x80\x99s just to get divorced,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d he recalled. \xe2\x80\x9cSo we came to Vegas, but I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t even get a drink so I actually didn\xe2\x80\x99t think I would be able to get married.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut anything goes in Sin City. At 2 A.M., Hunnam and Towne said \xe2\x80\x9cI do\xe2\x80\x9d in front of Silver Bell Wedding Chapel\xe2\x80\x99s Reverend RJ Cotton. (They wanted to get married by Elvis but \xe2\x80\x9che left the building,\xe2\x80\x9d joked Hunnam.)\n\nThe end result: \xe2\x80\x9cThree terrible years,\xe2\x80\x9d admitted Hunnam, whose divorce was finalized in 2002. \xe2\x80\x9cThree terrible, painful, expensive years. I got the cats at the end of it, so that was good. There was a small victory.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe\xe2\x80\x99s since gone on to find success in his 12-year relationship with jewelry designer Morgana McNelis.

(\xe2\x80\x9cIt like had to be something that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t, like, far-out celebrity baby name, but it also couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be a generic name,\xe2\x80\x9d Konner says about the name Grover. \xe2\x80\x9cShe knew he had to be the only one in the class with that name.\xe2\x80\x9d)\n\nThe last episode of Girls flashes forward five months to Hannah and Marnie co-parenting Grover together. Hannah is struggling to bond with her son, can\xe2\x80\x99t get him to breastfeed, and is breaking down over the anxiety of it all. Marnie, in her Type A way, picks up all the slack, which overwhelms her to the point that she calls Hannah\xe2\x80\x99s mom, Becky Ann Baker\xe2\x80\x99s Loreen, to come give Hannah a wake-up call.\n\nAmid Hannah ignoring Grover\xe2\x80\x99s crying, napping all day, and wandering the streets with no shoes or pants on\xe2\x80\x94of course\xe2\x80\x94Loreen tells her, \xe2\x80\x9cYou made the choice to have this child, and guess what? It\xe2\x80\x99s the first one you can\xe2\x80\x99t take back.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAs for the all-important final shot, of which there was much speculation about going in to Sunday night, particularly in terms of what music would play, it\xe2\x80\x99s of Hannah\xe2\x80\x99s reaction after Grover finally latches onto her breast, after which she starts singing Tracy Chapman to herself. \xe2\x80\x9cJenni was like, \xe2\x80\x98I wonder if anyone\xe2\x80\x99s guess is \xe2\x80\x98Fast Car\xe2\x80\x99 lightly mumbled,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Dunham laughs.\n\nSo with the finale finally having aired, here\xe2\x80\x99s our conversation with Dunham and Konner about the choices made, why last week\xe2\x80\x99s penultimate episode purposefully felt like more of a series finale, whether they ever considered Hannah having an abortion, and how think piece culture affected the end of the show.\n\nYou named the baby Grover.\n\nJenni and Lena, in unison: We diiiiid!\n\nI imagine there\xe2\x80\x99s a certain amount of pressure in naming Hannah\xe2\x80\x99s baby. Why Grover?\n\nJenni: Lena literally showed up one day and walked into the writer\xe2\x80\x99s room and was like, \xe2\x80\x9cHis name is Grover.\xe2\x80\x9d And we were all like, \xe2\x80\x9cYeah that sounds about right.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLena: We did not have a baby name list. We were just like, \xe2\x80\x9cThat seems like what she would name her baby.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nJenni: It like had to be something that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t, like, far-out celebrity baby name, but it also couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be a generic name. She knew he had to be the only one in the class with that name.\n\nI would venture he\xe2\x80\x99ll be the only Grover Horvath.\n\nLena: It couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be trendy but it also couldn\xe2\x80\x99t freak you out.\n\nJenni: The truth is that when we shot Riz [Ahmed], we went back to that. That was a little improv on the day where it was, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat if it\xe2\x80\x99s his idea?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLena: Jenni walked into that little funny set we had for his hotel room, and was like, \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s try a version where he says Grover would be a great name for the baby.\xe2\x80\x9d It\xe2\x80\x99s funny, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we even told Riz that was the baby\xe2\x80\x99s eventual name. Jenni just fed him that line and he did it. I only told him recently that the baby\xe2\x80\x99s name was Grover and he was like, \xe2\x80\x9cShe took my suggestion!?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n[Jenni cracks up]\n\nJenni: The great part, too, is that Lena just realized\xe2\x80\x94this wasn\xe2\x80\x99t in our minds when we did it\xe2\x80\x94that she bets he got it from Sesame Street.\n\nLena: There\xe2\x80\x99s no way that guy knows the name Grover from anything else. He\xe2\x80\x99s definitely not talking about Grover Cleveland.\n\nA lot of people thought last week\xe2\x80\x99s episode could have worked as a series finale in its own right. What was behind the decision to focus the last half-hour on Hannah and the baby?\n\nJenni: We had a lot of story we wanted to tell. Judd was like, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you make a finale that\xe2\x80\x99s a finale, like a satisfying \xe2\x80\x98here\xe2\x80\x99s where everybody ends up,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d but we didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to skip the part where Hannah becomes a mother. Like, how unfair to spend this whole season wondering what kind of mother Hannah would be and then never show it?\n\nLena: Also, our show\xe2\x80\x99s never been about the traditional, tidy wrap-up. We wanted to be able to enjoy that beautiful musical montage moment [from last week\xe2\x80\x99s episode] that\xe2\x80\x99s given us chills and so many other people chills. But we\xe2\x80\x99re also ending the way we\xe2\x80\x99ve always ended everything, which is just like without a massive and clean conclusion.\n\nIt does feel appropriate.\n\nLena: We really felt like we got the best of both worlds and it was really fun because Nisha Ganatra, a director we love but had never worked with came and did episode nine and lent a very different feeling to it, and had the vision for the Hannah moving vs. party intercutting. And then Jenni got to come in and do an off-kilter but totally committed version of the energy that our show traditionally has.\n\nSome TV creators have an ending in mind as early as when they pitch a show. At what point did you realize that this is how you wanted the series to end, with Hannah having her baby and confronting motherhood?\n\nJenni: I have to say Lena\xe2\x80\x99s been talking about it for a long time.\n\nLena: I said something about it pretty early, I think sometime between seasons one and two. I mean Jenni and I started talking about endings the night we premiered at SXSW. We were at a hotel in Austin, hotel rooms upstairs and downstairs from each other but obviously talking on our cell phones. We basically talked until we fell asleep about what would become of every character, what the rest of her life would look like, how she would die, and I feel like somewhere in that conversation we said something like, \xe2\x80\x9cWho would be the first person to have a baby?\xe2\x80\x9d And we were like, \xe2\x80\x9cMaybe it\xe2\x80\x99s Hannah.\xe2\x80\x9d It always felt oddly natural to us, and it\xe2\x80\x99s really been an interesting litmus test. We\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten some beautiful emails from women who have chosen or not chosen, who have been forced into single motherhood for various reasons.\n\nJenni: Really moving.\n\nLena: And I\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten some really moving emails from women who got pregnant and not chosen to have it. Last week I got a donation in my name to Planned Parenthood with a letter from a woman who said she chose to have an abortion, but that watching Hannah\xe2\x80\x99s journey had made her feel more confident in her own decision. And, like, that\xe2\x80\x99s the kind of thing that you can\xe2\x80\x99t believe how lucky you are when you can spur anyone to think or feel that way. Then there\xe2\x80\x99s definitely been the people who have been like, \xe2\x80\x9cThis women could never have a baby, she\xe2\x80\x99s going to drop it on its head, what the hell are you doing?\xe2\x80\x9d Probably one of my favorite lines of Jenni\xe2\x80\x99s of all time is when I said there are a lot of people who would be worse mothers than Hannah, and Jenni said, \xe2\x80\x9cYeah, like anyone on any Showtime show.\xe2\x80\x9d It was a great Showtime inside baseball joke.\n\nI think there were people who were surprised when the pregnancy storyline was introduced that it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t used to make a statement about abortion. Was that a route you ever considered?\n\nJenni: I mean we\xe2\x80\x99ve tackled abortion, you know? It would have been such a weird move, in my opinion, to, this late in our series, write that she gets pregnant and has an abortion. She\xe2\x80\x99s right on that line of it could happen or it couldn\xe2\x80\x99t happen, and the fact that Joshua [Patrick Wilson\xe2\x80\x99s character] assumes it\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen is very offensive to her. I think what\xe2\x80\x99s interesting about the growth of these characters is that the second episode of the show is Jessa\xe2\x80\x99s pregnant and there\xe2\x80\x99s not a conversation for a second whether she would keep it or not.\n\nLena: Not at all.\n\nJenni: It\xe2\x80\x99s not in the realm of possibility.\n\nLena: Mimi Rose had an abortion and we didn\xe2\x80\x99t even know she was pregnant.\n\nJenni: Now we get to a place where it\xe2\x80\x99s a few years later and it becomes a conversation, and that seemed like a really interesting idea of growth to us.\n\nLena: Completely. Plus I was like, you can not like our storyline but you certainly can\xe2\x80\x99t come for my and Jenni\xe2\x80\x99s pro-choice bona fides.\n\nThe line that lingered with me most from the finale was when Hannah\xe2\x80\x99s mom says, \xe2\x80\x9cYou made the choice to have this child, and guess what? It\xe2\x80\x99s the first one you can\xe2\x80\x99t take back.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nJenni: I think that line is what the entire finale is about. Here\xe2\x80\x99s this girl who\xe2\x80\x99s been accused by everyone in the world\xe2\x80\x94in her world, in the world of viewers, everyone\xe2\x80\x94of being narcissistic so constantly. She\xe2\x80\x99s a girl who quits a job she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like and leaves a relationship she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like. This is the first thing she can\xe2\x80\x99t take back. We\xe2\x80\x99re saying to you: this is it. This is Hannah with high stakes. Now we\xe2\x80\x99re showing you high stakes.\n\nLena: I remember right before I made Tiny Furniture I very spontaneously quit a job as a hostess.\n\nJenni: Which we see in the movie!\n\nLena: Yep! My dad yells at me, like, \xe2\x80\x9cThis is so irresponsible. If you had a baby or anyone depending on you, you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be allowed to just go around quitting jobs!\xe2\x80\x9d And I remember looking and going, \xe2\x80\x9cYeah! But I don\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d It was this moment where I was like, I don\xe2\x80\x99t, and I\xe2\x80\x99m going to keep quitting things as long as I can. I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna take all the naps I want and quit all the things I want. And this is the moment when Hannah can\xe2\x80\x99t take all the naps she wants and quit all the things she wants. She truly can\xe2\x80\x99t anymore.\n\nThere was a lot of curiosity about what song would play over the credits of the final episode, to the point that articles were written speculating about it.\n\nJenni: I know! We\xe2\x80\x99ve been seeing all these articles. I was like, I hope no one turns it off too fast because you can hardly hear the song.\n\nLena: Jenni was like, \xe2\x80\x9cI wonder if anyone\xe2\x80\x99s guess is \xe2\x80\x98Fast Car\xe2\x80\x99 lightly mumbled.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHow did you land on \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Fast Car\xe2\x80\x99 lightly mumbled?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nJenni: This is a Judd thing. We decided not to use really almost any music through the episode, so that\xe2\x80\x99s scary and unusual for us. I knew I wanted to hear Allison singing \xe2\x80\x9cFast Car.\xe2\x80\x9d That was just a fantasy of mine, so we did it there. We were trying to figure out how to do the end and Judd said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat if it\xe2\x80\x99s just Hannah kind of mumble-humming \xe2\x80\x98Fast Car\xe2\x80\x99 in this weird way?\xe2\x80\x9d We called her up. She recorded it on her phone, sent it to us, and it was absolute perfection. We didn\xe2\x80\x99t even change it for the final mix.\n\nDo you think the microscope the show has been under throughout its run and the culture of think pieces surrounding it influenced how you wrapped the show up at all?\n\nJenni: I mean it had to have seeped in, because we\xe2\x80\x99re not made of wood. But I do think that this is an idea that we had so early on that we weren\xe2\x80\x99t in think piece territory quite yet, and the internet bombardment either. I\xe2\x80\x99ve always said I\xe2\x80\x99d rather have people loving or hating than yawning. We\xe2\x80\x99re really lucky that we go that, and especially this season that people cared so much, like with the Matthew Rhys episode, writing so much about it. And caring so much about last week\xe2\x80\x99s penultimate episode. As much as we were not trying to cater to people, it feels really heavenly to have people understand what we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to do and really appreciating it. It\xe2\x80\x99s been a nice thing to go out with so much positivity.\n\nLena: The thing I was going to say about the think piece aspect is that I think we did a really successful job of in some ways cocooning ourselves. We made really intentional choices to seclude ourselves and we always had our work to return to in this really beautiful, private way. That really sustained me and made it feel possible to make choices outside of what the internet might be demanding. By the way, the internet is such a terrible psycho beast, where they want to tell you what to do but if you actually did what they told you to do, the bullies would then call you a weakling because you did what they told you to do.\n\nWe\xe2\x80\x99re talking on Friday evening. How are you spending the airing of the finale Sunday night?\n\nJenni: We\xe2\x80\x99re in separate cities. Lena and Allison and her parents are going to watch it. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what I\xe2\x80\x99m going to do. Maybe I\xe2\x80\x99ll watch it with Judd.\n\nLena: Not being with Jenni is super weird, and I would be on her sofa in two seconds. But we have to be in different cities right now. Being with Allison will be really special and emotional. She\xe2\x80\x99s basically crying already and has already asked what I want to eat, two extremely Allison qualities. I think there will be a lot of texting Jenni pictures of whatever my face is doing.'"
"b'The 10 best (and five worst) TV series finales of all time\n\nKelly Lawler | USA TODAY\n\nShow Caption Hide Caption \'The Americans\' Keri Russell and Matthew Rhys: Spy vs. Spy ""The Americans"" stars Keri Russell and Matthew Rhys: What do they love (and hate) about each others\' characters?\n\nThere\'s nothing like the anticipation, expectation and dread that surrounds the finale of a beloved TV series.\n\nThis year, three long-running shows \xe2\x80\x94 New Girl, The Middle and The Americans \xe2\x80\x94 said goodbye with three satisfying finales. But that\'s not always the case. Sometimes, no matter how much you love what came before, a series can miss on its last swing, leaving a bitter taste for years to come.\n\nWe\'ve ranked the 10 best and five worst of all time, from golden classics (M*A*S*H) to recent travesties (How I Met Your Mother).\n\nPrefer to listen? Our geek culture podcast, The Mothership, debates the best and worst series finales of all time.\n\nSubscribe for free on Apple Podcasts | Stitcher | SoundCloud\n\nThe best\n\n1. Six Feet Under (HBO)\n\nSix Feet Under was always about facing our own mortality (it was, after all, about a family-run funeral-home business), and the near-perfect finale faced the great beyond head-on in its excruciatingly beautiful last sequence, which flashed forward to the deaths of all the main characters \xe2\x80\x94 predictable, tragic or absurd. Every series finale that\xe2\x80\x99s used the flash-forward technique owes a great debt to Six Feet.\n\n2. Newhart (CBS)\n\nAs twisty and self-referential as modern TV has gotten, no show could possibly pull off a twist as shocking and meta as the finale of Newhart, which is perhaps better remembered than the show itself. After Dick Loudon (Bob Newhart) is hit in the head with a golf ball, the show cuts to Dr. Robert Hartley, Newhart\'s character from his previous series, The Bob Newhart Show, waking up from a dream in bed with his wife. All eight seasons of Newhart, set in a Vermont inn, were Hartley\'s dream. Not even Westworld could do better.\n\n3. M*A*S*H (CBS)\n\nIn a poignant, emotional and still top-rated finale, the 11-year run of M*A*S*H (eight years longer than the Korean War it depicted) came to an end as Hawkeye Pierce (Alan Alda) and (most of) the rest finally went home. The sometimes dark final episode, which manages one last ""war is hell"" moment, perfectly captured the spirit of the series.\n\n4. The Mary Tyler Moore Show (CBS)\n\nJust thinking about that loving final hug is enough to make any MTM fan tear up. The finale ended in the sad, inescapable way many jobs in the real world do. The new owner of WJM fired the entire TV newsroom (well, except Ted), and the former co-workers came together to say goodbye. It felt realistic and emotional, just like most of MTM\'s run.\n\n5. Battlestar Galactica (Syfy)\n\nThe finale to the space epic succeeded where Lost failed, finding a way to use the spiritual and divine to answer its mysteries while making a profound statement about the nature of humanity. Sure, some are still angered by the deus ex machina convenience of the messy, benevolent god guiding the humans and cylons alike, but the relationship between creators and their creations was always the central tenet of the series. And even though the humans and the cylons gave up technology to start a simpler life on Earth, the flash forward to modern robotics also emphasized the show\'s themes: All this has happened before, and will again. So say we all.\n\n6. The Sopranos (HBO)\n\nThe only bad thing you can say about The Sopranos finale is that it pushed the saturation of Journey\'s Don\'t Stop Believin\' to the breaking point in the years that followed. Some fans didn\'t take to the open-ended, cut-to-black finale of the mobster drama, which didn\'t reveal whether Tony Soprano (James Gandolfini) lived or died, but his life was too nebulous to be resolved so cleanly.\n\n7. The Shield (FX)\n\nNot every series about an anti-hero is interested in comeuppance at the end, but even if it did, no punishment would be as perfect as the one served to Vic Mackey (Michael Chiklis) in the final episode of the police drama. Mackey ends up in his own version of prison, wasting away at an office job, far from the action and adrenaline he craves.\n\n8. Cheers (NBC)\n\nSam\'s (Ted Danson) true love was always his bar. The Cheers finale isn\'t nearly as happy or funny as many sitcoms\' exits, but its wistful tone worked for the bittersweet episode. The gang couldn\'t stay at the bar forever.\n\n9. Breaking Bad (AMC)\n\nLike any figure so tragic and Shakespearean, Walter White (Bryan Cranston) couldn\'t survive the end of his story. The cancer-ridden chemistry teacher-turned-drug kingpin had finally admitted his malicious acts were purely for pleasure, but was able to at least partially redeem himself by helping Jesse (Aaron Paul), one of the people he hurt the most.\n\n10. The Americans (FX)\n\nSpoiler alert: The Soviet spy series just concluded its six-year run Wednesday, and the emotions are still running high, so maybe in a few years it wouldn\'t make this list. But the episode, which found Philip (Matthew Rhys) and Elizabeth (Keri Russell) returning to the Soviet Union after the FBI finally figured out they\'re illegals, was perfectly suited to the series. They left behind their unwitting son, Henry (Keidrich Sellati), and their comrade daughter, Paige (Holly Taylor), leaves them. This is as close to a happy ending as the series could offer, at once surprising and deeply satisfying.\n\nThe worst\n\n1. How I Met Your Mother (CBS)\n\nThe finale of the long-running young-friends-in-New York sitcom was legendary, for all the wrong reasons. The episode finally introduced Ted (Josh Radnor) to the mother (Cristin Milioti) of his future children and then, in a series of flash-forwards, proceeded to kill her off and have Ted rekindle his relationship with Robin (Cobie Smulders) after she divorced Barney (Neil Patrick Harris). Had the show not proved that Ted and Robin were a bad couple many times over, and had it not set the entire last season at Robin and Barney\'s wedding, it might have been able to pull off this ending. Instead, it marked a classic example of a series that mapped out a plan from the beginning but shouldn\'t have stuck to it.\n\n2. Seinfeld (NBC)\n\nThat\'s it? The decision to end the beloved sitcom about a group of New York misanthropes by putting them in jail for being bad Samaritans is now 20 years old, but age hasn\'t helped it.\n\n3. Lost (ABC)\n\nA show that wove as many mysteries into its fabric as this supernatural drama did was always bound to dissatisfy some with its conclusion, but the easy, schmaltzy way that the series gave everyone a perfect happy ending in the afterlife was the worst choice.\n\n4. Dexter (Showtime)\n\nThe serial-killer drama started to decline long before its much-derided finale, but that didn\'t help soften the blow of Dexter\'s (Michael C. Hall) bizarre decision to fake his own death and take up life as a somber lumberjack.\n\n5. Charmed (WB)\n\nThe witchy series almost came to an end after seven seasons before getting a reprieve for an eighth. But the finale to Season 7 was a far better way for the Halliwell sisters to exit \xe2\x80\x94 leaving their witch lives behind and going undercover with new identities \xe2\x80\x94 than the actual finale, in which the trio won perfect relationships and lived happily ever after. Charmed often subverted fairy-tale tropes, so the fairy-tale ending didn\'t track.'"

"b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe Walking Dead\xe2\x80\x9d Season 8 has promoted three actors to series regular status, Variety has confirmed.\n\nSteven Ogg, Katelyn Nacon, and Pollyanna McIntosh will all have expanded roles when the AMC zombie apocalypse series returns this fall. Ogg plays Simon, the right-hand man to Savior leader Negan. Nacon is Enid, a teenage resident of Alexandria who has shown a connection to Carl. McIntosh plays one of the newest characters on the show, Jadis, leader of the junk yard scavengers.\n\nSeason 7 of the series saw the departure of several main cast members, including Steven Yeun and Michael Cudlitz, whose characters, Glenn and Abraham, were killed in the season opener. Sonequa Martin-Green, who played Sasha, died in the season finale. She will next star in the CBS All Access series \xe2\x80\x9cStar Trek: Discovery.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSeason 8 will pick up amidst the war between Rick\xe2\x80\x99s alliance and The Saviors.

It\xe2\x80\x99s the Kingdom and the Hilltop too. The Governor just wanted them dead. Negan would be happy if everyone was alive and well and working for him. There\xe2\x80\x99s a very basic political idea at play here. They want to live in a fair world instead of having it just be Negan\xe2\x80\x99s.

"b'In 1969, a nun in Baltimore went missing. Two months later, her body was found. Her name was Sister Cathy Cesnik. She was a beloved 26-year-old teacher at the local Archbishop Keough High School, and her death left the community confounded: Who would want to hurt this woman? Decades later, the case is still unsolved\xe2\x80\x94but the circumstances around it have grown wild and complex, with police desperate to determine if Cesnik\xe2\x80\x99s death had anything to do with a major sexual abuse scandal at the school. What did she know? And who, ultimately, used that information against her?\n\nThe mysterious murder is coming to light this spring thanks to Netflix, which is releasing a seven-part docu-series about Cesnik\xe2\x80\x99s death titled The Keepers. A new trailer, released on People, is giving true-crime fans a first look at the series, and is already striking an ominous, conspiratorial tone.\n\nThe trailer\xe2\x80\x99s main action is led by locals who knew Sister Cathy, particularly two former students who have never stopped trying to solve the devastating murder. After Cesnik\xe2\x80\x99s death, many quickly linked her case to the alleged covered-up sexual-abuse scandal by priest Father Joseph Maskell, who was accused of sexually abusing dozens of school girls. He later paid settlements to his accusers, per People.\n\nBut two of the accusers, Jean Wehner and Teresa Lancaster, decided to participate in the Netflix documentary, directed by Ryan White. The series digs into the allegations, attempting to untangle the dark web Maskell\xe2\x80\x94whom White describes as a \xe2\x80\x9csociopath\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94allegedly weaved, and trying to bring to light all the insidious participants who helped him get away it.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a story of accountability and, at best, dozens of people and institutions dropped the ball and didn\xe2\x80\x99t protect children and adults,\xe2\x80\x9d White tells People. \xe2\x80\x9cAt worst, dozens of people and institutions covered things up so it could never be brought to light or were directly involved in crimes.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe adds that while many of the alleged perpetrators, including Maskell, died before being brought to justice, \xe2\x80\x9cthere are people still alive who I do believe need to be held accountable.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTrue-crime stories have always been at the forefront of pop culture, but there\xe2\x80\x99s been a boom in recent years, thanks to the explosive success of podcasts like Serial, HBO\xe2\x80\x99s series The Jinx, and Netflix\xe2\x80\x99s own Making a Murderer. However, retelling crime stories often presents a problem when it comes to finding a fitting ending. Serial, for example, had an amazing run, but ended on a \xe2\x80\x9cYou be the judge\xe2\x80\x9d note that left many grasping for a more concrete finale. But though White was never focused on solving the murder of Sister Cathy, he feels strongly that the ending of this docu-series, unlike many true crime stories before it, will be promising: \xe2\x80\x9cI finished this project thinking this murder can be solved.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nViewers will be the judge of that when Netflix releases the series on May 19.'"
"b'Melissa Etheridge has revealed that smoking cannabis with her children has brought them closer together.\n\nThe GRAMMY-winning singer became an activist for the drug after using it for medicinal purposes during her battle with cancer and says her kids now refer to it as medicine.\n\n\n\nWATCH: Melissa Etheridge Says Brad Pitt Was Almost Her Sperm Donor\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy children have a very clear understanding of cannabis,\xe2\x80\x9d the 55-year-old mom of four told Yahoo during an interview for their Weed & the American Family report. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I hold it without shame or confusion they can understand it as simple as if I was pointing to a bottle of Percocet and saying, \xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s mama\xe2\x80\x99s medicine.\xe2\x80\x99 You take the naughtiness out of it and it\xe2\x80\x99s not something kids then run to.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have smoked with my older two,\xe2\x80\x9d Etheridge continued, referring to 20-year-old daughter Bailey and 18-year-old son Beckett. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was funny at first and then they realized it\xe2\x80\x99s a very natural end-of-the-day and it brings you closer, so I\xe2\x80\x99d much rather have a smoke with my grown kids than a drink.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe Kansas native underwent a lumpectomy and several rounds of chemotherapy and radiation after being diagnosed with breast cancer in 2004.

Going through chemotherapy is suffering\xe2\x80\xa6 and cannabis helps so many parts of just that. That\xe2\x80\x99s just the beginning of what it does medicinally.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI smoked to be normal. I smoked to be out of pain.

Instead of being normal people and doing anything else, these internet trolls opted to berate members of the cast and crew, with Tran receiving the brunt of their efforts.\n\nThere isn\xe2\x80\x99t proof, but a Facebook group with the unwieldy name \xe2\x80\x9cDown With Disney\xe2\x80\x99s Treatment of Franchises and Its Fanboys\xe2\x80\x9d claimed responsibility for the online harassment.

"b'Daisy Ridley on porgs, Kylo Ren and more \'Star War: The Last Jedi\' teasers\n\nBryan Alexander | USA TODAY\n\nShow Caption Hide Caption Daisy Ridley talks porgs love and that \'Last Jedi\' scream Daisy Ridley is a beautiful suspect in \'Murder on the Orient Express.\' But the star is getting ready to board \'Star Wars: The Last Jedi.\' Here\'s what we learned about her upcoming adventure.\n\nDaisy Ridley can\'t escape her Star Wars fame, even as a mysterious murder suspect riding the opulent 1930\'s train in Murder on the Orient Express.\n\nWhile filming Murder (in theaters now), director Kenneth Branagh offered to let Ridley use a lightsaber in a key scene (she declined) and co-star Josh Gad peppered her with Star Wars questions offset on video, even pulling in Judi Dench for one Force interrogation.\n\nWe, too, had a few queries as Ridley gets set to ride as Rey again in Star Wars: The Last Jedi (opening Dec. 15). Here\'s what we learned.\n\nRidley is so pro-porgs (Rey not so much).\n\nThe free world fell in love when the chubby porgs creatures made a screaming debut in The Last Jedi trailer last month. It hit Ridley, too. She lists a porgs toy as one of her prized possessions.\n\n""It\xe2\x80\x99s bringing a lot of pleasure right now,"" says Ridley, calling the character ""adorable"" and ""hilarious.""\n\nMore: Daisy Ridley leaps from \'Star Wars\' to force awakening in \'Murder on the Orient Express\'\n\nAnd: Daisy Ridley leaps from \'Star Wars\' to force awakening in \'Murder on the Orient Express\'\n\nThe love affair started on set with the goofy looking puppet, operated by the same crew who handle droid BB-8. ""It\xe2\x80\x99s wonderful to be working around practical things on set that have such personality,"" says Ridley,\n\nBut Rey won\'t fall for the creature\'s charms. ""Rey, honestly, is too wrapped up in her own journey to pay attention to porgs,"" says Ridley. ""Which is a sad thing.""\n\nSnoke will provide the worst kind of \'test\' for Rey.\n\nSupreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis) ain\'t pretty and acts worse. ""He looks mental. Snoke is an evil guy, if you can call him a guy,"" says Ridley.\n\nLast Jedi\'s trailer shows Rey screaming under Snoke torture. Ridley says the torture scenes were long enough to leave her hoarse. ""It was painful. My throat hurt after that one,"" says Ridley.\n\n""Snoke is one of those tests for Rey,"" she adds. ""And when I say testing, it\'s the worst use of testing ever.""\n\nWatch for Kylo Ren and Rey time.\n\nIs there something special going on with Rey and the Dark Side-dwelling Kylo Ren (Adam Driver)? The two seem to have a special connection in the trailers.\n\nRidley choses her words carefully.\n\n""These are two people who represent two very different sides of life, good and evil,"" she says. ""That\'s going to be explored more in this.""\n\nLuke Skywalker is annoyed with Rey.\n\nRey is expecting Luke Skywalker to be thrilled to get his lightsaber back in Last Jedi. But he\'s not happy to see her. ""She thinks there\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a warm welcome. But Luke went to this island to get away and he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to be disturbed,"" says Ridley.\n\nDon\'t fret. Skywalker takes ""a tremendous journey from the beginning of the relationship to ultimately where they end up in the film."" Our personal theory: He had coffee.\n\nJudi Dench really doesn\'t know squat about Star Wars.\n\nDench seems to be a Star Wars nut, grilling Ridley in one of Gad\'s videos on fan-minutia such as whether she had been tested for midi-chlorians, living cells in tune with the Force (from Episode I \xe2\x80\x93 The Phantom Menace).\n\nShe played the part well, but Dench doesn\'t have Force fever.\n\n""She was like, \'Medi...Midi-chlorians, what is that?\' Josh and I had to explain,"" says Ridley, who says she had Gad had to stifle their laughs when cameras rolled.\n\nDench did ask Ridley to shoot a personal Star Wars video for her grandson. ""Obviously he\'s very interested.""'"

"b'Almost a year after Prince was found unconscious in his Paisley Park home, search warrants from the investigation of his death were released on Monday, revealing that prescription medications were found all over his house, NBC News reports.\n\nAccording to reports by E!, the documents filed last year provide clearer view into the days leading up to the star\xe2\x80\x99s accidental opioid overdose, including medications he acquired without prescriptions. According to the affidavits, substances were found within the compound, particularly in places that Prince regularly visited, like his bedroom and laundry room. Many pills were found stored in bottles for other medications, often in vitamin bottles. Per NBC News, some were in a suitcase labelled with a Prince alias, Peter Bravestrong, along with a handwritten lyrics to the 1987 hit \xe2\x80\x9cU Got The Look.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAccording to E!, several medications were prescribed to Prince\xe2\x80\x99s longtime friend and aide, Kirk Johnson. Dr. Michael Todd Schulenberg, who saw Prince twice before his death, arrived on the premises on April 21 to drop off test results and when later questioned by authorities, NBC News reports he confessed that he prescribed oxycodone on April 16, 2016, the same day that the pop star\xe2\x80\x99s plane made a post-concert emergency landing when he \xe2\x80\x9cpassed out\xe2\x80\x9d while aboard after taking pain killer medication.\n\nWarrant says that Schulenberg told investigators he put it under Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s name \xe2\x80\x9cfor Prince\xe2\x80\x99s privacy.\xe2\x80\x9d The doctor\xe2\x80\x99s attorney, however, said in a statement that he \xe2\x80\x9cnever directly prescribed opioids to Prince, nor did he ever prescribe opioids to any other person with the intent that they would be given to Prince.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAccording to NBC News, investigators discovered a suitcase next to Prince\xe2\x80\x99s bed and found at least two bottles with pills prescribed by Schulenberg under Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s name on April 7: the anti-nausea drug ondansetron hydrochloride in a Vitamin D bottle, and the painkiller Percocet in a bottle labeled as ondansetron.\n\nAccording to E!, documents stated that Johnson contacted Schulenberg to ease Prince with hip pain, for which he prescribed clonidine, hydroxyzine pamoate and diazepam, medications typically used for anxiety and high blood pressure. Johnson picked up the medicines the day before Prince\xe2\x80\x99s death and claimed it \xe2\x80\x9cwas the first time he had ever done something like that for Prince.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nJohnson told investigators he was \xe2\x80\x9cunaware Prince was addicted to pain medication.\xe2\x80\x9d But Andrew Kornfeld, the son of Dr. Howard Kornfield, who founded the Recovery Without Walls told detectives that Johnson had contacted them because the famed musician was struggling with opiate use, E! reports.\n\nPer search warrants, Andrew was visiting the compound on the day of Prince\xe2\x80\x99s death to determine if the singer could be a candidate of their program. He was also found to be carrying several envelopes containing pills when he came to Paisley Park on that day, but did not have any prescriptions for them and is not a licensed doctor. He denied to officials that he had any intention of treating Prince with the medication.\n\nOther revelations in the warrants, as per NBC News, stated that Prince communicated via his landline phone and through email, he stopped using cellphone after being hacked. Authorities also learned he had been in a romantic relationship with singer-songwriter Judith Hill since 2014. Hill was with Prince when he was briefly hospitalized after his plane made an emergency landing. Prince didn\xe2\x80\x99t have a regular doctor for most of his career and his team would arrange for a various doctors to give him B-12 shots before his performances.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe investigation remains active at this point,\xe2\x80\x9d The chief deputy for the Carver County Sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s Office Jason Kamerud told The New York Times. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve gained a lot of progress over the last year, but there still is some more work to be done.\xe2\x80\x9d'"
"b'\'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2\': On set with Marvel\'s misfit space family\n\nBrian Truitt | USA TODAY\n\nShow Caption Hide Caption How Chris Pratt and Kurt Russell became space family Kurt Russell and Chris Pratt talk about playing an estranged father and son in \'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2\' and bonding in real life.\n\nCorrection & clarifications: An earlier version of this report misidentified the location of Pinewood Studios. It is south of Atlanta.\n\nFAYETTEVILLE, Ga. \xe2\x80\x94 Chris Pratt has the most awesome space dad ever.\n\nOn this sunny afternoon at Pinewood Studios just south of Atlanta, Kurt Russell is holding court on the set of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (in theaters Thursday night), telling stories over a campfire. Not tales from Big Trouble in Little China or Escape From New York, though \xe2\x80\x94 Russell is in cosmic character as Ego, a living planet who\xe2\x80\x99s just met his long-lost son, Peter Quill, aka Star-Lord (Pratt).\n\nYes, you read that right: Russell plays an all-powerful living planet and that\'s not even the craziest aspect of the Guardians\xe2\x80\x99 corner of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. A talking raccoon, a sentient alien tree with a three-word vocabulary (""I am Groot"") and the rest of this misfit accidental family took the world by storm with the 2014 runaway summer hitGuardians of the Galaxy. The sequel \xe2\x80\x94 which is on track to open with $150 million domestically \xe2\x80\x94 doubles down on the eye-popping new worlds, over-the-top personalities and family drama.\n\nTrailer: \'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2\' Baby Groot steals the show in \'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2.\'\n\n""Guardians has gone from being an untested, little-known risky Marvel side project with an unusual cast and offbeat sensibility, to a premier brand worthy of its ascension to the coveted opening summer weekend slot,"" says Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for comScore.\n\nThe biggest asset at the heart of this sci-fi space opera? A crew of \xe2\x80\x9cdamaged souls who are looking for some form of love or redemption and haven\xe2\x80\x99t really ever experienced either of those things,\xe2\x80\x9d says returning writer/director James Gunn.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe reason why so many people love this movie and feel so connected to these characters is because they\xe2\x80\x99re utterly outcasts and oddballs and strange,"" Gunn says. ""They\'re not the Avengers, they\'re not the pitch-perfect group of guys who have everything going on. They\xe2\x80\x99re losers often, and even though they have some extraordinary abilities, they\xe2\x80\x99re no better or worse than we are.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe Guardians \xe2\x80\x94 the rogueish Star-Lord, assassin Gamora (Zoe Saldana), overly literal warrior Drax (Dave Bautista), sarcastic yet damaged Rocket (voiced by Bradley Cooper) and adorably precocious Baby Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel) \xe2\x80\x94 have already saved the universe, though Peter is still in search of his real father after having been raised from childhood by space outlaw Yondu (Michael Rooker).\n\nThe sequel has them on the run from the conceited aliens known as the Sovereign, and after having saved the heroes from certain doom, Ego is enjoying a meal with his son on the forest planet Berhart, though Peter is curious why Dad never came back for him when his mother died and instead hired Yondu to pick him up.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would have done so myself, but I was in the midst of an outlandish adventure battling demonic forces to save this dimension or some such nonsense. I don\xe2\x80\x99t even recall. It all bleeds together after a while,\xe2\x80\x9d Ego explains. He wonders aloud why Yondu kept Peter instead of returning him, leaving Ego searching for his boy ever since.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I was a skinny kid who would squeeze into places adults couldn\xe2\x80\x99t and it made thieving easier,\xe2\x80\x9d says Quill, clad in a shirt sporting an alien candy logo.\n\nYet there\xe2\x80\x99s as much humor as serious stuff in a Guardians film, and Drax is the first to break the tension. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought Yondu was your father,\xe2\x80\x9d he says, leading everyone to look at the muscular warrior like he\xe2\x80\x99s nuts.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait. After all this time hanging out together, you thought Yondu was my blood relative?\xe2\x80\x9d Quill says in exasperation, leading Drax to deadpan, \xe2\x80\x9cYou look exactly alike.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRocket chimes in \xe2\x80\x9cOne\xe2\x80\x99s blue!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 though Cooper hasn\'t yet added the furry guy\xe2\x80\x99s vocals.

They\xe2\x80\x99re not quite the way you had made them out to be in your imagination.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAdds Gunn: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a father/son story that could take place if your father\xe2\x80\x99s a living planet in another galaxy or if your father\xe2\x80\x99s a Wall Street broker.""\n\nPratt is effusive with praise for his legendary co-star Russell. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a dream. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been a huge fan of his for ages. There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing disappointing about working with him,\xe2\x80\x9d says the actor, who enjoyed Russell\xe2\x80\x99s frequent stories from his heroic roles in such movies as Tombstone and Tango & Cash.\n\nSo how does an icon like Russell play a planet? He leans into the machismo and quirks of those old parts. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of baggage that\xe2\x80\x99s right for this in terms of the kinds of things I can bring as an actor to the table,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd some of the things we created years ago have an element of connection to this character.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nGamora is skeptical of Ego\xe2\x80\x99s extreme interest in Peter, though she\'s also dealing with her adoptive sister and frenemy Nebula (Karen Gillan), a villain from the first film whom the Guardians have taken captive. Nebula is looking extremely irked while handcuffed as everybody else is gobbling Ego\xe2\x80\x99s blue space chow. (It\xe2\x80\x99s not very good, Russell reports. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s prop Jell-O. We never ask questions, we just eat it.\xe2\x80\x9d)\n\nBut everybody needs and seeks a sense of belonging, even Nebula. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s been raised to be a killing machine and not have any empathy or emotion,\xe2\x80\x9d Gillan says. \xe2\x80\x9cHowever, she has these natural feelings toward her sister that she\xe2\x80\x99s trying to suppress but can\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSaldana is just glad to have more women around \xe2\x80\x94 not just Gillan but also new cast member Pom Klementieff, who plays the Guardians\xe2\x80\x99 insect-like telepathic ally Mantis. \xe2\x80\x9cThe older I get, the more I realize that it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty lonely being the only female in the cast,\xe2\x80\x9d Saldana says. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re going to be surrounded by a whole bunch of dudes talking about their (manhood) and bodybuilding and eating healthy.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShe loves her dudes, though, and there\xe2\x80\x99s a connection between the stars of that original Guardians. Saldana is proud of how Pratt lost weight and got fit for the first movie while \xe2\x80\x9cstill remaining this super-humble and sweet and charming individual,\xe2\x80\x9d and she\xe2\x80\x99s continually wowed by Bautista\xe2\x80\x99s gentleness and subtlety.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe doesn\xe2\x80\x99t believe that he\xe2\x80\x99s funny,\xe2\x80\x9d Saldana says. \xe2\x80\x9cI hope that day doesn\xe2\x80\x99t come where Dave goes, \xe2\x80\x98You know what, you\xe2\x80\x99re (messing) up my take here.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMore than anyone, the success of the original Guardians has been career-making for Bautista, a former pro wrestler who parlayed Drax into a high-profile role as the villainous Mr. Hinx in the 2015 James Bond movie Spectre.\n\nHis Marvel character looks like \xe2\x80\x9ca powerhouse who\xe2\x80\x99ll rip your head off and then he says something completely ridiculous,\xe2\x80\x9d says Bautista, though as emotionally scarred as he is, \xe2\x80\x9cthere\'s definitely a sense of innocence about him.\xe2\x80\x9d Drax also has a body full of tattoos, and Bautista had a sauna outside of his trailer to soak off all the makeup and prosthetics daily. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d think I\xe2\x80\x99m like a diva with a sauna. But no.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nDrax meets his quirky match in Klementieff\xe2\x80\x99s Mantis, and the French actress is impressed that Gunn is so good at casting. \xe2\x80\x9cEverybody he chose has a big heart and I think it shows on screen.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe director wears his fandom on his sleeve, with pop-culture references aplenty and scads of Easter eggs and cameos born from a lifetime of reading comic books. ""Anybody can delve into comic history and pull out obscure characters,\xe2\x80\x9d says Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige. \xe2\x80\x9cNot everybody can turn them into emotionally resonant and relatable characters that audiences can fall in love with.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nGunn says the emotion he feels for his family and friends is \xe2\x80\x9ca bigger inspiration than even the comic-book characters.\xe2\x80\x9d He dedicated the movie to his parents in the audience at Vol. 2\xe2\x80\x99s Hollywood premiere, and Gunn looks out for those closest to him.\n\nThe filmmaker went to bat for his close friend Rooker when it came to casting Yondu. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think I was Marvel\xe2\x80\x99s first choice. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure there are many other stars and actors that would have brought in more money,\xe2\x80\x9d Rooker says. \xe2\x80\x9cI wasn\xe2\x80\x99t in the room when he was convincing them, but I would bet you my right arm that he had my back in a big way.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd Sean Gunn embraces his status as \xe2\x80\x9cthe utility infielder of the Guardians cast\xe2\x80\x9d with pride. Watching his older brother\xe2\x80\x99s rise has been \xe2\x80\x9cprobably more fun and gratifying for me than just about anyone. I feel like I\xe2\x80\x99ve had a front-row seat to his success.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nJames Gunn has already started writing Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 to complete his trilogy, discussing the story with Pratt and having \xe2\x80\x9csome pretty intense conversations\xe2\x80\x9d with Saldana about a significant role in the threequel. The only travels Gunn has on his docket in the near future, though, are relaxing ones to \xe2\x80\x9cget my head on straight after three years of waking up and going to sleep and thinking about a talking raccoon.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIn the Marvel galaxy, there\xe2\x80\x99s room for more than one awesome space dad.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI love these characters,\xe2\x80\x9d Gunn says. \xe2\x80\x9cIncluding my father and my dog, my mother had eight kids, and I have all these Guardians. They\xe2\x80\x99re my kids.\xe2\x80\x9d'"
b'They haven\xe2\x80\x99t appeared together since the Academy Awards that brought them the Best Picture Oscar.

The exes were visibly upset with one another over how their relationship ended and what happened after they decided to call it quits, including Shay learning about the identity of Scheana\'s new boyfriend, Robert Valletta, for the first time.\n\nThough Scheana and Shay seemed to end the reunion on good terms, giving each other their best wishes as they embraced, the experience still didn\'t sit well with the SURver. ""I had sent him an email after the reunion because...I felt I was very harsh in certain parts of it, I felt a little cold in other parts of it, "" Scheana revealed to E! News prior to the reunion airing. ""And then, the way he found out about Rob, I felt I needed to just give a little more of an explanation. I felt like I just owed that to him because we\'ve been friends for half our lives.""\n\n\n\n\n\nScheana said that she never received a reply from Shay, but she heard through a mutual friend that he had read it, and ""that was enough for me,"" she said. ""I\'ve said my piece.""\n\nDuring the sit-down, Shay expressed that he felt like Scheana had betrayed him by talking about his struggle with substance abuse on the show. ""My job is to tell my story and put my life out there...I\'m sorry I\'m not going to keep my mouth shut about that anymore, we\'re not together anymore,"" Scheana told E! News in response. ""Me opening up about this has helped so many women, too.""\n\nScheana previously told The Daily Dish that, although coming face-to-face with Shay was difficult, it has ultimately helped her move on. ""It was weird, but I think that day did bring some closure to me, at least,"" she said.\n\nSee what else Scheana had to say about the emotional reunion, below.'"

"b'Save these ideas for later\xe2\x80\x94and follow Allure on Pinterest!\n\nOn Instagram, you may have seen your favorite beauty bloggers create looks inspired by Dominique D\'Angelo, a professional makeup artist with about 244,000 followers on Instagram. She tells Allure that not only is dotted liner a way of adding texture to your look in a nontraditional way, it is a ""comfortable step toward wearing something more daring than a classic liner. It can be as bold or as discreet as you\'d like.""\n\nWhat other makeup should you have on when you\'re wearing dot eyeliner?\n\nHughes recommends keeping the rest of your makeup low-key with a fresh face and groomed brows, so the dots don\'t look ""too theatrical."" Instead, keeping your skin matte and your brows natural creates a perfect balance\xe2\x80\x94you know, kind of like a hamburger with salad, Hughes explains. She even compared the vibe you should go for to Alicia Keys\'s appearance on our February cover. As for lips, you have free reign to top with whatever color you want. ""It\'s like pairing black liner with any lip color,"" Hughes says. Greta Agazzi, a professional makeup artist based in Italy, agrees. She tells Allure that she\'s into the minimalist look because it gives her ""mime vibes."" She\'s so right\xe2\x80\x94in the best way possible. You might not want to wear a black-and-white striped shirt, though. You know, just in case.\n\nFor Emma Robert\'s look, professional makeup artist Kara Yoshimoto Bua kept her look, which was inspired by Coco Chanel BTW, supersimple with neutral eye-shadow shades on the actress\'s lids. First, Bua smudged the taupe shade from the Tisse Camelia\n\nChanel Quadra Eyeshadow in Tiss\xc3\xa9 Gabrielle An eye-shadow palette with four cool, shimmery gray-based shades\n\nonto the lower lash lines. Next, she brushed a shimmery brown onto the outer part of Roberts\'s upper lash line for ""soft, natural definition,"" Bua says. Then, Bua swept a champagne powder on Roberts\'s upper lids, inner eyes, and brow bones to give her a lit-from-within glow. (These Best of Beauty-winning products can help you get there, too.) Then, she finished off with the petal pink shade on Roberts\'s creases.\n\nAnd just how do you get those damn dots so precise?\n\nJust last week, Flirt Cosmetics launched the Dot Dot Dot Dual Ended Liner ($22), which makes things hella easier. One side has your classic felt-tipped liner. The other has a special dotting applicator. Revlon also has a ball-point liner that has literally a ball point. Both option create the perfect spots. Hughes and D\'Angelo also suggest using the round end of a makeup brush. You can dip it into a black liquid lipstick (we like the one from Sephora Collection), gel liner or create your own mixture with some setting spray and black eye shadow like Hughes does. The latter lets you be ""in control of the consistency,"" Hughes says. ""A watery one works best.""\n\nAs for placement, use your pupils for alignment. Then, create dots either right below your lower lash lines, like Roberts\'s look, or below the folds and fine lines of your undereye area. Agazzi likes to wear them almost on top of her cheeks, so don\'t afraid to stray from your waterlines. And remember, as D\'Angelo says, \'Dot liner is fun, hard to mess up, and it washes off at the end of the day!\'""\n\nMore beauty looks you\'ll love:\n\nNow, learn more about the dot eyeliner look Pat McGrath created for Anna Sui:'"

"b'Sofia Coppola\'s newest project is bound to be your guilty pleasure of the summer. The Beguiled, based on the 1966 novel A Painted Devil by Thomas P. Cullinan, is set in an isolated Southern boarding school for girls during the Civil War. When a wounded Union soldier found nearby and treated at the seminary, his stay results in seduction, envy and betrayal.\n\nThe film boasts a star-studded cast: Nicole Kidman is headmistress Martha Farnsworth, Colin Farrell plays the soldier, Kirsten Dunst portrays a teacher named Edwina and Elle Fanning is her rival, a student named Alicia.\n\nThe Beguiled is actually a remake of a 1971 film of the same name, which starred Clint Eastwood in Farrell\'s role. Although the original movie revolved around the soldier, Coppola\'s edition puts the focus on the women, and their complex dynamic within their secluded setting.\n\n""The main crux of the story is about the dynamics between a group of women all stuck together, and then also the power shifts between men and women,"" Coppola told Entertainment Weekly. ""So for me, it\'s very universal, but it\'s in this exotic setting of the Southern gentility.""\n\nThe Beguiled comes to theaters on June 23.

Michael filed a lawsuit against the network in January 2016. The lawsuit states ""The series was nothing about the couple\'s happy marriage."" Obeng claimed that he was required to display an ""unrealistic and manufactured personality"" which could harm his business if the show is allowed to air. In a letter from his lawyer which was sent to E! Entertainment in August 2016, Obeng demanded that his children not to be included in the show. The letter identified the show under a new name Famously Married. Obeng is suing NBCUniversal the parent company of the E! Network. The suit seeks an injunction barring the network from airing or promoting the episode in which Obeng appears.[10]'"

"b'The couple\xe2\x80\x99s concerns about being kept away from Carly mounted in season 7. Catelynn broke down while the two were talking to Dawn after they had made plans to meet Carly\xe2\x80\x99s adoptive parents. \xe2\x80\x9cI try not to make it difficult,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, tearing up. ""I\xe2\x80\x99m willing and trying and offering. And then I get ignored for months and I try. I feel like I get punished because my kid asks questions about me, or she wants to know where she comes from. What [did they] think adoption is? She\xe2\x80\x99s going to do that.""'"

"b'She\xe2\x80\x99s back! In an unexpected and welcome surprise Sunday evening (4/29), Carrie Underwood was revealed to be the National Anthem performer ahead of the Nashville Predators\xe2\x80\x99 Stanley Cup playoff game.\n\nThe crowd, complete with red Nissan-sponsored light sabers, quickly jumped to their feet when the arena\xe2\x80\x99s announcer revealed the surprise guest to center ice. As each high note was hit, fans quickly applauded the country powerhouse\xe2\x80\x99s vocal abilities.\n\nUnderwood is a huge fan of the Nashville Predators, as both a resident of Music City and the wife of one of the players, Mike Fisher. She is often seen celebrating the team\xe2\x80\x99s triumphs from a box within Bridgestone Arena.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think going to the Stanley Cup Finals last year was such a confidence booster. I mean, nobody expected them to make it as far as they did. I did, but [laughs] nobody else. We seem to be the underdogs in every single situation. And seeing Mike and hearing Mike talking about those guys and how much talent was on the ice and how much they had in them, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t surprising to me at all that they made it to the finals last year,\xe2\x80\x9d Underwood said of the team spirit recently.\n\nOn Friday (4/27), the Preds faced an unfortunate loss against the Winnipeg Jets in game one of the second round of playoffs. After Sunday night\xe2\x80\x99s game, the teams will move to Winnipeg for the next few games.\n\nThe Oklahoma native performed the Star-Spangled Banner last year during the Predators first run in the Stanely Cup playoffs. Since then, many other country stars, including Dierks Bentley, Vince Gill, Maren Morris, among others, have taken to the ice for surprise performances.'"
"b'""In my life I go, \xe2\x80\x98Oh my goodness, look at all these beautiful wonderful things that I have, I should be so happy,\xe2\x80\x99 but you can\xe2\x80\x99t help it if you wake up in the morning and you are so tired and you are so sad and you are so full of anxiety that you can barely think,"" she says. Williams invited Gaga to participate after he read an open letter she issued through her Born This Way Foundation in which she revealed a sexual assault at 19 that left her with PTSD.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s time that everyone speaks up and really feels very normal about mental health; it\xe2\x80\x99s the same as physical health. Everybody has mental health and we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be ashamed of it and just having a conversation with a friend or family member can really make such a difference,"" William says from a room at Kensington Palace. ""For me, the little bits that I\xe2\x80\x99ve learnt so far is that it\xe2\x80\x99s really important to have this conversation. You won\xe2\x80\x99t be judged.""'"
"b'After Nick Viall and his pro partner Peta Murgatroyd were eliminated from \xe2\x80\x9cDancing With the Stars\xe2\x80\x9d Monday night, he was clearly disappointed but his initial reaction seemed gracious.\n\nThe recent \xe2\x80\x9cBachelor\xe2\x80\x9d star said the right things before the cameras, gushing about Murgatroyd and the whole \xe2\x80\x9cDWTS\xe2\x80\x9d experience, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cI had such an amazing time with Peta. She\xe2\x80\x99s a fantastic partner; we had fun all the time.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut behind the scenes it might have been a different story, with Viall reportedly attributing his failure to win enough votes from viewers to people and situations beyond his ballroom dance abiilty, according to the tabloid OK!\n\nViall felt that Murgatroyd, who gave birth earlier this year, didn\xe2\x80\x99t give it her all. He also was telling other cast members that he thought he was facing backlash over the recent arrest of fellow \xe2\x80\x9cBachelor\xe2\x80\x9d alum Chris Soules, a source told OK!\n\nSoules, who competed on Season 19 of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Bachelor\xe2\x80\x9d in 2015, was arrested last week in connection with a truck crash in Iowa that killed a 66-year-old farmer. Soules has been charged with leaving the scene of a traffic fatality and is being investigated for possibly driving under the influence at the time of the crash.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was not in a good mood after being eliminated and told cast members that he felt like Chris Soules\xe2\x80\x99 incident had an impact on him,\xe2\x80\x9d an insider told OK! \xe2\x80\x9cBasically, he was blaming everyone else but himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe OK! report didn\xe2\x80\x99t mention that \xe2\x80\x9cStar Trek\xe2\x80\x9d legend William Shatner, a rabid, high-profile \xe2\x80\x9cDancing WIth the Stars\xe2\x80\x9d fan, campaigned against Viall. Early in this season of the TV ballroom dance competition, Shatner took to Twitter to urge other viewers to vote Viall off the show.\n\nViall and Mugatroyd did an Argentine tango Monday night and received two nines and two eights from the judges, but it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t enough to keep them in the competition.\n\nThe site Wellpaint said it looked like Murgatroyd put a lot into her performances with Viall \xe2\x80\x94 and her effort probably brought the two of them further in this highly competitive season than most fans expected.\n\nAfter Viall was eliminated, he called his loss a \xe2\x80\x9cbummer\xe2\x80\x9d before being asked about Soules, who was said to be a friend of his. He called it a \xe2\x80\x9cterrible situation.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cObviously more than anything my heart goes out to the person who passed away and their family and I\xe2\x80\x99m just praying for everyone involved,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, according to E! News.\n\nWhether Viall is bitter about the \xe2\x80\x9cDancing With the Stars\xe2\x80\x9d exit, he has said that he\xe2\x80\x99s ready to leave behind the world of reality TV for good.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy time in reality TV is probably done,\xe2\x80\x9d the 36-year-old told Life & Style Weekly. Instead he\xe2\x80\x99s focused on launching a grooming line and spending more time with his \xe2\x80\x9cBachelor\xe2\x80\x9d fiancee Vanessa Grimaldi.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVanessa and I, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to keep doing our thing,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cDancing\xe2\x80\x99s over, that\xe2\x80\x99s a bummer, but I\xe2\x80\x99m really looking forward to the future and definitely spending more time with the business and Vanessa.\xe2\x80\x9d'"
"b""The Late Late Show With James Corden type TV Show genre Talk Show Where to watch Close Streaming Options\n\nIf you have been watching late night TV, you know Lip Sync Battle is far from the only battle in town. Starting almost a full year ago, The Late Late Show\xe2\x80\x99s unflappable host James Corden debuted new fixture called \xe2\x80\x9cDrop the Mic.\xe2\x80\x9d The fun segment finds the Carpool Karaoke maestro turning his vocal stylings up a notch and dishing rap disses as he squares off against various guests. The stars bring it, too, and the resulting rap battles have been a study in badass rhyming, quick thinking, and \xe2\x80\x94 wait for it \xe2\x80\x94 mic dropping. The segment has become so popular, in fact, that an independent stand-alone spinoff is set to debut this fall.\n\nFor a full dose of heated rap battles, read on for a roundup of every \xe2\x80\x9cDrop the Mic\xe2\x80\x9d moment with MC Corden and his celebrity opponents.\n\n1. James Corden vs. Anne Hathaway\n\nFor the first round of \xe2\x80\x9cDrop the Mic,\xe2\x80\x9d Corden faced off against actress and singer Anne Hathaway, and they both went there. Corden teased the actress for her turn as Oscars host, and Hathaway mused that the late night host\xe2\x80\x99s wife watches Seth Meyers instead. Both players had to hand it to the other \xe2\x80\x94 Hathaway reluctantly nodded after a jab that \xe2\x80\x9cthat was good,\xe2\x80\x9d and Corden observed that her diss about his One Direction game \xe2\x80\x9cwas actually mean.\xe2\x80\x9d In the end, the audience\xe2\x80\x99s applause made it clear who dominated this round.\n\nWinner: Anne Hathaway\n\n2. James Corden vs. David Schwimmer vs. Rebel Wilson\n\nAfter the first round went so well, Corden and co. whipped up another segment just the next day, and included some surprises. What was supposed to be a match between Schwimmer and Corden became a three-way fight when Rebel Wilson showed up \xe2\x80\x9ccompletely unannounced.\xe2\x80\x9d Corden mined Friends and even The People v. O. J. Simpson: American Crime Story for material against Schwimmer, and in turn, the actor who brought Ross Geller to life played dirty, wondering why Corden\xe2\x80\x99s wife married him: \xe2\x80\x9cMy bad, she blind?\xe2\x80\x9d Rebel killed in the end, though, serving up barbs for Schwimmer (\xe2\x80\x9cYour career\xe2\x80\x99s a mistake / It\xe2\x80\x99s like Ross and Rachel / It\xe2\x80\x99s on a break\xe2\x80\x9d) and Corden (\xe2\x80\x9cCarpool Karaoke, you think it\xe2\x80\x99s your big thing / But everyone is thinking, \xe2\x80\x98Shut up and let Adele sing!'\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\nWinner: Rebel Wilson\n\n3. James Corden vs. Kevin Hart\n\nCorden trotted out fellow funnyman Hart, and truly nothing was off the table. The host pulled out all the stops and made fun of Hart for his height (\xe2\x80\x9cYou might think like a man / But you\xe2\x80\x99re built like a boy\xe2\x80\x9d), even bringing out a step stool for the comic. Hart\xe2\x80\x99s response: a zesty \xe2\x80\x9cGet that out my face!\xe2\x80\x9d The Ride Along star wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to be outdone, though, and did what many of the participants have done by criticizing Corden\xe2\x80\x99s career: \xe2\x80\x9cI admit, most people nice to your face / Until they get home and realize you\xe2\x80\x99re not Ricky Gervais.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWinner: Kevin Hart (Are we sensing a pattern here yet?)\n\n4. James Corden vs. Cara Delevingne vs. Dave Franco\n\nNext we saw another three-way showdown, as both Delevingne and Franco showed up to shut down Corden on his own turf. After some rather off-color jokes, Franco scored his best line: \xe2\x80\x9cJames, your show ends at 1:30 every week / So hello to the pets whose owners fell asleep!\xe2\x80\x9d Both Franco and Corden picked on Delevingne for her unusually robust eyebrows, but the unfazed actress and model targeted both of her opponents with one effective gibe: \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re both shorter than me / And I think that you will find / I\xe2\x80\x99ve hooked up with hotter girls than both of you combined.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWinner: Cara Delevingne\n\n5. James Corden vs. Usain Bolt\n\nLast November, the \xe2\x80\x9cDrop the Mic\xe2\x80\x9d crew took things in a new direction, pairing Corden with Jamaican Gold medalist Usain Bolt. The two tried to intimidate each other, with Bolt assuring Corden, \xe2\x80\x9cAll I do is win.\xe2\x80\x9d Corden asked the athlete, \xe2\x80\x9cYou sure you\xe2\x80\x99re ready for this? / \xe2\x80\x98Cause you\xe2\x80\x99re on my track now.\xe2\x80\x9d Things started off nasty and went downhill from there, and the scales were definitely tipped against the TV host. Bolt took a swipe with this line: \xe2\x80\x9cYou never shoulda started / You probably shoulda fled / I run my race in 10 seconds / You last that long in bed!\xe2\x80\x9d And Corden came back with his own jab: \xe2\x80\x9cWhen your endorsements dry up / Hey, you can call me / We always need more PAs to run and get me coffee!\xe2\x80\x9d Good one, Corden, but in the end, the Olympic champion couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be beat.\n\nWinner: Usain Bolt\n\n6. James Corden vs. Riz Ahmed\n\nThe most recent matchup went down in April, with The Night Of star Riz Ahmed becoming the latest contestant to trade repartee with the British late night personality. Their jabs were both mean and topical, touching on Unites Airlines and Sean Spicer, but the best exchanges had to do with Ahmed in the Star Wars film Rogue One: \xe2\x80\x9cHonestly, it\xe2\x80\x99s mean to say in Star Wars he stinks / He made me miss the days of Jar Jar Binks,\xe2\x80\x9d taunted Corden. \xe2\x80\x9cYeah, I did do Star Wars / I bet that made you mad / Too bad they weren\xe2\x80\x99t tryin\xe2\x80\x99 to cast Jabba the Hutt\xe2\x80\x99s dad,\xe2\x80\x9d Ahmed rapped back. It was a pretty even match, but Ahmed swooped in with one last zinger: \xe2\x80\x9cYour jokes on the mic are spent / I saw you at Coachella / You were the big white tent.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWinner: Riz Ahmed"""

Has Munn already put Rodgers\xe2\x80\x99 family drama behind her?\n\nRadar Online reports that Munn was caught getting extra cozy with Trevor Noah this past weekend. The two allegedly met up twice over the extended weekend, including a romantic lunch in East Village.

The two appeared more than happy during their lunch, though it isn\xe2\x80\x99t clear if they are actually dating.\n\nMunn has not been spotted with other men since her breakup with Rodgers.

"b'Harry Styles knows that you care way more than you should about his relationship with ex-girlfriend Taylor Swift, and he\'s ready to play with your feelings a little more.\n\nOnstage at one of his concerts the other night, Styles mentioned Swift in such a sly way, that fans are already praying for a reunion. Wishing an audience member happy birthday, Styles asked how old she was turning, to which the fan replied, ""22."" It\'s not hard to guess what happened next.\n\nAnnouncing the news to the audience, Styles said, ""22. She\xe2\x80\x99s 22, okay? I don\xe2\x80\x99t know about..."" And as every Swift fan knows, that\'s exactly how the lyrics to ""22"" go. You can watch the whole interaction on Twitter:\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, Styles didn\'t launch into a full-on cover of ""22,"" although he should definitely consider doing so in a future set.\n\nStyles and Swift started dating in November 2012, and were photographed together for the first time in December the same year, when they were spotted in Central Park. Perez Hilton reported their breakup on January 7, 2013, with a source revealing, ""They are both really busy and never in one place for long.

"b'The timeless question that every parent must confront: how do we want to raise our children? To be happy, down-to-earth, and well-adjusted to the real world, most of us would say. Turns out that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what the Duchess and Duke of Cambridge would say too.\n\nRaising them her way\n\nMum Kate Middleton is definitely taking a no-nonsense approach to parenting, according to RadarOnline.com\xe2\x80\x99s palace sources. Far from being spoilt by attention, 3-year-old Prince George and 2-year-old Princess Charlotte \xe2\x80\x9chave absolutely no idea that they\xe2\x80\x99re royals\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey might look like perfect tots in photos, but at home they play in the mud, fall off ponies, and have screaming tantrums!\xe2\x80\x9d That\xe2\x80\x99s a description that no mum of toddlers would be surprised at.\n\nThe plucky mum is making sure her tots are raised with all the discipline and levelheadedness that normal children receive \xe2\x80\x94 royal tradition be damned. Kate shields her babies from the public as much as possible, according to one source. She has also told palace aides that \xe2\x80\x9cher kids will be raised her way\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would absolutely horrify Elizabeth. But Kate insists the kids should be allowed to be normal children. Never in royal history have the children in direct line to the throne been raised in such a modern way.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nKate is clearly drawing lessons from her own middle-class upbringing \xe2\x80\x94 her mum Carol was an air hostess with British Airways while her father Michael was a flight dispatcher.\n\nAnd the dauntless mum is proving that she isn\xe2\x80\x99t shy about defying centuries of royal tradition, all for the sake of her kids. Kate and William have reportedly enrolled little George in a normal middle-class school in suburban London.\n\nA more orthodox choice would have been William\xe2\x80\x99s first school, Wetherby Prep \xe2\x80\x94 a much more \xe2\x80\x9cposh\xe2\x80\x9d school.\n\nIn today\xe2\x80\x99s fast-changing world, many of us worry about how to prepare our kids for success. Sounds like Kate is taking charge of her little ones\xe2\x80\x99 futures early on!\n\nParenting rules Kate and William live by\n\nAll parents aspire to bring up humble, well-mannered children, and Kate and William certainly have a tougher job than most. So far, it\xe2\x80\x99s been amazing to see the couple\xe2\x80\x99s dedication to making sure their kids will grow up down-to-earth and gracious \xe2\x80\x94 royal or not.\n\nHere are some great insights that the royal mum and dad have given into their parenting approach over the years:\n\nTaking a break\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTime out\xe2\x80\x9d is a common method of discipline that parents turn to \xe2\x80\x94 Kate calls it \xe2\x80\x9ctaking a break\xe2\x80\x9d instead. When little George does something naughty, he sits in a corner of his room and plays with a special calming toy or fuzzy book.\n\nPlaying music\n\nWhen prince George throws a royal screaming fit, his parents play his favourite African drumming music. Sounds like a great way to calm down wailing toddlers without exhausting yourself!\n\nImitating his tantrums\n\nKate has an even more creative solution to little George\xe2\x80\x99s tantrums. When he throws a tantrum on the floor, the Duchess doesn\xe2\x80\x99t hesitate to get down and scream along. (Which mum hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been tempted to do that?) George finds this hilarious and it calms him right down.\n\nHelping to clean up\n\nLike all parents, Kate and William are no stranger to mealtime battles \xe2\x80\x94 flinging food on the floor, barfing sounds, the works. If George does this, the rule is that he must help clean up and won\xe2\x80\x99t get a replacement meal, only milk.\n\nLess things, please\n\nPrince William refused to divulge what gifts three-year-old Prince George received on his birthday in 2016, \xe2\x80\x9cI am not telling, he got too many things, he\xe2\x80\x99s far too spoiled.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWhile they certainly have the means to pamper their tots with material goods, the royal parents are clearly determined that George and Charlotte will grow up to value more important things in life.\n\nGiving them a normal life\n\nSpeaking to GQ last month, William revealed how dearly he valued normalcy for his children. \xe2\x80\x9cI want George to grow up in a real, living environment, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want him growing up behind palace walls, he has to be out there. The media make it harder but I will fight for them to have a normal life.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLike all parents, family is the centre of his world for this dad. \xe2\x80\x9cI could not do my job without the stability of the family. Stability at home is so important to me. I want to bring up my children in a happy, stable, secure world.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBeing a Modern Old-Fashioned Mom\n\nOne of Kate\xe2\x80\x99s go-to parenting guides is apparently The Modern Mother\xe2\x80\x99s Handbook: How To Raise A Happy, Healthy, Smart, Disciplined and Interesting Child, Starting From Birth. The anonymous author calls herself a Modern Old-Fashioned Mom, and her book offers no-nonsense tips for raising kids from bubs to teens.\n\nSome gems include \xe2\x80\x9cset a good example and then stand back and watch\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t force your kids to do things\xe2\x80\x9d. Definitely a page-turner if you\xe2\x80\x99re wondering how to square up traditional values with modern changes for your little ones.\n\nALSO READ: Princess Charlotte, Prince George got up to mischief at Pippa\xe2\x80\x99s wedding!'"

HE MADE ME FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE WITH HOW I IDENTIFY SEXUALLY SIMPLY BY HIS DISPLAY OF FREEDOM FROM AND IRREVERENCE FOR OBVIOUSLY ARCHAIC IDEAS LIKE GENDER CONFORMITY ETC.

My son loves [Trent] Reznor, and I told him, \'Before there was Reznor, there was Prince.\' And of course I\'ve heard stories that James Brown did that stuff, too; He would play drums, bass, could do just about it all. So it was kind of a progression. It\'s unusual to have somebody be that talented on so many instruments and yet still be a really good producer, songwriter \xe2\x80\x94 everything. ...It\'s a damn shame, it really is.

It is what made Prince outstanding and relevant forever. I will always love him.""\n\nCameron Strang, Chairman and CEO, Warner Bros. Records\n\nToday, we lost one of the most revolutionary talents of our time. Prince\xe2\x80\x99s untimely passing is deeply shocking, reminding us that unique artists who chart their own course and move culture are precious few and irreplaceable. He leapt onto the scene in 1978 and it didn\xe2\x80\x99t take the world long to realize that pop music had changed forever. He played the studio like an instrument and shattered the definition of live performance. He defined a new kind of superstardom, with a transformative impact not just on music, but on video, film, and style. Prince was the epitome of cool and mystery - an inspirational soul who created his own universe by bringing together different genres, races and cultures with a purity of sound and spirit unlike any other. His visionary gifts as a songwriter, vocalist, musician, performer and producer placed him in a league all his own. We are honored to have had Prince as a member of the Warner Bros. Records family during two eras of his astonishing career. We express our deepest condolences to everyone who loved him and join his family, friends and legion of fans in mourning his loss.\n\nCarmen Electra\n\n""I was so shocked and heart broken to hear about the loss of my mentor, Prince. The world has lost a truly incredible spirit and musical genius. What a blessing it is to be one of the chosen ones who had the chance to work so closely with him. He gave me my name, he believed in me, and he has inspired an entire generation. I will always love him\xe2\x80\xa6. \xe2\x80\x9cSometimes it Snows in April.""\n\nGeorge Miller\n\n""We used one of his songs in \'Happy Feet\'. We wanted to change two words of his lyrics to suit the penguins. He asked to see the movie. As it finished he picked up his guitar and said he wanted to write a song for us. It arrived completed soon after. As I was about to listen to it for the first time I thought \'what if I don\'t like it?\'. How do I tell this legendary figure his song doesn\'t fit? A few seconds in I began to smile. By the end I was dancing. It was perfect. A true genius and a true gentleman. He called me \'mister\' I wanted to call him \'your majesty\'. Such an astonishing loss.""\n\nAlbert Magnoli, Writer, Director and Editor of Purple Rain\n\n""The news of Prince\xe2\x80\x99s sudden and unexpected passing is very difficult to process. He was my creative partner and friend. We shared tremendous times together during and after the making of Purple Rain. I know his fans are devastated. I know his music meant so very much to so many people. He was a good man, complicated and diligent, and like men of his caliber, he always demanded from himself and others the very best. Travel well, friend, wherever your next journey takes you.""'"

She knew it was going on, but I guess this time she\xe2\x80\x99s had enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nA rep for Melo declined to comment on allegations of his cheating or the report that he impregnated a stripper who works at a New York gentlemen\xe2\x80\x99s club over six months ago. The dancer allegedly is demanding money for medical bills and other baby expenses.\n\nA source close to Melo added, \xe2\x80\x9cThe stripper pregnancy rumor is not true.

"b'The Telegraph\n\nThe final moments of Asif Kapadia\xe2\x80\x99s magnificent film Diego Maradona are almost too painful to watch. To a soundtrack of an interview conducted when he was at the peak of his powers in Napoli, when he talks of the football pitch being a refuge, a sanctuary, a place of freedom where he could express himself without fear, we see Maradona in his late fifties attempting to play five-a-side with his friends. The juxtaposition of the glorious athlete of our collective memory and the hobbling, pot-bellied, arthritic shadow he became is a telling reflection of his decline. So precipitous was his fall, it almost appeared to be the consequence of a Faustian pact, an agreement to become the most influential footballer in the world in exchange for a sporting afterlife of misery and self-loathing. The sadness is that any evaluation of his genius cannot but take account of what happened next. It had been long coming, but we were given first indication of his unravelling at the 1994 World Cup. The man who had dragged his country to victory in 1986, then almost repeated the trick in 1990, was by now a drug-addled parody of his glory days. His goggle-eyed celebration when he scored his last ever goal for his country in the game against Greece was a symptom of his personal nightmare: the man was wired beyond repair. Banned, traduced and shamed, his playing career was over. But back in his homeland he was still revered. And no wonder, given what he had delivered. He parlayed his celebrity into a lucrative turn as a chat show host, before his inability to control his appetites compromised his facility to frame a question. Still, he knew about football, so in 2005 he was offered a role as sporting director at Boca Juniors, his old club in Buenos Aires\xe2\x80\x99s most roughhouse neighbourhood. In a stadium that, 25 years after he last kicked a ball there, remains a shrine to his brilliance, his very presence was an inspiration; Boca won four trophies in two seasons with him watching enthusiastically from his private box. In a manner that was to become a pattern, though, it did not last. He fell out with the club president and was gone.'"

Nevertheless, it\xe2\x80\x99s a smart match, if it\xe2\x80\x99s not too bold to say.\n\nIf you need even more Turner family news, the fifth movie will introduce audiences to Will and Elizabeth\xe2\x80\x99s son, Henry (Brenton Thwaites), who embarks on a search for answers about his father, accompanied by fierce academic Carina (Kaya Scodelario) and, of course, rum-soaked raisin Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp).\n\nPirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales arrives in theaters May 26.'"

"b'For other people named Richard Simmons, see Richard Simmons (disambiguation)\n\nMilton Teagle ""Richard"" Simmons (born July 12, 1948) is a semi-retired American fitness instructor, actor, and video producer, known for his eccentric, flamboyant, and energetic personality. He has promoted weight-loss programs, most prominently through his Sweatin\' to the Oldies line of aerobics videos.\n\nSimmons began his weight-loss career by opening his gym Slimmons in Beverly Hills, California, catering to the overweight, and he became widely known through exposure on television and through the popularity of his consumer products. He is often parodied and was a frequent guest of late night television and radio talk shows, such as the Late Show with David Letterman and The Howard Stern Show.\n\nHe continued to promote health and exercise through a decades-long career and later broadened his activities to include political activism \xe2\x80\x93 such as in 2008 in support of a bill mandating non-competitive physical education in public schools as a part of the No Child Left Behind Act.[1][2]\n\nBy March 2016, after his retreat from the public since February 2014, speculation and expressions of concern about his well-being began to surface in the media.[3][4] Both Simmons and his publicist said the concerns were unwarranted as he simply chose to be less publicly visible.[5]\n\nDuring the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, Simmons began to upload archive content to his YouTube channel (recorded before his decision to withdraw from public life) to help people stay fit at home.[6]\n\nEarly life [ edit ]\n\nSimmons was born Milton Teagle Simmons in New Orleans, Louisiana on July 12, 1948[citation needed] to Leonard Douglas Simmons Sr. and Shirley May (n\xc3\xa9e Satin). He was born to ""show business parents"" and raised in the French Quarter of New Orleans. He has one older brother named Leonard, Jr.[7] His father was raised Methodist and worked as a master of ceremonies and later in thrift stores. His mother was Russian Jewish and was a traveling fan dancer and later a store cosmetics saleswoman.[8]\n\nSimmons later converted to Catholicism and attended Brother Martin High School (then known as Cor Jesu High School).[9][10][11] He attended the University of Louisiana at Lafayette before graduating from Florida State University with a BA in Art.[12]\n\nHe became obese during his early childhood and adolescence.[13] He began to overeat and became overweight as early as the age of 4 or earlier, and by the age of 5, he knew it was perceived negatively.[13] At the age of 15, he weighed 182 pounds (83 kg). As a young man, he considered being a priest.[14][15] As a young adult art student, he had appeared among the ""freak show"" characters in the Fellini films Satyricon (1968) and The Clowns (1970) and he eventually reached a peak of 268 pounds (122 kg).[16][13][17]\n\nIn an interview with the Tampa Bay Times, Simmons explained he adopted the name Richard after an uncle who paid for his college tuition.[15] His first job in New Orleans was as a child, selling pralines at Leah\'s Pralines.[14]\n\nCareer [ edit ]\n\nFitness career [ edit ]\n\nUpon moving to Los Angeles in the 1970s, Simmons worked as the ma\xc3\xaetre d\'h\xc3\xb4tel at Derek\'s, a restaurant in Beverly Hills.[8]:157 He developed an interest in fitness. Exercise studios of the day favored the already fit customer, so there was little help for those who needed to gain fitness from an otherwise unhealthy state. He established gyms, and his interest in fitness helped him lose 123 lb (56 kg).\n\nHe later opened his own exercise studio, originally called ""The Anatomy Asylum,"" where emphasis was placed on healthy eating in proper portions and enjoyable exercise in a supportive atmosphere. The business originally included a salad bar restaurant called Ruffage, a pun on the word roughage (dietary fiber), though it was eventually removed as the focus of the Asylum shifted solely to exercise.[18] Later renamed ""Slimmons,"" the establishment continued operations in Beverly Hills and Simmons taught motivational classes and aerobics throughout the week.[19] Slimmons closed in November 2016.[20]\n\nIn 2010, Simmons stated he had kept off his own 100+ pound (45 kg) weight loss for 42 years, had been helping others lose weight for 35 years, and that in the course of his fitness career, had helped humanity lose approximately 12 million pounds (5.5 million kg).[21] Simmons used the Internet as a method of outreach by running his own membership-based website and also has official pages on numerous social networking sites, such as Facebook, Twitter, MySpace, and YouTube.[22]\n\nIn media [ edit ]\n\nSimmons began to draw media attention due to the success of his health club that began with him on Real People, where he was shown at work. He introduced customers whom he had helped to lose weight. He later had guest roles on Battlestars, Body Language, Super Password, Win, Lose or Draw, Match Game (ABC), Price Is Right, $25,000 Pyramid, Hollywood Squares (syndicated), and Nickelodeon\'s Figure It Out.[citation needed]\n\nPositive viewer reactions landed Simmons a recurring role as himself in General Hospital over a 4-year period.[23] This, as well as being in shopping malls, where he taught exercise classes, led to further media attention. In the early 1980s, Simmons hosted two shows \xe2\x80\x93 Slim Cookin and the Emmy Award-winning talk show The Richard Simmons Show, in which he focused on personal health, fitness, exercise, and healthy cooking. The Richard Simmons Show drew thousands of exercise enthusiasts, including SAG/AFTRA actress Lucrecia Sarita Russo, who reportedly transported an entire bus filled with women from Pam\'s Figure Tique for a lively workout on the show.[citation needed]\n\nIn 1998, Simmons provided the voice of Boone in Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer: The Movie.\n\nHe featured as himself on numerous television series, including Whose Line Is It Anyway?, CHiPs, Saturday Night Live, The Larry Sanders Show, and in the Arrested Development episode ""Bringing Up Buster."" In 1999, he hosted the short-lived television series DreamMaker. In 2007, he filmed the PBS pledge drive special Love Yourself and Win.\n\nHe also featured in television advertisements for Sprint, Yoplait, and Herbal Essence Shampoos. In late 2007, he was in a ""This is SportsCenter"" commercial on ESPN as the show\'s ""conditioning coach"". In Canada, Simmons was in an advertisement for Simmons mattresses. The mattress company hired the exercise celebrity because of the similarity in name, and for his appeal to the company\'s target audience of women over 35.[citation needed] Beyond this, there is no further business partnership between the two.\n\nIn the Rocko\'s Modern Life episode ""No Pain, No Gain,"" Simmons voiced an exercise trainer bearing his animated likeness, leading a class filled with large anthropomorphic animals.\n\nFrom 2006 to 2008, he hosted a radio show on Sirius Stars (Sirius Satellite Radio channel 102) titled Lighten Up with Richard Simmons.[24][25]\n\nPersonal life [ edit ]\n\nSimmons in 2007\n\nPersonality [ edit ]\n\nSimmons uses his energetic and motivational demeanor to encourage people to lose weight. His high energy level is always featured in his workout videos. His trademark attire is candy-striped Dolphin shorts and tank tops decorated with Swarovski crystals.[15][32]\n\nSimmons interacts at a personal level with people using his products. This began by personally answering fan mail he received as a cast member of General Hospital. As of 2008, he personally answered emails and letters and made hundreds of phone calls each week to those seeking his help.[33][needs update]\n\nHe claimed to have few friends, saying, ""I don\'t have a lot to offer to one person. I have a lot to offer to a lot of people."" Aside from his three Dalmatians and two maids, Simmons lives alone in Beverly Hills, California.[33] While his sexual orientation has been the subject of much speculation, he never publicly discussed his sexuality.[34][35][36][37][38]\n\nIn a 2012 interview with Men\'s Health, he was quoted:\n\nWhen the king gets depressed, he doesn\'t call for his wife or the cook. He turns to the little man with the pointed hat and says to the court jester ""make me laugh"". And I am that court jester. Richard Simmons, Men\'s Health[39]\n\nHurricane Katrina response [ edit ]\n\nIn September 2005, Simmons appeared on Entertainment Tonight to discuss the effects of Hurricane Katrina on his family in his hometown of New Orleans, and his involvement in aiding those affected by the hurricane. On August 29, 2006, Simmons was on Your World with Neil Cavuto while making a return visit to New Orleans one year after the flooding, a visit he repeated on March 2, 2007, now talking about his recent trip to Washington, D.C., to promote and raise awareness about The Strengthening Physical Education Act of 2007 (H.R. 1224).[citation needed]\n\nRetreat from public life [ edit ]\n\nSimmons has not made any major public appearances since 2014 and stopped appearing in public altogether in February of that year. In March 2016, speculation began that he was being held hostage by his housekeeper.[3][4]\n\nIn response, on March 14, Simmons gave an audio interview on the Today Show, denying the rumors.[5] In November, the Simmons fitness gym closed, without any public announcement from Simmons.[20] In February 2017, the podcast Missing Richard Simmons launched, investigating why Simmons left public life so suddenly.[40]\n\nIn March 2017, LAPD detectives visited Simmons\' home to conduct a welfare check, issuing a statement that Simmons is ""perfectly fine"" and that ""right now he is doing what he wants to do and it is his business.""[41] On April 19, 2017, following a hospitalization for severe indigestion, Simmons made his first public comment in over a year, posting on Facebook a photo of himself and the message ""I\'m not \'missing\', just a little under the weather"".[42] However, the picture that was included in the post was from as far back as 2013, leading to speculation that the person who posted the message might not actually have been Simmons.[43][44][45]\n\nIn May 2017, he sued the National Enquirer, Radar Online, and American Media, Inc. for libel and false claims that he was undergoing gender reassignment.[46] In September 2017, Simmons lost the lawsuit, and was ordered to pay the defendants\' attorney\'s fees. The judge ruled that ""because courts have long held that a misidentification of certain immutable characteristics do not naturally tend to injure one\'s reputation, even if there is sizeable portion of the population who hold prejudices against those characteristics, misidentification of a person as transgender is not actionable defamation absent special damages.""[47][dead link]\n\nIn June 2018, he sued a Los Angeles private investigator, claiming he had placed a tracking device over a year earlier on the only vehicle Simmons used for transportation, noting that such tracking is in violation of California law.[48] In July 2018, Simmons amended the suit, alleging the investigator had been hired by In Touch Weekly, and prosecutors filed a criminal complaint.[49] In May 2020, a California appellate court upheld a trial judge\'s decision allowing Simmons\' lawsuit to move forward.[50]\n\nPrint and other media [ edit ]\n\nBooks [ edit ] Never Say Diet [51]\n\nNever Say Diet Cookbook [52]\n\nThe Better Body Book [53]\n\nDeal-A-Meal Cookbook [54]\n\nReach for Fitness: A Special Book of Exercises for the Physically Challenged [55]\n\nRichard Simmons\' Never Give Up: Inspirations, Reflections, Stories of Hope [56]\n\nFarewell to Fat [57]\n\nSweetie Pie: The Richard Simmons Private Collection of Dazzling Desserts [58]\n\nStill Hungry After All These Years: My Story [8]\n\nThe Food Mover Cookbook [59]\n\nCookin\' on Broadway [60]\n\nSteam Away the Pounds[61] Audio [ edit ] Analog compact cassette [ edit ] Project Me (six tape set) [62]\n\n(six tape set) Take a Walk [63]\n\nTake a Hike [64]\n\nSweatin\' and Sharin With Richard Simmons & Friends [65]\n\nWalk Across America [66]\n\nColors of Your Life (single tape) [67]\n\n(single tape) Colors of Your Life (six tape set) [68]\n\n(six tape set) Secrets of the Winners (single tape) [69]\n\n(single tape) Take a Classical Walk\n\nWalkin\' on Broadway\n\nWalk Around the World\n\nNever Give Up: Inspirations, Reflections, Stories of Hope (book on tape, read by Simmons)[70] Compact disc [ edit ] Richard Picks the Hits, Volume 1\n\nRichard Picks the Hits, Volume 2\n\nCountry Cardio\n\nOh Happy Day [71]\n\nFitness Fiesta\n\nWicked Workout [72]\n\nBig Screen Burn\n\nShimmy Into Shape\n\nIn the Mood to Lose\n\nClassical Chillout Vinyl record [ edit ] Reach (Elektra Records, 1982) - AUS #12[73] Singles [ edit ] This Time (Elektra Records, 45 rpm 1983) Digital compact cassette [ edit ] Colors of Your Life (single tape) (Goodtimes Entertainment, BASF 90 Min. 1998) Visual media [ edit ] DVD [ edit ] ""Richard Simmons Project H.O.P.E. - Health, Optimism, Passion, Energy""\n\nRichard Simmons and the Silver Foxes [74]\n\nDisco Sweat [75]\n\n60\'s Blast Off\n\n80\'s Blast Off\n\nBlast and Tone\n\nSuperSweatin\': Party Off the Pounds\n\nSuperTonin\': Totally Tonin\n\nSuperTonin\': Totally Tonin\' with Toning Rings\n\nSit Tight\n\nSweatin\' to the Oldies [76]\n\nSweatin\' to the Oldies 2 [77]\n\nSweatin\' to the Oldies 3 [78]\n\nSweatin\' to the Oldies 4 [79]\n\nSweatin\' to the Oldies 5 [80]\n\nLove Yourself and Win\n\nBoogie Down the Pounds\n\nTonin\' to the Oldies Video cassette [ edit ] Everyday with Richard Simmons\n\nThe Stomach Formula\n\nGet Started\n\nReach for Fitness - A Special Video of Exercises for the Physically Challenged [81]\n\nDeal Your Way to Health\n\nRichard Simmons and the Silver Foxes\n\nSweatin\' to the Oldies\n\nSweatin\' to the Oldies 2\n\nSweatin\' to the Oldies 3 [82]\n\nSweatin\' to the Oldies 4\n\nDay By Day (Volumes 1\xe2\x80\x9312)\n\n(Volumes 1\xe2\x80\x9312) Pump and Sweat\n\nStep and Sweat\n\nTone and Sweat\n\nFarewell to Fat [83]\n\nDisco Sweat\n\nStretchin\' to the Classics\n\nDance Your Pants Off!\n\nTonin\' Uptown\n\nTonin\' Downtown\n\nGroovin\' In The House\n\nThe Ab Formula\n\nNo Ifs Ands or Butts\n\nLove to Stretch\n\nBlast Off\n\nBroadway Sweat [84]\n\nTone Up On Broadway\n\nBroadway Blast Off\n\nPlatinum Sweat\n\nSit Tight\n\nLatin Blast Off (also marketed as Sudar Mucho )\n\n(also marketed as ) Mega Mix Blast Off\n\nMega Mix 2 Blast Off\n\nDisco Blast Off\n\n60\'s Blast Off\n\n80\'s Blast Off\n\nBlast and Tone YouTube [ edit ] Fit to Fly\n\nHair Do (Official Music Video)[85]\n\nNotes [ edit ]\n\nReferences [ edit ]'"

"b'Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- The next time a married man or woman glances your way, you might think twice before acting on impulse and frolicking between satin sheets. The scorned spouse could sue you.\n\nYes, you read that right. You, the paramour, can get hit with a lawsuit that could cost you hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n\nThey\'re known as ""alienation of affection"" suits, when an ""outsider"" interferes in a marriage. The suits are allowed in seven states: Hawaii, Illinois, Mississippi, New Mexico, North Carolina, South Dakota and Utah.\n\nThe law allowing such legal action dates back to antiquated times when a wife was considered the property of a husband. A broken-hearted hubby could go after his wife\'s lover -- not with a gun, but with the law.\n\nIn modern times, the suits are filed for two reasons: money and revenge. Juries in North Carolina have handed out awards in excess of $1 million on multiple occasions.\n\n""If your spouse is going to cheat, you really would like them to cheat with somebody who has a lot of money,"" says Lee Rosen, a North Carolina divorce attorney who deals with alienation of affection cases on a daily basis.\n\nAnd that\'s why many legal experts are paying close attention to the Tiger Woods saga. Will his wife go after an alleged mistress?\n\nWere any of his ""transgressions"" with someone who is married? If so, the jilted hubby might be able to go after the world\'s richest golfer.\n\nIt doesn\'t matter that Woods lives in Florida, a state where the suits aren\'t allowed, legal experts say. If any of Woods\' professed ""sins"" took place in an alienation of affection state, look out.\n\n""If he had been dating a married woman, there could be the potential for a lucrative recovery,"" Rosen says. ""You\'ve got to have a really affluent paramour that makes for a good target.""\n\nThe suits rarely make it to trial. Usually, just the threat of such a lawsuit is enough for an out-of-court settlement.\n\nClick through a gallery of famous sex scandals\n\n""When folks are getting divorced, the threat of having the person\'s new boyfriend, girlfriend, husband or wife dragged into court and the dirty laundry aired ... causes enormous pressure,"" says Matt Steffey, a law professor at Mississippi College School of Law.\n\nMississippi has been rocked by a high-profile suit, filed this summer, involving everything from allegations of ski resort trysts to a secret journal ordered kept under seal by a judge.\n\nBetter yet, it involves a congressman who once co-sponsored legislation for President George W. Bush to declare 2008 the ""National Year of the Bible.""\n\nThe son of a prominent federal judge in Mississippi, Chip Pickering was the rising GOP star of the state -- hand-picked to succeed Trent Lott in the U.S. Senate. Then, everything unraveled.\n\nPickering decided not to run for re-election in 2008 after 12 years in the House. At the time, he said he wanted to spend more time with his family. He\'s married with five children.\n\nLike a tale from William Faulkner, who penned many a book on Mississippi elite with personal flaws, Pickering\'s tumble has been staggering.\n\n""Chip Pickering has fallen far faster than the surrender of Vicksburg,"" Steffey says, referring to a key turning point in the Civil War, when Confederates gave up the Mississippi River town.\n\nThe real doozy came July 14, when Leisha Pickering filed the alienation of affection suit against her husband\'s alleged lover, a socialite named Elizabeth Creekmore-Byrd.\n\n""As a direct and proximate result of the negligent, wrongful and reckless misconduct and behavior of Creekmore-Byrd with Pickering,"" the suit says, ""plaintiff has suffered damage to the affection and consortium with her husband.""\n\nSo hush-hush is the case, lawyers on both sides have reached a confidential agreement to not discuss the case publicly.\n\nThe suit, in effect, has branded the once-proud congressman with a Scarlet ""A."" ""He had certainly fallen from the pinnacle of his professional life and his public life, but it had not yet become a public disgrace,"" Steffey says. ""And what this lawsuit did is it turned a fall into a disgrace.""\n\n""There\'s a particular cast of tragedy when people are undone, not by accidental misfortune, but by their own character defects.""\n\nWatch: Are men programmed to cheat?\n\nMost states have abolished alienation of affection lawsuits. Proponents in the holdout states say the threat of such legal action helps protect the sanctity of marriage.\n\nBut, Steffey and Rosen say, alienation of affection suits do just the opposite: They result in already contentious divorces getting even more heated, and they leave behind a public trail of personal shortcomings and wild tales of infidelity.\n\n""To allow these suits to go forward,"" Steffey says, ""is destructive to family life.""\n\n""It\'s much like dropping a nuclear bomb on a family,"" Rosen says. ""It really does damage the relationship between spouses. If there are children involved, it\'s devastating for them.""\n\nIt would require legislative action for states to change the law. And anyone who tries that in a conservative state could get painted as a pro-divorce lawmaker who holds cheaters less accountable.\n\n""It\'s a very delicate matter legislatively,"" Steffey says.\n\nAnd as long as the law remains on the books, Rosen says, he\'ll keep busy: ""We have an obligation to pursue our clients\' rights.""\n\nThere is one way to avoid such suits: Respect marital vows.'"

The two agreed to joint custody Sept. 15, PEOPLE confirmed \xe2\x80\x94 though at the time, Chyna\xe2\x80\x99s lawyer Lisa Bloom said the decision \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not resolve all disputes between Chyna and Rob.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo Rob and Chyna have officially broken up, but they obviously still have to communicate for the custody of Dream,\xe2\x80\x9d Khlo\xc3\xa9 says in the sneak peek. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re still having a hard time getting along. The legal battle that has been going on between the two of them has been super frustrating. I feel like this is escalating to a place that none of us could have ever imagined.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIn September, Rob and his sister Kylie Jenner, 20, sued Chyna for battery, assault and vandalism, alleging she attempted to choke Kardashian with an iPhone cord during a fight in December 2016. (Jenner owns the home where the alleged altercation took place.)\n\nIn the complaint, the siblings alleged Chyna made a \xe2\x80\x9cdeliberate attempt to extort the Kardashian family for her own monetary gains\xe2\x80\x9d and claimed her decision to have a baby with Rob was \xe2\x80\x9cnothing short of an outright fraud to shake down the Kardashian family.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIn October, Chyna filed her own lawsuit against her ex for allegedly damaging her brand and verbally and physically abusing her. In the filing obtained by PEOPLE, Chyna claims she has suffered \xe2\x80\x9csignificant damages\xe2\x80\x9d from his social media posts. She alleged the nude photo scandal \xe2\x80\x94 along with influence from the Kardashian family \xe2\x80\x94 are what got Rob & Chyna, her and Rob\xe2\x80\x99s E! reality show, axed before a season 2.\n\nShe also accused Rob of physical abuse, alleging that her ex once grabbed her phone out of her hand and \xe2\x80\x9cviolently knocked her to the ground where she landed on her hands and knees\xe2\x80\x9d after she tried to call Tyga, with whom she shares 5-year-old son King Cairo and who previously dated Jenner for almost three years.\n\nRob, who denies the assault claims, and his family have requested that the case be dismissed. According to court documents filed Dec. 27 in the Superior Court of Los Angeles and obtained by The Blast, Rob \xe2\x80\x9cgenerally and specifically denies each of the allegations\xe2\x80\x9d and claimed Chyna \xe2\x80\x9cdid not suffer any injury or harm as a result of any conduct by [Kardashian].\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIn a statement to PEOPLE in response, Chyna\xe2\x80\x99s attorney said, \xe2\x80\x9cWe are confident that we will prevail on this motion and at trial.\xe2\x80\x9d'"

"b""Life and death of Aaron Hernandez: 'There was so much anger'\n\nErik Brady | USA TODAY Sports\n\nShow Caption Hide Caption The rise and fall of Aaron Hernandez A look back on the talented player's NFL start and the series of events that ultimately resulted in his death.\n\nAaron Hernandez grew up in Bristol, Conn., home of ESPN, and he had the sort of athletic gifts that would lead one day to SportsCenter highlights and multi-million-dollar contracts to play for the darlings of his region, the New England Patriots.\n\nBut the boy from Bristol also harbored demons of the sort that would one day lead him to drugs, accusations of cold-blooded murder and, finally, his own death. Authorities said he hanged himself with a bed sheet early Wednesday in the prison cell where he was serving a life sentence without possibility of parole. He was 27 and had lived an operatic hybrid of American dream and ghastly nightmare. His death came the same day his former team visited the White House to celebrate their Super Bowl victory two months ago.\n\nHernandez caught a touchdown pass in the Super Bowl in early 2012 \xe2\x80\x93 and the next year found himself accused of killing a semipro football player, Odin Lloyd, who was dating the sister of Hernandez\xe2\x80\x99s fianc\xc3\xa9e. Motive remains unclear, though it may have been that Lloyd had some knowledge of Hernandez\xe2\x80\x99s link to a double homicide in the summer of 2012.\n\nLast week, Hernandez was acquitted of the most serious charges in that case, which would have only added to his life sentence because Massachusetts does not have the death penalty. Though, in the end, Hernandez apparently imposed his own.\n\nMORE COVERAGE:\n\nArmchair psychologists will long speculate what took Hernandez from a top target for Tim Tebow in college football to a top target for Tom Brady in the NFL and from there to a dark side of malevolent violence and unfathomable anger. Answers are ultimately unknowable but clues abound, beginning with the unexpected death of his father in 2006 when Hernandez was 16.\n\nDennis Hernandez was a high school custodian who died of complications arising from routine hernia surgery. The aftermath \xe2\x80\x9cwas a mess with a lot of family issues, fighting and disagreements,\xe2\x80\x9d Hernandez told USA TODAY Sports in 2009, when he was playing at Florida.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what to do for him,\xe2\x80\x9d his mother Terri said in the same story. \xe2\x80\x9cHe would rebel. It was very, very hard, and he was very, very angry. He wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the same kid, the way he spoke to me. The shock of losing his dad, there was so much anger.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTrouble 'finds this guy'\n\nHernandez was an honor student at Bristol Central High School, though Doug Pina, his high school coach, told the Hartford Courant in 2010 that he\xe2\x80\x99d personally \xe2\x80\x9calways had concerns\xe2\x80\x9d about him.\n\nHernandez had originally planned to play college football for Connecticut, where his father and older brother played, but changed his mind and chose Florida. Before his first college game, Hernandez, then 17, punched a restaurant manager in the side of the head, busting his eardrum in a dispute over the bill. The case apparently settled out of court.\n\nHernandez also was among several Gators players interviewed by police after a shooting at a nightclub that left two men wounded. No one was ever charged.\n\nHernandez won a national championship and the John Mackey Award for the nation\xe2\x80\x99s best tight end during his time at Florida. He declared for the 2010 NFL draft where the Patriots took him in the fourth round, lower than his talent suggested he\xe2\x80\x99d go, apparently because of multiple failed drug tests and unsavory friends. CBSSports.com quoted an unnamed NFL scout: \xe2\x80\x9cWe stayed away because we hated the people he hung out with and how trouble always finds this guy.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMORE COVERAGE:\n\nPublished reports at the time said Hernandez had told teams at the NFL scouting combine that he\xe2\x80\x99d begun using marijuana to cope with the death of his father.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho do I talk to?\xe2\x80\x9d Hernandez said of the uncertainty after his father\xe2\x80\x99s death in that 2009 USA TODAY Sports story. \xe2\x80\x9cWho do I hang with?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe often hung with a bad crowd in years to come, including Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz. Rolling Stone styled them as \xe2\x80\x9ctwo stumble-bum crooks with long sheets of priors.\xe2\x80\x9d Wallace and Ortiz were with Hernandez when Lloyd was killed near Hernandez\xe2\x80\x99s Massachusetts home in 2013.\n\nFamily relationships were often complicated. Hernandez\xe2\x80\x99s cousin Tanya married Jeffrey Cummings in 2005; they had a son together and got divorced. Then, in 2009, Cummings married Hernandez\xe2\x80\x99s mother on a trip to Las Vegas. A year later, about a month before Hernandez reported to his first Patriots\xe2\x80\x99 training camp, Cummings slashed Hernandez\xe2\x80\x99s mother with a knife and she had lacerations to her face, shoulder and wrist. Cummings would wind up in jail and they would divorce.\n\nHernandez married Shayanna Jenkins in 2012 in the same month their daughter was born. That came only months after two Cape Verdean immigrants were gunned down in their car drive-by style after one of them bumped into Hernandez at a nightclub and spilled his drink.\n\nAlexander Bradley would say at trial that it was Hernandez who shot Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado \xe2\x80\x93 and Hernandez\xe2\x80\x99s lawyers would say it was Bradley who shot them. Bradley, not incidentally, had filed a civil suit in 2013 alleging that Hernandez shot him point-blank in the face months earlier, costing him his right eye. They were best friends before they were mortal enemies.\n\nTattoos tell story\n\nLast week, Hernandez wept after he was acquitted. It seemed out of character for a man who so often seemed devoid of any emotion. Reports at the time of his father\xe2\x80\x99s funeral said that Hernandez didn\xe2\x80\x99t cry, even as his brother and so many others did.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere was such hunger in that kid for a father\xe2\x80\x99s hand, and such greatness itching to get out,\xe2\x80\x9d Rolling Stone\xe2\x80\x99s story said after Hernandez\xe2\x80\x99s arrest in 2013, \xe2\x80\x9cthat coach after coach had covered for him whenever the bad Aaron showed \xe2\x80\x94 the violent, furious kid who was dangerous to all, most particularly, it seems, to his friends.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nKelly Whiteside wrote in her 2009 story in USA TODAY Sports that a guided tour of the tattoos on Hernandez\xe2\x80\x99s body reads like his autobiography.\n\nStarting from his right shoulder, she wrote, \xe2\x80\x9cthere was a tattoo representing God\xe2\x80\x99s hands, a nod to his big brother and to his father and the day he died. There\xe2\x80\x99s the sun representing all the good days he had with his dad. Beneath those rays are clouds and rain.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHernandez then pointed to the angels near his wrist. \xe2\x80\x9cIt all ends in heaven,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\nHe\xe2\x80\x99d add more tattoos in the years ahead. One was of a smoking semi-automatic pistol. Another was of a six-shot revolver. That one accompanies two words, written in reverse: \xe2\x80\x9cGod Forgives.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPHOTOS: Aaron Hernandez's life"""

While that photo was shared without a word to mark the memory, Michele recently took to the stage to share a few songs that seemed to have given even greater tribute to Monteith and Lea\xe2\x80\x99s relationship with the late actor.\n\nGlee Alum Lea Michele Shares Another Photo Of Corey Monteith And Herself\n\nA photo posted by Lea Michele (@leamichele) on Jan 23, 2017 at 11:04am PST\n\nBillboard shares that Corey Monteith was on Lea\xe2\x80\x99s mind even more so than usual this past week, as the Glee and Scream Queens star took an opportunity to share another photo from her collection. This time, the picture looked more candid and spur of the moment, taken long before Instagram. The image of Michele and Monteith was seems to be an older picture, taken in the days of the Polaroid Instant Camera, though, considering Lea posted many similar images, it may be possible that she was making use of a new app or filter.\n\nThe picture of Lea and Corey shows Ms. Michele snuggling close to her Glee co-star, as Monteith wraps his arms around her in a protective embrace. While the Glee actress didn\xe2\x80\x99t caption this image, the photo seems to speak for itself, alluding to their relationship as it was then. It also speaks to Michele\xe2\x80\x99s state of heart now, remembering Corey after his passing.\n\nWhile the Instagram posting\xe2\x80\x99s caption is blank, Ms. Michele\xe2\x80\x99s handwriting on the white portion of the Polaroid picture indicates that the photo was taken on New York City\xe2\x80\x99s Bleeker Street, sometime in 2012.\n\nLea Michele Remembers Corey Monteith In Song With \xe2\x80\x9cGetaway Car\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nE! News shares that Lea Michele has been keeping her vocal chords in shape by pursuing her singing interests at Los Angeles\xe2\x80\x99 The Hotel Caf\xc3\xa9, where Michele\xe2\x80\x99s song set seemed to have a theme. The intimate venue gave fans a more personal experience with Lea, as she sang songs such as \xe2\x80\x9cTo Make You Feel My Love\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cMy Man.\xe2\x80\x9d While the Glee star didn\xe2\x80\x99t mention Corey Monteith by name, it seemed apparent that the romantic theme of the songs was directed at her late lover.\n\nOne song in particular, \xe2\x80\x9cGetaway Car,\xe2\x80\x9d seemed to be a very specifically honoring of Lea\xe2\x80\x99s relationship with Monteith.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe used to just get in the car and drive sometimes. Me and the tall guy and it was like our getaway and it was so great,\xe2\x80\x9d Ms. Michele said, introducing the song. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know, and everything was getting big and popular with Glee and it was sort of our escape. So this next song is called \xe2\x80\x98Getaway Car\xe2\x80\x99 and its having that moment in the car.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPreviously, Lea Michele shared a very poignant image of Corey with the late actor walking away from the camera and towards the deep blue ocean.

"b'Bravo\n\nThings got messy on Wednesday\'s ""Real Housewives of New York,"" and it wasn\'t just because the ladies participated in a murder mystery held at Dorinda Medley\'s Berkshires home.\n\nPrior to the Berkshires rendezvous, Dorinda and Ramona Singer told Carole Radziwill that her once-BFF, Bethenny Frankel, felt some type of way after Carole\'s then-boyfriend, Adam, asked for compensation when Bethenny invited him to Puerto Rico with her relief team to photograph the hurricane aftermath. Bethenny felt Adam shouldn\'t have asked to be paid to work a charity event and told Dorinda she was offended. Dorinda then relayed the message to Carole, who was ""shocked"" because Bethenny had made no mention of it to her.\n\nDuring the murder mystery dinner, Bethenny called out Ramona for telling Carole that Bethenny had called her a ""puppet."" Bethenny was adamant that she never used that word (she didn\'t, but what she did say was not far off), and Carole said she believed her. Case closed, right? Wrong. In walks Dorinda.\n\n""Don\'t get mad,"" Dorinda said as she stared at Bethenny and Carole. ""Do you think you two have tension? We all feel it. Group, support me here. I\'m the only brave one who said it.""\n\nBethenny said she didn\'t feel tense, but Carole did not reciprocate.\n\n""I mean, I feel our vibe is off a little bit,"" she said. ""We\'re a little disconnected.""\n\nBethenny agreed there had been a ""shift.""\n\n""Is there a reason for it?"" Carole asked. ""Because I\'m feeling like there has been a shift, and I don\'t understand the reason.""\n\nBethenny and Carole agreed they\'d discuss the issue at a later time, but Dorinda insisted: ""Let\'s get it out on the table."" Dammit, Dorinda!\n\n""If you have a problem with me--"" Carole said.\n\n""I don\'t have a problem with you,"" Bethenny replied.\n\n""Not from what I heard last night,"" Carole fired back. ""I heard that you were either upset with me over something having to do with Adam not working for your charity for free, or you are upset with me and my level of financial support for your charity.""\n\n""I didn\'t ask for more of a financial support,"" Bethenny replied. ""I don\'t need any support from you for the charity. You haven\'t asked me about it once. Never. Over the summer, we didn\'t talk about it at all.""\n\nCarole denied that she never showed interest. She then brought up that Page Six had contacted her about a rumored feud going on between her and Bethenny. Carole said she shut the story down and revealed in front of everyone that Bethenny told her it was Dorinda who leaked it to the gossip site.\n\nBethenny was furious.\n\nThen the Adam issue came up, and a screaming match ensued. Carole told her side of the Adam situation and said Bethenny was lying.\n\n""Oh, my God, Carole!"" Bethenny said. ""You\'re freaking me out right now.""\n\n""Does the truth freak you out?"" Carole asked before calling Bethenny ""honey."" Wrong move, Carole.\n\nThe screaming match continued -- and will continue on next week\'s episode.'"

"b'Even before FX\xe2\x80\x99s Feud premiered, series creator Ryan Murphy teased how the mini-series would end for Joan Crawford and Bette Davis, the beleaguered Hollywood legends played by Jessica Lange and Susan Sarandon.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have always had a wistful dream that Bette and Joan could have watched this [show] together,\xe2\x80\x9d Murphy told Vanity Fair of the star-crossed friends. \xe2\x80\x9cI think that my favorite line from What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? is at the end of the film, when Jane tells Blanche, just as she is dying, \xe2\x80\x98You mean all this time, we could have been friends?\xe2\x80\x99 To me, that\xe2\x80\x99s what the whole show is about.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMurphy was so serious about the sentiment that he used it for the title of his finale: \xe2\x80\x9cYou Mean All This Time We Could Have Been Friends?\xe2\x80\x9d And, as he hinted he might, Murphy found a way to reimagine a better outcome for his protagonists. Crawford, nearing the end of her days in her high-rise Manhattan apartment, hallucinates a brilliant fantasy sequence in which she walks into her living room to find Jack Warner (Stanley Tucci), Hedda Hopper (Judy Davis), and Davis. Warner and Hopper\xe2\x80\x94the forces who willed the stars\xe2\x80\x99 great rivalry into existence, for good publicity and better copy\xe2\x80\x94part, and Crawford sits alone with Davis.\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s tender, cathartic, and tragic to see these two Hollywood titans put their vulnerability and ego aside to connect. The sad irony of the fantasy, though, is that in the loneliness of these women\xe2\x80\x99s final years, they never realized how much they truly had in common. They were strong women who battled the studio system to build long-lasting careers, only to be tossed aside as talk-show punchlines the moment the industry decided their expiration date was up. They focused so intently on their careers that they never had truly satisfying relationships with family or friends, and would go on to become the subjects of vengeful memoirs from their ungrateful daughters. And they would cope with the despair of their dwindling careers\xe2\x80\x94and in turn, their crumbling identities\xe2\x80\x94in the same way: by becoming alcoholic recluses fixated on the past.\n\nIn the finale, Murphy allows for another fantasy for the duo by showing Davis dialing Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s number after hearing that her What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? co-star is sick. But Davis cannot bring herself to speak into the receiver\xe2\x80\x94one final missed opportunity at what could have been a meaningful friendship. In a real-life interview, though, Davis\xe2\x80\x99s daughter, B.D., explained why she thought her mother never thawed her iciness toward Crawford.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMother felt they had nothing in common,\xe2\x80\x9d B.D. said, according to Shaun Considine\xe2\x80\x99s The Divine Feud. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd at that time she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be friends with herself. She was full of self-pity and hatred.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWithout a lifeline from Davis or anyone else in Hollywood, Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s final years were actually even sadder than they are as depicted on Murphy\xe2\x80\x99s Feud finale.\n\nThe Oscar-winning actress closed out her acting career in 1970 with the sci-fi abomination Trog. In 1973, Pepsi forced Crawford into retirement as the company\xe2\x80\x99s spokeswoman\xe2\x80\x94a news flash the actress said she learned by reading the financial pages of The New York Times. The severed relationship meant that the actress no longer received her \xe2\x80\x9cforty-thousand-dollar expenses, her car, her New York secretary, and the use of the company jet,\xe2\x80\x9d according to The Divine Feud. To compensate, the actress moved to a smaller apartment in her building and streamlined her once grand lifestyle.\n\nThe final blow to Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s ego came the following year\xe2\x80\x94as shown on Feud\xe2\x80\x94when she was photographed unflatteringly outside a book party she co-hosted for John Springer. Crawford was so \xe2\x80\x9chorrified\xe2\x80\x9d by the photos published in the newspaper the next day that she told biographer Charlotte Chandler she imposed her own exile.

Instead, she fired back at the latter, saying, ""He can manipulate your boyfriend into firing you off his movie, but no don\'t worry about him he\'s not your problem.""\n\nAnd that, for Shaun, was the last straw as she told Hope: ""How can you even just sit here and act like you\'re the one who has Megan\'s back. What did you just forget about what you did?""\n\nShaun then told Megan that it was Hope who had given her naked photos to the media outlets. Hope then tried to persuade Megan to forgive her and that she only did that to teach her a lesson.\n\nHope had wanted to convince Megan that Kyle, Terence, and anyone from the Institute for the Higher Mind was no good for her but she grew upset with how Megan kept on ignoring her. Hope thought that giving Megan a headache such as a naked photo scandal would bring her closer.\n\nUnfortunately for Hope, it was friendship over for Megan as the latter said, ""I can\'t have you in my life.""\n\n""The Arrangement"" airs on Sundays at 10 p.m. EDT on E!\n\nFree CP Newsletters Join over 250,000 others to get the top stories curated daily, plus special offers!

"b'IT\xe2\x80\x99S been almost five months since the WWE universe learnt of the shock death of the biggest female star in wrestling history, Chyna.\n\nThe woman dubbed the \xe2\x80\x9cNinth Wonder of the World\xe2\x80\x9d, real name Joanie Laurer, was found dead at her home in Redondo Beach, California, believed to be the victim of an accidental overdose of prescription drugs. She was 46.\n\nA new feature on the worldwide star by Bleacher Report\xe2\x80\x99s Jason King traces her stunning fall from grace back to her decision to walk away from a lucrative WWE contract at the height of her fame.\n\nKing\xe2\x80\x99s feature documents the troubled childhood Chyna was able to overcome to attain fame on a level few in the wrestling game have ever achieved.\n\nShe was earning seven figures a year around the turn of the century, had graced the cover of Playboy magazine, was appearing on late-night talk shows and had a best-selling autobiography.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe felt like she\xe2\x80\x99d really made it,\xe2\x80\x9d Chyna\xe2\x80\x99s sister, Kathy, told Bleacher Report. \xe2\x80\x9cShe loved being treated like a rock star.\xe2\x80\x9d But it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t last.\n\nTHE BEGINNING\n\nLaurer, who was billed as a six-foot powerhouse who could benchpress more than 140kg, debuted in Vince McMahon\xe2\x80\x99s promotion as a bodyguard for Paul \xe2\x80\x9cTriple H\xe2\x80\x9d Levesque in February, 1997.\n\nShe would often help the rising male star win through nefarious methods like delivering low blows to the groin of his opponents, but soon became a wrestling standout in her own right.\n\nChyna\xe2\x80\x99s star power and undoubted talent allowed her to go where no female wrestler had been before. After initial reluctance, male counterparts became willing to let her overpower them and in January, 1999, she became the first woman to ever take part in the Royal Rumble.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShattered glass ceilings, kicked down doors, broke gender barriers,\xe2\x80\x9d fellow female star Trish Status tweeted after Chyna\xe2\x80\x99s death. \xe2\x80\x9cShe was an anomaly and untouchable.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nOffstage her life was flourishing too. A bit of a loner growing up who found solace in the gym, Chyna found a family in the WWE ranks \xe2\x80\x94 and a boyfriend in Triple H.\n\nThe pair were inseparable on the road, bonding over their dedication to a healthy lifestyle, a love of lifting weights and a determination to plot their way to the top of the wrestling world.\n\nTHE BREAKING POINT\n\nThe Bleacher Report feature reveals Chyna and Triple H\xe2\x80\x99s relationship began to deteriorate around 2000. \xe2\x80\x9cFriends say Levesque wanted children; Laurer did not,\xe2\x80\x9d King reported. \xe2\x80\x9cShe was also jealous of the time Levesque spent with his parents and siblings during the rare days the WWE wasn\xe2\x80\x99t on the road.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen she sensed Levesque was growing closer with Stephanie McMahon \xe2\x80\x94 the boss\xe2\x80\x99 daughter, whom he later married in 2003 \xe2\x80\x94 Laurer was crushed, telling numerous friends she\xe2\x80\x99d searched Levesque\xe2\x80\x99s briefcase and discovered a love letter from Stephanie.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWhether a broken heart contributed to Chyna\xe2\x80\x99s decision to play hardball with WWE management over her next contract is up for debate. But the company claimed her outrageous base salary demand \xe2\x80\x94 according to Bleacher Report she refused to accept anything less than a starting point of $1 million after being offered $400,000 \xe2\x80\x94 was the reason for her 2001 exit.\n\nBut in several interviews over the ensuing years, Chyna claimed she was forced out \xe2\x80\x94 largely because of Stephanie\xe2\x80\x99s affection for Triple H.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe basically said that Paul was hers and I just had to deal with it,\xe2\x80\x9d Chyna said, in a series of posts she made on Twitter in 2012 that were compiled by wrestlingnewsworld.com. \xe2\x80\x9cI said that she was lucky her father was there or I would of ripped her face off. Vince said to go home and take some time off and then we will deal with it. I was near the end of my contract.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo basically, he never re-signed me. He chose his daughter\xe2\x80\x99s happiness over his talent and maybe he should have. But this was business. Even if he didn\xe2\x80\x99t want me on the show anymore because of the two of them, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t of been a trainer of up and coming talent? I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t of done something else within WWE where I never would have had to run into or deal with Stephanie?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut her sister told Bleacher Report Chyna privately regretted her own role in the breakdown. \xe2\x80\x9cJoanie told me a few years later that she regretted it,\xe2\x80\x9d Kathy said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe WWE was the only place where she was ever accepted. Once she lost that, she fell into a hole. And she never could climb out of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTHE DOWNFALL\n\nAfter she left pro wrestling Chyna\xe2\x80\x99s life seemingly lurched from one crisis to the next. She developed a crystal meth habit and began a relationship with another wrestler Sean \xe2\x80\x9cX-Pac\xe2\x80\x9d Waltman, which was damaging to both parties.\n\nThey combined in the infamous pornographic film 1 Night in China, a venture which led to Chyna embarking on a career in the adult film industry. \xe2\x80\x9cThat tape happened to me. It was done to me,\xe2\x80\x9d Laurer told thedailybeast.com in 2011. \xe2\x80\x9cIt traumatised me. When that came out, I felt really duped. That was life-changing in a really negative way.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nChyna battled mental illness, attempted suicide and despite rehabilitation attempts \xe2\x80\x94 both in America and Japan \xe2\x80\x94 was never able to silence the demons inside her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll I kept thinking after she died was that poor girl,\xe2\x80\x9d her sister told Bleacher Report. \xe2\x80\x9cShe wanted so badly to be loved and accepted, but she never had a loving, connective relationship with anyone. People just used her and sucked her dry ... At least she\xe2\x80\x99s at peace now. At least she\xe2\x80\x99s at peace.\xe2\x80\x9d'"

"b""A new book about Prince's life written by his ex-wife Mayte Garcia details how the pair's relationship fell apart in 1996 after the loss of their first child just days after his birth.\n\nThat was just the beginning of Mayte's heartache however, as a little over one year later she lost her second children when she miscarried on the first day of her second trimester.\n\nMayte writes in her book 'The Most Beautiful' that she was devastated when the doctor told her the news, but also relieved that unlike her first son Amiir this baby would not be born into the world and have to experience days of pain before his death.\n\nHer husband meanwhile acted distant and ignored her when she told him, reveals Mayte, who decided to go spend some time with her mother so she could have some compassion during her time of grief.\n\nScroll down for video\n\nThe way they were: Mayte Garcia writes about how Prince responded to the news that she had miscarried in her new book about the singer, 'The Most Beautiful' (pictured in April 1997)\n\nBaby joy: Back in the day: Mayte became pregnant in August 1997 with the couple's second child (Mayte above in Times Square on Tuesday)\n\nShe then told Prince over a week later that she was still bleeding heavily and growing increasingly concerned, so she had spoke with a doctor who had said she needed to go in and have a procedure done to remove the lining of her uterus.\n\nThat is when the singer, who had converted and become a Jehovah's Witness after the death of the couple's first son, informed his wife that she would not be getting the procedure.\n\nThis despite the fact that Mayte's own life was at risk.\n\nMayte writes that the first trimester of her pregnancy had been going great, and that she felt good and all signs were pointing toward a healthy baby.\n\nShe wanted to wait however to share the good news, given that in October of the previous year she and Prince had lost their son.\n\nShe eagerly waited until November 19, the day when she could finally share the good news and go in and get an ultrasound and hear her baby's heartbeat.\n\nWhen the day came however, it was nothing like what she had been imagining and hoping for over the previous three months.\n\n'I went into the bathroom and found blood seeping out of me. It felt like a long walk to the telephone,' writes Garcia.\n\nShe called up her husband to let him know what was happening before she left to go have the check-up that had already been scheduled for the day.\n\nHe said nothing, voiced no concern and did not even volunteer to accompany his wife.\n\nOnce she got to the doctors and had her ultrasound the bad news was confirmed, there was no heartbeat.\n\nThen, the 24-year-old had to tell her husband, 39, that their child was gone.\n\nMayte said she had to gather herself before she could even face Prince, and that when he saw her sobbing and heard the news he said: 'I need to go to the studio.'\n\nHe then turned and walk off, while Mayte went to her mother's home.\n\nAll about Prince: Mayte kept the news of her second preganncy a secret from everyone but her husband and made an appointment to get an ultrasound and hear the heartbeat on November 19 (Mayte above on GMA Tuesday with her book)\n\nTough time: Mayte learned that she had lost her baby on the very first day of her second trimester (Mayte performs onstage with Prince in 1991 during a concert in New York City)\n\nWhen she returned home she told Prince that she had been bleeding for days and would be going in to have a dilation and curettage to stop the flow, with her doctor concerned she could hemorrhage and possibly lose her life if she did not undergo the procedure.\n\n'Nature will take it's course if you let it,' said Prince according to Mayte. 'Either we have faith or we don't.'\n\nMayte refused to listed and went in to have the procedure, with Prince refusing to come with his young wife for the difficult appointment.\n\n'I'm not going to risk my fertility for something I don't believe in,' said Mayte, referring to Prince's newfound faith.\n\n'I'm going to do what the doctors say. I'm going to the hospital.'\n\nShe then begged Prince to come but he would not budge.\n\n'I don't believe in what you're doing,' he told his wife.\n\nHe had his limo driver take her to the hospital, and Mayte writes that as she lay there she though to herself: 'I'm just a birthday-loving pagan. And there's nothing wrong with that.'\n\nCruel: 'I have to go to the studio,' responded Prince, who then left the house and his 24-year-old wife, after she revealed she had suffered a miscarriage (left in 1993, right in 1995)\n\nBeginning of the end: Mayte said that the pair's relationship began to crumble after the loss of their first son and her undercarriage\n\nMayte writes in the book that just one year earlier the couple was bursting with joy when she gave birth to their son Amiir on October 16, 1996 after years of trying to have a child.\n\nThat changed in almost an instant however when the pair soon learned that the boy had a rare genetic disorder, Pfeiffer syndrome type 2.\n\n'I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how to describe the look on my husband\xe2\x80\x99s face. Pure joy,' writes Garcia about those first moments after the birth.\n\n'And then they held the baby up to those harsh lights. The elation on my husband\xe2\x80\x99s face turned to pure terror.'\n\nAmiir died just six days later, with Garcia writing that towards the end it became too difficult for the boy to even breathe.\n\nShe was sent home on the day her son died and sleeping when he passed, with prince refusing to wake her up to see her boy one last time she writes in the book.\n\nMayte then took to her bed for days, laying there while cradling her son's ashes.\n\nPrince meanwhile fled their home one day after the couple received their son's urn.\n\n'The Most Beautiful' is on bookshelves now."""
"b'We don\xe2\x80\x99t have to tell you, because you already know: There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing in the world like a fresh blowout. We\xe2\x80\x99d love to make it last for days, even weeks, if we could, but the truth is that a perfectly coiffed style just doesn\xe2\x80\x99t look quite the same after a day or two. We always want to make the most of our blowouts, which raises the question\xe2\x80\x94how can we maintain those bold curls and sexy waves for as long as possible? With the right sleep strategies, that\xe2\x80\x99s how.\n\nFirst things first: Sleep smart.\n\nOpt for a silk pillowcase over a cotton one\xe2\x80\x94the silk allows hair to gently slide around throughout the night, while a cotton fabric creates friction between the hair and the case. \xe2\x80\x9cSome of my clients love using silk scarves and wrapping them around a bun for bed,\xe2\x80\x9d says Giovanni Vaccaro, creative director for GLAMSQUAD. This is a great way to make the blowout last, but the placement of the bun is key. For very thick, coarse hair, a low tight bun is your best option in order to minimize puffiness and keep hair smooth, Vaccaro says. For finer strands, gather hair in a very loose top bun. Never use regular bobby pins or clips, as these usually leave marks, and make sure the bun is loose enough so the hair can maintain its volume and bounce.\n\nBraid your beach waves.\n\nBeachy waves are a blowout bar favorite, but how do you maintain that style after you take it out on the town? Michael Braun, PRIV hair stylist, says to braid vertical sections going around your head according to your part before bed to protect the style and add fun texture. Just unbraid and shake \xe2\x80\x98em out in the morning.\n\nKeep your curls intact.\n\nFirstly, flip your head upside down and lightly finger comb through your hair to make sure you don\xe2\x80\x99t have any knots. Gather all of your hair to the highest point of your head into a pony and secure loosely with a hair tie. Be careful not to tighten the hair tie, or it will create an unwanted crease, says DreamDry Senior Stylist Sonia David. Roll the hair into the direction of your curls and secure each curl with a hair pin. Follow by wrapping your hair with a silk scarf to keep it smooth overnight.\n\nPreserve your sleekness.\n\nBecause of its simplicity, a sleek, straight look is the easiest blowout style to maintain, provided you treat it with the necessary care. Braun suggests wrapping your hair around your head, then using roller pins to pin in place and a silk scarf to protect it.\n\nMake your soft waves stay.\n\nSoft, sexy red carpet waves are super fun to wear for a night out, but they\xe2\x80\x99re especially difficult to maintain on day two. Braun says to section hair into four sections\xe2\x80\x94two in the front, two in the back\xe2\x80\x94and create a bun out of each section at night to hold style. You\xe2\x80\x99ll look fairly ridiculous, but if maintaining a flawless blowout is something you hold in high esteem, then it\xe2\x80\x99ll be totally worth it.\n\nRead more: 5 Weird Ways to Protect Your Blowout'"

"b'Answer: J.K. Rowling\n\nTo say the Harry Potter book series and ensuing movie, toy, and general marketing franchise took the world by storm would be an understatement of enormous proportions.\n\nThe novels, seven in all released between 1997 and 2007, have sold over 400 million copies across 67 languages. That alone would have brought great wealth to their author, J.K. Rowling, but the ensuing related merchandise and film franchise pushed the value of the Harry Potter brand to over $15 billion.\n\nMore than a little bit of that wealth found its way back to J. K. Rowling who, in the process, became the world\xe2\x80\x99s first person to become a billionaire by way of their fiction writing career. Her stint as a billionaire didn\xe2\x80\x99t last for long though; between the high tax rate in the UK and Rowling\xe2\x80\x99s donation of so much money to charity, she quickly lost her status as a billionaire.'"
"b""The Fast and the Furious franchise has changed quite a bit since it launched in 2001, morphing into movies revolving around street races and heists to its protagonists now often working to save the world. But along with cars, one of the constants in this film series has been action, and with Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham being the stars of Hobbs and Shaw, you need to double down on that particular element. Hiring David Leitch as director is a good step towards ensuring that happens, as he has plenty of experience with stunt-driven action both in front of and behind the camera. While it's reasonable to assume that driving/racing will still factor into this spinoff, given that Luke Hobbs and Deckard Shaw are two of the best fighters among the main Fast and the Furious characters, one would imagine that means there will be even more throwing down of fisticuffs compared to the main series entries."""

Her death was first reported by TMZ.\n\nNo cause of death has been determined.\n\nMoran, who was born Oct. 18, 1960, in Burbank, Calif., landed her first big role on the children\'s adventure show Daktari when she was just 8. The show premiered the same year she made her film debut opposite Debbie Reynolds in How Sweet It Is.\n\nShe occupied herself with TV work until she landed the role of the youngest child of the Cunningham family. The series, which took place between 1955 and 1965, premiered on ABC in 1974. She left to star in its spinoff, Joanie Loves Chachi, but that show was canceled after one season. She rejoined the Happy Days cast for its final season, which ended in 1984.\n\nHer post-Happy Days credits include guest stints on The Love Boat and Murder, She Wrote.\n\nMoran also jumped on the reality TV bandwagon, doing a season of VH1\'s weight-loss show Celebrity Fit Club in 2008.\n\nHer most recent acting credit was 2010\'s Not Another B Movie.\n\nShe was back in the headlines a year later, when she joined several other members of the Happy Days supporting cast in suing CBS, the studio that produced Happy Days, for withholding royalty money they were entitled to under their contracts. In 2012, each of them won a $65,000 settlement and the rights to future royalties.\n\nIt was a welcome infusion of cash for Moran, who had only a handful of acting gigs in the last 25 years according to IMDb.com, and was said to be living in an Indiana trailer park and struggling with personal issues.\n\nRon Howard, who played Richie, her big brother on Happy Days, tweeted, ""I will always choose to remember you on our show making scenes better, getting laughs and lighting up TV screens.""\n\nSuch sad sad news.

"b'Ryan Murphy has long been on a crusade to champion older female actresses. His muses of late are venerable stars like Jessica Lange, Kathy Bates, and Angela Bassett, among others\xe2\x80\x94gifted performers who have seen their options in Hollywood largely dry up over the years. That simply won\xe2\x80\x99t do for Murphy. And his latest series, Feud\xe2\x80\x94the behind-the-scenes story of Bette Davis and Joan Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s legendary rivalry\xe2\x80\x94has given Murphy the perfect vehicle to ramp up his crusade, particularly when it comes to sexualizing older female actresses on-screen.\n\nIn an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Murphy discusses that particular urge, explaining why (spoiler alert!) he really wanted to include a sex scene between Davis (played by Susan Sarandon) and What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? director Robert Aldrich (Alfred Molina) in the last episode. Both Davis and Crawford were in their 50s when they filmed this movie, at an age where older female actresses are \xe2\x80\x9cno longer sexualized,\xe2\x80\x9d Murphy said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was important to me and to Jessica and Susan to show that side of Bette and Joan,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued. \xe2\x80\x9cThey were sexual in that they did have romances, they did sleep with men in their 50s. They weren\xe2\x80\x99t just actresses and mothers, they had a completely other thing going on, as everybody does.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe and his lead actresses \xe2\x80\x9cspent a lot of time\xe2\x80\x9d discussing Bette and Joan\xe2\x80\x99s sexual lives (which were famously voracious), and were determined to document them. In fact, after Davis wrapped Baby Jane, she had an affair with an actor in his 20s while filming Hush . . . Hush, Sweet Charlotte, Murphy told the Reporter. \xe2\x80\x9cNobody ever thought of that of Bette Davis, but that\xe2\x80\x99s who she was and how she acted. I love that she lived her life unapologetically as a man would and I wanted to show that.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBefore Murphy became FX\xe2\x80\x99s in-house TV auteur, he was an entertainment journalist who actually got to spend time with Davis, which informed the way he shaped her character in Feud: \xe2\x80\x9cI got to ask her these questions [about her rivalry with Crawford]\xe2\x80\x94I did reporting many years ago, and it was never published.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMurphy\xe2\x80\x99s determination to champion older actresses also comes from his personal experience and friendships with older stars. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve grown up with many women in my career now, all of whom come into my office and sometimes break down in tears, saying suddenly the phone has stopped ringing. \xe2\x80\x98Suddenly people aren\xe2\x80\x99t interested in me anymore just because I got older.\xe2\x80\x99 And I\xe2\x80\x99m very moved by that,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cPersevering and fighting to stay in the game instead of giving up and still fighting to demonstrate your self worth is tremendously moving.

"b'Kim Zolciak-Biermann and Kroy Biermann want dog owners to know the signs to look out for if their pets are being aggressive\n\nKim Zolciak-Biermann and Kroy Biermann want dog owners to know the signs to look out for if their pets are being aggressive.\n\nThe couple, who have been married since 2011, faced the nightmare of their lives on April 22, when their dog Sinn bit their 5-year-old son Kash, nearly blinding him.\n\nGet push notifications with news, features and more.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was a like a bad dream,\xe2\x80\x9d Kim, 39, tells PEOPLE exclusively of the bite, which left Kash in the hospital for 4 days, the scratch a millimeter away from his eye. \xe2\x80\x9cOur dog Sinn is heavily, heavily trained. Kash is his favorite. It made absolutely no sense to any of us. This is nothing I ever thought I\xe2\x80\x99d be dealing with in my life.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThough Kim shared news about the bite on social media after it happened, much of the details surrounding the incident have been unknown until now \xe2\x80\x94 including the fact that Sinn was the one who bit Kash. The two were playing outside alongside the Biermanns\xe2\x80\x99 other son KJ, 6, when Kroy was using a leaf blower to clean the yard.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSinn doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like the blower, so he\xe2\x80\x99s already in high alert,\xe2\x80\x9d Kroy, 32, says on Friday\xe2\x80\x99s episode of Don\xe2\x80\x99t Be Tardy, which documents the aftermath of Sinn\xe2\x80\x99s bite. \xe2\x80\x9cMy back was to the dogs and the boys. I hear Kash be loud, and then I hear barking. And then I hear Kash screaming, he\xe2\x80\x99s crying very loud. At that point I think he\xe2\x80\x99s scared, but then I realize Sinn bit Kash. He\xe2\x80\x99s dripping blood everywhere on his shirt. He pulls his hands down and there\xe2\x80\x99s multiple lacerations, I can\xe2\x80\x99t see his eye. I knew it was a very dire emergency.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nImage zoom Sinn and Kash | Credit: Courtesy Kim Zolciak-Biermann\n\nLooking back on it to PEOPLE, Kroy says he\xe2\x80\x99s still coming to terms with what happened. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a process every day,\xe2\x80\x9d Kroy explains. \xe2\x80\x9cBeing right there, it was just wrong place, wrong time, wrong circumstances. The perfect storm. Had one thing been different, it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have happened. You try to say, \xe2\x80\x98What would I have done differently?\xe2\x80\x99 And there are a lot of things. now, but you can\xe2\x80\x99t change any of it. You just have to learn from it and grow from it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are no words to describe something like this,\xe2\x80\x9d Kroy continues. \xe2\x80\x9cI just pray that any parent out there does not have to go through anything traumatic like it. It\xe2\x80\x99s just a horrible feeling to have to go through.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAs Kash was taken to the hospital, Sinn\xe2\x80\x99s trainer immediately came to the Biermann house and removed the dog from the home while Kim and Kroy \xe2\x80\x94 who have six kids total and four other rescue dogs \xe2\x80\x94 decided what to do.\n\nImage zoom Kroy Biermann and Kash | Credit: Courtesy Kim Zolciak-Biermann\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Kim Zolciak-Biermann Surprises Son Kash With Pit Bull Puppy Four Months After Dog Attack\n\nThe decision to keep Sinn didn\xe2\x80\x99t come easy. The Biermanns had rescued Sinn, husky-boxer mix, as a puppy three years earlier. Kroy\xe2\x80\x99s instinct was to get rid him now.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hated Sinn,\xe2\x80\x9d Kroy says. \xe2\x80\x9cI genuinely felt a deep rage for what he had done to my son. Sinn was always a good dog, extremely obedient and protective and not at all aggressive. He\xe2\x80\x99s hyper-active and hyper-sensitive but wants to work and loves to be commanded. I love my dog, and nothing like this had ever happened to me before. But it\xe2\x80\x99s my son. I don\xe2\x80\x99t love anything more than my flesh and blood. I thought, \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to see the dog \xe2\x80\x94 he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get a second chance.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d\n\nFor more on Kim Zolciak-Biermann and Kroy Biermann, pick up this week\xe2\x80\x99s issue of PEOPLE, on newsstands Friday.\n\nImage zoom\n\nComplicating matters was the fact that over the years, Sinn had formed an \xe2\x80\x9cincredible bond\xe2\x80\x9d with Kash. \xe2\x80\x9cSinn and Kash have been best friends since the day we got Sinn,\xe2\x80\x9d Kim says. \xe2\x80\x9cKash is an absolute animal lover, and Sinn is definitely his favorite, without a shadow of a doubt. That\xe2\x80\x99s why it was extra hard.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI genuinely felt a deep rage for what Sinn had done to my son, but Kash loves him,\xe2\x80\x9d Kroy adds.\xe2\x80\x9d We didn\xe2\x80\x99t want him to live a life with a phobia of dogs. We wanted him to understand it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t his fault.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nImage zoom Kroy Biermann, Kash Biermann, and Kim Zolciak-Biermann | Credit: Source: Kim Zolciak-Biermann Instagram\n\nSpeaking with nearly a dozen behavioral specialists, child psychologists and dog-bite survivors, Kim and Kroy spent a lot of time evaluating Kash\xe2\x80\x99s moods and anxiety level after the attack. The boy \xe2\x80\x94 who the Biermanns describe as \xe2\x80\x9csuper strong and positive\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 appeared unfazed, even asking to see Sinn while he was in the hospital.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe saw a service dog in the hospital and he hopped up out of the bed. He was all over the dog, petting the dog and loving on the dog and kissing the dog with no inhibitions,\xe2\x80\x9d Kim remembers. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was unbelievable.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWhat finally clicked for the Biermanns was when they understood that Kash had been bitten, not attacked. \xe2\x80\x9cThat was a turning point for me,\xe2\x80\x9d Kim says, revealing they watched security camera footage of the incident. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was not an attack \xe2\x80\x94 he nipped at Kash\xe2\x80\x99s face in an attempt to communicate with Kash. Not that that is an excuse. But he took off running. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t as if he was attacking. Sinn knew he had done wrong.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf Kash ever looked at me and said that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to be around Sinn or showed any hesitation, then he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be here,\xe2\x80\x9d Kim stresses. \xe2\x80\x9cWe love Sinn, he\xe2\x80\x99s part of our family, but our children will always come first without a doubt.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nImage zoom Kash Biermann | Credit: Source: Kim Zolciak Biermann/Instagram\n\nSeven months and multiple surgeries later, Kash is healthy and 95 percent healed \xe2\x80\x94 even getting a puppy for his birthday in August. And after an eight-week break, Sinn was slowly welcomed back into the home, with some very big changes.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSinn had a lot of freedom before. He would sleep in the crate at night, but during the day he would roam around the house or we\xe2\x80\x99d let him outside. Nobody really watched him. Now his crate is locked with a key that only Kim and I have the keys to. He\xe2\x80\x99s supervised all the time when he\xe2\x80\x99s out. And the only time he runs around free is in the fenced-in dog run we built for him the backyard, which gives him about 400 sq. ft. of grassed space,\xe2\x80\x9d Kroy says.\n\nThe dog\xe2\x80\x99s crate has also been moved out of the home\xe2\x80\x99s high-traffic area to give Sinn some sanctuary. He occasionally wears a muzzle, too.\n\nImage zoom Sinn and Kash | Credit: Courtesy Kim Zolciak-Biermann\n\nRELATED VIDEO: \xe2\x80\x98I Don\xe2\x80\x99t Know Where to Start\xe2\x80\x99: Kim Zolciak-Biermann\xe2\x80\x99s 4-Year-Old Son Hospitalized After Being Bitten by Dog\n\nStill, the biggest change has been that Kim and Kroy now know what to look out for \xe2\x80\x94 and hope that viewers learn from their nightmare.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve taught our kids, no matter how nice dogs are, they are capable of anything and cannot communicate to us in another way than through action \xe2\x80\x94 be it barking, growling, biting, scratching, or running away,\xe2\x80\x9d Kroy says. \xe2\x80\x9cA child sees flurry, fluffy, fun, slobbery \xe2\x80\xa6 they don\xe2\x80\x99t see danger.

After beginning to act as a teenager, Lorenzo Lamas scored his first break with supporting role in the film version of Grease. Today he is perhaps best known for his role as ""Lance Cumson"" on the very popular \'80s television night soap opera Falcon Crest and for the role of ""Reno Raines"" on the \'90s crime drama Renegade, and ""Hector Ramirez"" on the daytime soap opera The Bold and The Beautiful. Lamas is the son of Argentine-born actor/director/heartthrob Fernando Lamas, who made his United States debut in the \'50s hit film The Avengers. Though Lorenzo\'s role on Falcon Crest drew the attention of many a female viewer, in 1984 Lorenzo Lamas was nominated for the Worst Actor \'award\' at the Golden Raspberry Awards for his performance in the film Body Rock, in which Lamas also performed the song ""Fools Like Me"" for the soundtrack (which cracked the Billboard Hot 100 chart). In 2008, Lamas appeared in television ad campaigns for Zaxby\'s (chain) restaurant. Lamas was married to Victoria Hilbert from 1981 to 1982.

Personalize a wide-brim number with an inspirational message, funny phrase or simply your name to make it feel fresh and modern.\n\nWhen it comes to the rest of your outfit, complement the natural material with super-feminine fabric, like Vanessa's lace top, or juxtapose the texture with a soft, shiny satin piece.\n\nStraw handbags will also see a resurgence this year\xe2\x80\x94and not just to the beach. Last summer may have been all about the straw and pom-pom combos, but this season sees plenty of new ways to play with the coarse fibers.\n\nFor instance, Emily Ratajkowski was photographed in LA wearing a Hat Attack straw cross-body (celebs really love this brand) with a floral dress and white sneakers.

"b'Both on- and off-screen the stars of Bravo\'s Real Housewives franchise never cease to surprise their fans. If you\'re in need of even more of a shock factor from the women, then here are a handful of people you never knew the Real Housewives have dated. Now that many of the Housewives are married with families, viewers don\'t often get to hear about their past relationships. Of course, there is the exception for those who can\'t help but brag about whether or not they\'ve dated a celebrity. Do you really think Real Housewives of New York City\'s Sonja Morgan would pass up that chance?\n\nSurprisingly, the women of the Real Housewives have dated, or at least been linked to, many famous people. And the following list of men is actually quite impressive. It includes some extremely talented actors and singers. I mean, one of the women dated George Clooney and another one dated Nick Lachey. It\xe2\x80\x99s crazy, right?\n\nRather than continuing to tease you with names, let\xe2\x80\x99s get to it. Here are 13 famous individuals you probably had no idea some of the Real Housewives stars once dated. Don\xe2\x80\x99t say I didn\xe2\x80\x99t warn you about the surprises that are ahead.\n\n1. George Clooney\n\nMOLLY RILEY/AFP/Getty Images\n\nCan you believe Clooney is connected to one of the Housewives? To be exact, he dated Real Housewives of New York City\'s Carole Radziwill, or so she revealed during an episode. ""We dated literally during the Eisenhower administration,"" she said. Radziwill even called him ""lovely.""\n\n2. Ralph Fiennes\n\nVittorio Zunino Celotto/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images\n\nIn addition to Clooney, Radziwill also dated Ralph Fiennes. She opened up about their one-time summer romance to Us Weekly in July 2014 and said, ""It was long ago and far away \xe2\x80\xa6 over a summer I was living in London."" As for whether or not a particular passage in her book The Widow\'s Guide to Sex and Dating is about her romance with Fiennes, it is not. ""[But] our relationship was not the basis for a storyline in my novel,"" she told Us. ""But like most fiction, stories are a pinch of the writer\'s experience and a part their imagination.""\n\n3. Nick Lachey\n\nNoam Galai/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images\n\nFormer Real Housewives of Orange County star Lizzie Rovsek once dated Nick Lachey. During a July 2014 Watch What Happens Live airing, Andy Cohen brought up to Rovsek how the 98 Degrees singer once revealed in an elevator during a WWHL appearance that he dated the Housewife. Per Cohen, Lachey said, ""Oh my god. This woman that I used to date is about to be an Orange County Housewife."" After Cohen asked Rovsek on WWHL, ""You dated him both pre and post Jessica [Simpson], right?"" she answered, ""Yes.""\n\n4. Russell Simmons\n\nVivien Killilea/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images\n\nRussell Simmons hasn\'t dated only one Housewife, but two Housewives. During a Season 1 Real Housewives of Potomac episode, Katie Rost revealed she dated Simmons. Things did not end well between them, as she documented in some breakup blogs, but despite any drama, they are actually friends.\n\nAccording to Bravo, the other Bravolebrity the Def Jam co-founder dated is none other than Real Housewives of Atlanta star Cynthia Bailey. Actually, Bravo reports that Bailey\'s ex-husband Peter Thomas revealed to Essence in November 2010 that Simmons even proposed to her, but Bailey turned him down.\n\n5. Ben Stiller\n\nAstrid Stawiarz/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images\n\nThis one might come as a huge shock: Ben Stiller dated Brandi Glanville. I repeat, Ben Stiller dated Brandi Glanville in the \'90s. During a February 2016 WWHL appearance Stiller said about dating the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills alum, ""It was short-lived and it was fun. I wouldn\'t characterize it as a relationship. It was a couple of dates, and fun.""\n\nApparently, there has been speculation that Glanville dated Stiller ever since her 2014 book, Drinking and Dating, was released. Per SheKnows, she describes a comedian without naming his name and says he was a ""height-challenged up-and-coming comedian."" SheKnows reports she also writes, ""He had the kind of face you remember. Sharp features, thick dark hair and a goofy grin."" It\'s unclear if this exact passage is about Stiller, but it sure seems likely.\n\n6. Gerard Butler\n\nEmma McIntyre/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images\n\nThey may have not seriously dated, but Gerard Butler is connected to Brandi Glanville. The former Housewife appeared on WWHL in January 2012, where she dished that Butler is the most famous person she\'s ever had sex with besides her ex-husband, Eddie Cibrian. She called it ""a week of fun"" and gave Butler an ""11"" on his bedroom skills. However, when approached by TMZ in January 2012, Butler responded to Glanville\'s claims by asking, ""Who\'s Brandi Glanville?""\n\nHowever, Butler confirmed he did have sex with Glanville to Howard Stern (via New York Daily News) in March 2013. His story differs from the Bravolebrity\'s, because according to him, they spent only an afternoon together rather than a week. ""It was a one-afternooner, but it was fun."" He added, ""She is wild."" As for why he seemingly pretended not to know her, he said, ""You know what I said, \'Who\'s Brandi Glanville?,"" because I didn\'t know her last name, didn\'t know she was a celebrity, didn\'t know she was going to run out and f*cking tell everyone about it!""\n\nHe confronted her about it and she told Cohen on WWHL in March 2013, ""We had a little texting today, and I think he\'s a doll and I feel bad for what I said. He is lovely and I appreciate him making it right.""\n\n7. C. Thomas Howell\n\nRick Diamond/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images\n\nIf you ever wanted to know who RHOBH star Kyle Richards lost her virginity to, here you go. C. Thomas Howell was her first boyfriend and they dated for five years. Richards confirmed to Andy Cohen on his Sirius XM radio show in December 2015 that her first time having sex was with Howell. However, she didn\'t really want to talk about it and said, ""Oh my God, this is so awkward. I\'m so glad my husband isn\'t here right now.""\n\n8. Julio Iglesias\n\nRONALDO SCHEMIDT/AFP/Getty Images\n\nOf course former reality star Yolanda Hadid dated musician Julio Iglesias. In a March 2015 RHOBH episode, Hadid told her co-stars while eating at an Amsterdam restaurant, ""I used to date Julio Iglesias, don\'t know if you guys know him, but when I was dating him 30 years ago, he was the one who brought me here for the first time."" If you want to see a photo of the two in 1986, click here.\n\n9. Jensen Ackles\n\nAlberto E. Rodriguez/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images\n\nDid you know a Supernatural star apparently dated a Real Housewives of Miami star? Based on these photos from Getty Images, Jensen Ackles and Joanna Krupa seem to have once been an item. The kiss and the hand holding sure make it seem like they dated at one point in time. Seeing as the majority of the photos were taken in 2005, they most likely dated 12 years ago.\n\n10. Billy Idol\n\nMike Windle/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images\n\nIf anyone has a long list of famous men they once dated, it\'s RHONY\'s Sonja Morgan. In May 2011, she told Paper magazine that she dated Billy Idol. Morgan said, ""I went out with Billy for a while. That was nice."" She then added, ""It was scary because he was dating Perry Lister, she had red hair and was like six feet tall. He\'s a vegetarian and a very nice man."" It\'s unclear if she dated Idol at the same time as Lister.\n\nThough, in April 2011, Morgan told the New York Post that ""there were some Billy Idol days,"" after being asked about her past boyfriends. She then added, ""Dating is a strong word for some people."" Who knows if she and Idol were serious or not.\n\n11. Matt Dillon\n\nVALERY HACHE/AFP/Getty Images\n\nNext for Morgan is actor Matt Dillon. She also told Paper magazine, ""Yeah, we had one whole date. Then he left me to go with another girl. It\'s an experience and it\'s fun."" That\'s all we know about this supposed date between Morgan and Dillon, but who else wants to hear more details?\n\n12. Owen Wilson\n\nJeff Spicer/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images\n\nWhile appearing on WWHL in April 2015, Morgan revealed she dated Owen Wilson. She didn\'t elaborate any further than saying they dated. In January 2013, Morgan chatted with Star Pulse and said the following about Wilson, ""My celebrity crushes are the kooky, fun and quirky guys. Men like Owen Wilson, who I\xe2\x80\x99ve had a flirt with, as he\xe2\x80\x99s cute and brilliant.""\n\n13. Eric Clapton\n\nLarry Busacca/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images\n\nDuring her April 2015 WWHL appearance, Morgan also confirmed she dated Eric Clapton. In a June 2012 RHONY episode, Morgan actually brought up Clapton\'s name after Aviva Drescher pulled out a bag holding one of her prosthetic legs. She said, ""I know that bag, Eric Clapton used to bring it to lunch then we\'d go play pool."" Before that, in a May 2011 blog post for Bravo, Morgan mentioned Clapton and wrote, ""I was introduced to several good restaurants by my dear old friend Eric Clapton. Boy did we have a great time.""\n\nThere you have it. Some of the Real Housewives sure have a history with many famous faces.'"
"b""Back in the \xe2\x80\x9890s, female-driven comedies were a rarity in Hollywood. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t until 2011 that Bridesmaids became a sleeper hit, unsuspectingly breaking box office records and thereby paving the way for everybody else. So when writer-producer and Groundlings alumna Robin Schiff wrote a screenplay about a pair of airheaded girls from the Valley who concoct an elaborate ruse for their ten-year high school reunion, the possibility that the project would come to fruition remained sadly unlikely.\n\nBut after the original incarnation became a play and then, briefly, a short-lived TV pilot, Romy and Michele\xe2\x80\x99s High School Reunion\xe2\x80\x94which premiered in theaters 20 years ago today\xe2\x80\x94amassed a rabid following, thanks to its pithy one-liners (\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m the Mary and you\xe2\x80\x99re the Rhoda!\xe2\x80\x9d), iconic costumes, catchy soundtrack, and tender relatability. The film was an ode to the outcasts: Not only do its titular heroines, played impeccably by Mira Sorvino and Lisa Kudrow, conquer their high school demons\xe2\x80\x94they discover a newfound sense of self in the process.\n\nVIDEO: The Top 5 Most Expensive Movies Ever Made\n\nIn honor of Romy and Michele\xe2\x80\x99s High School Reunion\xe2\x80\x99s 20th anniversary, we reached out to the cast and crew, including Mira Sorvino, Lisa Kudrow, and Alan Cumming, to reminisce about the making of the cult classic.\n\nImage zoom Credit: Alamy\n\nDavid Mirkin (director): It\xe2\x80\x99s nightmarish that it\xe2\x80\x99s been 20 years. You remember things so vividly, you have no idea the amount of time that has passed.\n\nMira Sorvino (Romy White): The number of years crept up on me, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten married and had four kids since then, so I guess I can believe it.\n\nLisa Kudrow (Michele Weinberger): I saw it in my mind as something that was 10 years ago, then my husband reminded me that it was 20.\n\nAlan Cumming (Sandy Frink): It\xe2\x80\x99s terrifying. But I suppose it does make sense mathematically.\n\nJulia Campbell (Christy Masters): I was shocked when my agent told me. It feels like just yesterday.\n\nElaine Hendrix (Lisa Luder): Twenty years really sneaks up on you.\n\nVincent Ventresca (Billy Christianson): It\xe2\x80\x99s crazy. I just turned 50, so there are all these chunks of time that I\xe2\x80\x99m measuring things by.\n\nJacob Vargas (Ramon): I only worked one day on the film\xe2\x80\x94I did two scenes. It\xe2\x80\x99s amazing to see what an impression a character can make in such a short period of time.\n\nImage zoom Credit: Alamy; Getty\n\nRobin Schiff (screenwriter): It all started when I went to a club called Carlos 'n Charlie\xe2\x80\x99s on the Sunset Strip for research and overheard two women in the bathroom. One of them said, \xe2\x80\x9cOh my god, I hate my hair.\xe2\x80\x9d And the other one said, \xe2\x80\x9cYour hair? I\xe2\x80\x99d trade your hair for my hair in two seconds.\xe2\x80\x9d There was a musical cadence to it. I went home, and by the time I got there, I had the characters. Two Disney executives thought it could be a female Wayne\xe2\x80\x99s World. I started brainstorming what to do with the characters for a movie: Romy and Michele Go to College, Romy and Michele Go to Japan. Then I finally thought, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat if they get invited to their reunion and don\xe2\x80\x99t realize that their lives haven\xe2\x80\x99t amounted to anything until they fill out the questionnaire?\xe2\x80\x9d That made me laugh.\n\nDavid Mirkin: We wanted to make a movie that was nastier than your average high school film. There wasn\xe2\x80\x99t even a happy ending. Not everyone gets together. It shows a lot of disillusionment. It shows a lot of problems.\n\nMira Sorvino: I was a geek in high school, and [the script] really struck a chord with me, as did the opportunity to do a female buddy comedy. It was like a female Dumb and Dumber, but with a ton of heart. The audience really relates to the pain that they\xe2\x80\x99re in\xe2\x80\x94the humiliation of people judging them and being nasty to them and the beauty of their friendship. Most people were not the homecoming king and queen.\n\nLisa Kudrow: To me, it was mostly about two idiots. I knew there was some heart to it because they love each other and they\xe2\x80\x99re there for eachother. Everyone\xe2\x80\x99s been an outsider, especially in adolescence, so who can\xe2\x80\x99t relate to that? And not being aware: \xe2\x80\x9cWait, what group were we in? What? I didn\xe2\x80\x99t realize we were losers.\xe2\x80\x9d That part rang true to me.\n\nRobin Schiff: My original idea was to make the characters super jappy, so [the names] Romy and Michele seemed jappy to me.\n\nLisa Kudrow: I grew up in the Valley, so I drew on girls I knew from school. In junior high, I went through a brief phase of not using any vowels.\n\nDavid Mirkin: Mira\xe2\x80\x99s accent was hilarious because she talked like someone who came from Philadelphia. I thought it was wrong in just the right way. It was Valley girl with an odd twist.\n\nAlan Cumming: There was a real wit to [the script]. It subverted the standard Hollywood buddy picture and made the stars two women. I remember talking to Robin [Schiff] one day and saying, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m the girl in this film, aren\xe2\x80\x99t I?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nCamryn Manheim (Toby Walters): I love the fact that the women matured and became resourceful and creative. It proved that kindness and humanity rises to the top.\n\nDavid Mirkin: Originally, the movie didn\xe2\x80\x99t have an ending. The girls didn\xe2\x80\x99t get a boutique\xe2\x80\x94they flew away with Sandy Frink and that was it. It became important to me that, even though Romy and Michele were idiots, they were also savants: Where they chose to live and what they chose to wear and how talented they were had to result in them having a boutique at the end.\n\nImage zoom Credit: Buena Vista/courtesy Everett Collection\n\nDavid Mirkin: I\xe2\x80\x99d been running The Simpsons and was sent a lot of scripts to direct. I loved working with strong funny women\xe2\x80\x94there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t enough of that at the time, and it was so much fun to do. Then I got the script, which had been in development hell for a long time, and I saw immediately that it had enormous potential. It was really original and different.\n\nMona May (costume designer): I was riding the big wave of Clueless and met David Mirkin while working on ABC\xe2\x80\x99s The Edge. He wanted to bring someone on to create a style for the film. It\xe2\x80\x99s easy to make Valley girls in California look cheesy\xe2\x80\x94he wanted something that was fashion-forward. I thought it would be a great opportunity to marry this fashion flick with great comedy.\n\nMira Sorvino: I had been nominated for an Oscar that year [for Mighty Aphrodite] and was offered the part. I remember reading the script on the subway and cracking up. People were giving me funny looks.\n\nDavid Mirkin: There was a tiny period of time when Toni Collette was being considered for Romy. I think she had a concern about doing the accent. Then I had lunch with Mira. I thought it was a longshot, but we hit it off so well, and I knew that her and Lisa would have great chemistry.\n\nLisa Kudrow: I was in the Groundlings and one of my teachers recommended me to Robin Schiff, who was holding a backer\xe2\x80\x99s audition for the play Ladies\xe2\x80\x99 Room. It was my first audition ever, and I got it. There were so many funny scenes: Romy would say, \xe2\x80\x9cI hate throwing up in public,\xe2\x80\x9d and Michele would go, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, me too!\xe2\x80\x9d That must be why we\xe2\x80\x99re friends, because we have this one unique thing in common. [Laughs]\n\nRobin Schiff: That line\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cMe too!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94was the line that got Lisa the job, because of the way she exclaimed it. Even though I\xe2\x80\x99d written it, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t realize the true extent of what I had written.\n\nLisa Kudrow: Before the movie, we did a failed pilot, then it went away for a while and nothing really came of it. Then I got Friends and Robin called and said, \xe2\x80\x9cSo they want to go ahead with a movie.\xe2\x80\x9d I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know if it would really happen. Then they got Mira Sorvino, and I was like, \xe2\x80\x9cHoly crap\xe2\x80\x94she just got nominated for an Oscar!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMira Sorvino: I was a big fan of Lisa\xe2\x80\x99s, and she was already attached when I signed on.\n\nLisa Kudrow: Mira and I connected immediately. She\xe2\x80\x99s a woman with no guile. There\xe2\x80\x99s no agenda. And she\xe2\x80\x99s smart.\n\nDavid Mirkin: I think you can only sell people on a deep friendship if there\xe2\x80\x99s a true connection between the actors. Mira and Lisa started to become genuine friends before we even started to shoot. And of course they iced me completely afterward. [Laughs]\n\nAlan Cumming: I had just come to Hollywood after doing Circle of Friends, and I remember reading Romy and Michele and thinking, \xe2\x80\x9cThis is so witty and funny.\xe2\x80\x9d I was told I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to get [the role]\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s the boy part in a big-budget film and I was new blood. But I really pushed. I had never been in America before. I had never been in a Hollywood movie before.\n\nJulia Campbell: I was doing a comedy playing [actor] Kevin Nealon\xe2\x80\x99s wife, and David Mirkin is one of Kevin\xe2\x80\x99s best friends and would come to the tapings. After I got the offer, it got pulled because somebody at Disney\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember who\xe2\x80\x94said that I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t pretty enough. Then David brought me back for a cast read-through and I got the job.\n\nElaine Hendrix: Interestingly enough, I auditioned to play another member of the A-Group. Then the actress who signed on to play Lisa Luder got let go and I was put in the Lisa Luder role.\n\nVincent Ventresca: I was on a half-hour show on NBC called Boston Common and auditioned during the summer of our first hiatus. I remember the [casting directors] were laughing really hard, and I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t really doing anything. Sometimes, when you\xe2\x80\x99re right for it, you don\xe2\x80\x99t really try anything\xe2\x80\x94it comes out of your mouth and it just works. I read for the drunk scene: \xe2\x80\x9cRomy? Michele? Weren\xe2\x80\x99t you guys totally in love with me in high school?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nCamryn Manheim: I was on The Practice at the time and went on a routine audition for it. It was not a departure for me: I am Toby Walters. I\xe2\x80\x99m always in your face. I always want to schedule everything.\n\nJacob Vargas: I remember auditioning and having a good time with it. I decided to make [Ramon] really sleazy, just a real horndog. I guess it worked.\n\nImage zoom Credit: Alamy\n\nRobin Schiff: I wrote very improvisationally. As soon as I got the idea for Romy and Michele to lie, there were a million things they could lie about. Then one day I was watching The Monkees\xe2\x80\x99 TV show and one of their mothers invented liquid paper. I tried to think of something else like that, and I thought of Post-its.\n\nMira Sorvino: The scene where I tell off the A-Group was not in the original script, but I kept telling Robin that we needed to have a big moment there. That was something for all of us who have suffered at the hands of cruel people. They needed that moment of vindication. We came up with that speech together.\n\nLisa Kudrow: If I had an idea, I was definitely allowed to add on. When they\xe2\x80\x99re at the reunion and Romy gets upset because everyone laughs at her, I felt like Michele was getting annoyed. So I said, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, do you think you can stop being such a baby?\xe2\x80\x9d I\xe2\x80\x99d been chasing after her the whole reunion!\n\nAlan Cumming: I think Lisa and I improvised quite a lot in the limo scene. She took me to the Groundlings one night while we were filming: People shouted things in the audience and you had to just do them, and the second half is an entirely improvised play. I was like a deer in headlights the entire time.\n\nJacob Vargas: I remember adding in the rolling r: \xe2\x80\x9cRrrrrramon.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nImage zoom Credit: Alamy\n\nMona May: Everything came from the page. They\xe2\x80\x99re young girls, free-spirited, living by themselves in the Valley. They were smart, but silly. Moschino is prevalent in the film. And I loved Blumarine and Versus Versace. I\xe2\x80\x99d pair it with stuff that I found in thrift stores on Melrose Avenue. Mixing the high and the low was very fresh at the time.\n\nDavid Mirkin: I wanted to create a world where the girls lived inside the pages of a magazine. We shot in places that were very strong in primary colors, and they dressed in primary colors.\n\nRobin Schiff: I love what David did with all the colors. The whole movie is like being inside of a toy box. Because of the way it was shot and styled, it was never trendy. Even when it came out, it was its own thing, like Pee-wee\xe2\x80\x99s Big Adventure.\n\nMona May: Using color was very important. There was a very distinct palette. Except Janeane [Garofalo]. She was like, \xe2\x80\x9cI want to wear black. Give me some galoshes.\xe2\x80\x9d And Justin Theroux had to be in all black as her cowboy.\n\nLisa Kudrow: Our wardrobe was like a piece of candy or dessert. We looked like dolls. Or people in drag.\n\nMira Sorvino: A couple of the pieces were actually mine: The silver dress that I wore in the club, when I excused myself because my foot was filling up with blood, and the Armani suit for the business woman outfit.\n\nMona May: We wanted to make the business woman suits look classic, but each girl had their own look: Lisa\xe2\x80\x99s was very fitted\xe2\x80\x94it had a shorter jacket with a low neckline. And Mira\xe2\x80\x99s was very business-like. Her jacket was longer and the shoulders were stronger.\n\nLisa Kudrow: I loved those suits! It felt like my style. I loved all the job interview suits, too. Those were cute.\n\nMona May: We put Lisa in Moschino skirt suits with funny little buttons for interviews. You had to believe everything was homemade\xe2\x80\x94it could never look like something you got off the rack at Macy\xe2\x80\x99s. We hand-stitched the dresses for the dance sequence and used spandex so they could move around and nothing would rip. Each one was the same shape: a very simple A-line cut with an empire waist. The outfits had to be empowering: In that moment, the girls believed it was okay to be who they are. They felt good in their skin and weren\xe2\x80\x99t afraid to show it.\n\nLisa Kudrow: Those dresses were surprisingly comfortable and forgiving. Mira had imagined that Romy is kind of a Trekkie, even though it\xe2\x80\x99s not anywhere in the script. So her dress was blue and did have certain lines that you\xe2\x80\x99d see in a Star Trek episode. [Laughs]\n\nMona May: I painted that Star Trek detail on Mira\xe2\x80\x99s dress.\n\nMira Sorvino: I think that was my idea! I\xe2\x80\x99m a huge Star Trek geek.\n\nMona May: And the gym outfits! Their boobs almost were falling out. Only Romy and Michele would wear slutty club outfits to the gym.\n\nMira Sorvino: Walking on the treadmill with high platform heels was brilliant.\n\nLisa Kudrow: Wearing a bra [in the dream sequence] was not particularly fun for me, even though it probably had more material on it than a bathing suit top. I just thought, \xe2\x80\x9cOne day I\xe2\x80\x99m going to have children, and here I am.\xe2\x80\x9d Oh well.\n\nMona May: Romy and Michele\xe2\x80\x99s prom outfits were a tribute to Madonna. Mira wore this really short Betsey Johnson dress with a pink tutu, and Lisa had the vintage bustier and lace skirt. The A-Group\xe2\x80\x99s outfits looked like bad bridesmaid dresses\xe2\x80\x94horrible lavender and green and peach with ruffles. I designed Elaine to look like she was wearing Chanel. So you see a foreshadowing of someone who separates themselves from the group with her style.\n\nJulia Campbell: The pastels were a signature. I had the lavender skirt when I was in high school, the lavender eye shadow ... all the way through the three main time periods: lavender.\n\nElaine Hendrix: Mona decided that each girl was going to have her own color palette. Mine was neutral because I was on a fashion track, which led to the suit at the end.\n\nMona May: Nobody in that group would ever wear a cream suit. It was a super timeless, Lauren Hutton-inspired suit.\n\nAlan Cumming: My rubber shoes were kind of hard to walk in\xe2\x80\x94it was like wearing platforms. A lot of tripping went down.\n\nMona May: We made Alan\xe2\x80\x99s shoes. They had to have thick rubber soles, but also look high fashion and expensive because Sandy had a lot of money.\n\nJacob Vargas: Ramon fancied himself a Romeo\xe2\x80\x94he was very confident. So he had the rolled sleeves, the gold chain, the gold watch.\n\nMona May: We totally focused on Ramon\xe2\x80\x99s biceps. [Laughs]\n\nImage zoom Credit: Buena Vista/courtesy Everett Collection\n\nMira Sorvino: The dance number was great. We rehearsed for three weeks for that. My physical visual inspiration was a linebacker in drag.\n\nLisa Kudrow: Mira took ballet, so she brilliantly decided to aggressively pirouette around things. At the rehearsals, it got to a point where I told Smith [Wordes], the choreographer, \xe2\x80\x9cLook, I don\xe2\x80\x99t dance, as you can see now.\xe2\x80\x9d It made sense to me that Michele simply poses.\n\nDavid Mirkin: Originally, it was not an emotional dance sequence. It was a disco dance\xe2\x80\x94like [John] Travolta to \xe2\x80\x9cStayin\xe2\x80\x99 Alive.\xe2\x80\x9d But when Billy ditches Romy at the dance in the flashback, I wanted to show the complete breakdown and the importance of Michele helping her by dancing with her. That led to the song \xe2\x80\x9cTime After Time,\xe2\x80\x9d which connects to the dance at the end. You can do intense emotion at the same time you can do comedy.\n\nRobin Schiff: I wanted to take a low moment and make it into a high moment. I was a really visceral way to give them their moment of triumph other than telling off the A-Group.\n\nAlan Cumming: The dance was one paragraph in the script, but it was great to discover that they really wanted to go for it. It was a bit exhausting, because we had to do it so many times.\n\nLisa Kudrow: At some point it stopped being fun, that\xe2\x80\x99s for sure.\n\nRobin Schiff: The line in the movie that always makes me laugh out loud is in the flash-forward, when Sandy says, \xe2\x80\x9cHave you been terribly unhappy with me all these years?\xe2\x80\x9d and Michele says, \xe2\x80\x9cNo, I\xe2\x80\x99ve just been lonely with no one to talk to.\xe2\x80\x9d It\xe2\x80\x99s such a dark joke, and it encapsulates so much about marriage.\n\nMira Sorvino: Lisa was so brilliant as an old lady. She was a natural. I looked a lot like my elderly Italian relatives. It was kind of scary.\n\nLisa Kudrow: It was assumed that Michele would\xe2\x80\x99ve had some plastic surgery in her life, so that\xe2\x80\x99s how her face would age after that. I thought, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, if this is how I\xe2\x80\x99ll look, that\xe2\x80\x99s not so bad. Maybe I\xe2\x80\x99ll have more dignified hair.\xe2\x80\x9d We also put colored contact lenses in because your eyes get lighter as you get older. Who knew?\n\nAlan Cumming: I\xe2\x80\x99m probably the only person in Hollywood who loved having a turkey neck.\n\nVincent Ventresca: I was like, \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99m going to look like? Yikes.\xe2\x80\x9d And then at the reunion, my [prosthetic] stomach was insane. When I had it on, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t even have to worry about how to play the scene. You just felt it.\n\nJulia Campbell: I loved wearing the prosthetic belly\xe2\x80\x94that was wild. It really did look like a pregnancy belly. And when the helicopter went up in the air and blew my dress up to show my granny panties. I still have those lavender Hanes!\n\nAlan Cumming: I remember the day after that helicopter scene, a bunch of the cast went to IHOP for breakfast. I remember discovering IHOP and thinking, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is international about this? It seems pretty American to me.\xe2\x80\x9d Everything about that movie was a crash course: I had never been to a high school reunion, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know how to pronounce \xe2\x80\x9cTucson\xe2\x80\x9d or what mono was. Back braces were a new concept to me as well.\n\nRobin Schiff: The dream sequence was special. When we initially pitched the movie, it was the original ending, but executives thought that it didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem real enough. It\xe2\x80\x99s very unconventional to have a 20-minute dream sequence that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t advance the plot.\n\nAlan Cumming: The makeup in the dream sequence was funny because I got to choose: I had Alec Baldwin\xe2\x80\x99s lips, Brad Pitt\xe2\x80\x99s chin, somebody else\xe2\x80\x99s forehead. I made this amalgam of handsome Hollywood hunks on my face and attached it to my body.\n\nLisa Kudrow: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how long [Alan] spent with the prosthetic chin. I was like, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy\xe2\x80\x99d you have to have that?\xe2\x80\x9d [Laughs]\n\nDavid Mirkin: I wanted the dream sequence to start out normal and then just get odder and odder, so I had the idea of Lisa getting hit by the limo. I\xe2\x80\x99m a fan of violent physical comedy, and Lisa\xe2\x80\x99s the perfect person to go flying through the air.\n\nLisa Kudrow: I thought it would be really funny if, after it happened, she says, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, come on.\xe2\x80\x9d She had to just acknowledge how ridiculous it was.\n\nCamryn Manheim: I love when I fly over the car. I remember them attaching me to some big contraption. I was strapped in and suspended over the car in a crane.\n\nElaine Hendrix: I loved doing the reunion scene, when I got to give the A-Group their comeuppance. I wanted to be even more in-your-face about it, but David wanted to reel it back a little.\n\nJacob Vargas: I remember Mira Sorvino had just gotten nominated for an Academy Award. I was like, \xe2\x80\x9cHey, congratulations on your Oscar nomination. Let\xe2\x80\x99s have fake sex!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLisa Kudrow: The wrap gift was a Post-it dispenser. I still have it, and it\xe2\x80\x99s still dispensing Post-its.\n\nImage zoom Credit: Alamy\n\nDavid Mirkin: There\xe2\x80\x99s so much to relate to in the casual cruelness of a true high school experience. We tried not to pull any punches.\n\nRobin Schiff: The movie shows how it\xe2\x80\x99s okay to be different. There\xe2\x80\x99s a message that you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to be anything but who you are to impress people.\n\nMira Sorvino: There\xe2\x80\x99s definitely a relatability factor. People can see themselves as Romy and Michele. They\xe2\x80\x99re lovable losers who think they\xe2\x80\x99re smart but they\xe2\x80\x99re really stupid, in a harmless way. Line by line, the movie is so funny.\n\nLisa Kudrow: It\xe2\x80\x99s about people who were outsiders and had each other for support.\n\nAlan Cumming: I think the personalities are universal: There\xe2\x80\x99s always the mean girls, the jock, the geeky one, and the girls who are trying to get into the cool group. No matter where you come from, there\xe2\x80\x99s always that hierarchy in school. Everybody feels like they\xe2\x80\x99re not cool enough. But you realize that the cool people aren\xe2\x80\x99t really cool\xe2\x80\x94they\xe2\x80\x99re just as weird as you are. If you\xe2\x80\x99re competent and have fun, then that\xe2\x80\x99s cool. It\xe2\x80\x99s a very affirming film for geeks and freaks and people who don\xe2\x80\x99t fit in.\n\nJulia Campbell: It\xe2\x80\x99s a movie about independence and flying your freak flag and being okay with it, especially when you have your best friend with you. That\xe2\x80\x99s really all you need during those awkward years.\n\nElaine Hendrix: I think people relate to the experience: The majority of people identify with this movie\xe2\x80\x99s journey\xe2\x80\x94the hell that most people experience in high school, then going to a reunion and seeing how some people are still stuck in that time and others have moved on. People want to innately cheer for the underdogs, and Romy and Michele were the underdogs. And they get validated at the end.\n\nCamryn Manheim: Romy and Michele is the gift that keeps on giving. I\xe2\x80\x99ve done great work with Anthony Hopkins, Broadway shows, but people still run up to me on the street and say, \xe2\x80\x9cPlease don\xe2\x80\x99t tell me to f*ck off, because it really hurts my feelings.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAlan Cumming: You have no idea how many people say to me, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m so glad you had your notebook.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nJulia Campbell: I definitely get, \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re pregnant, you half-wit\xe2\x80\x9d a lot.\n\nVincent Ventresca: I think David Mirkin had a vision. His particular brand of humor is so unique. [The movie] was so ridiculous, then all of a sudden, a Cyndi Lauper song would come on and you were crying. And you knew both of those things did live right next to each other when you were in high school. It felt honest, it felt true, and completely relatable.\n\nCamryn Manheim: We all have those stories. We all know what it feels like to be left out, or be the person that\xe2\x80\x99s oppressing other people to make ourselves feel better. We all have stuff happening at home that trickles into our lives. It was told in this fantastical way that was so accessible\xe2\x80\x94we could all see each other in there.\n\nJacob Vargas: I think it touched on everybody\xe2\x80\x99s insecure nerd in a sense. In high school, we\xe2\x80\x99re all trying to find our way. You feel like there\xe2\x80\x99s another crowd that\xe2\x80\x99s better than you, or you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to impress somebody, but then you realize that everybody\xe2\x80\x99s in the same boat. It\xe2\x80\x99s still as relevant now as it was 20 years ago.\n\nImage zoom Credit: Alamy; Getty\n\nRobin Schiff: If I could think of something as good as the original, then I would be open to it. We\xe2\x80\x99re actually doing a musical adaptation at The 5th Avenue Theatre in Seattle this summer.\n\nDavid Mirkin: I would never say no to working with those women and that cast, but it would have to be material that we all agreed was really good. You don\xe2\x80\x99t want to ruin what was there.\n\nMona May: It would be fun to think about what designers they would be into now.\n\nMira Sorvino: I think there\xe2\x80\x99s definitely an appetite for it. The fandom seems to be growing in cult popularity rather than diminishing as the years go on, which is a phenomenon to me.\n\nLisa Kudrow: Robin and I were talking about a sequel: Romy and Michele Get Divorced. It would probably be them having a split as well as their marriages. On the other hand, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want Sandy and Michele to get divorced.\n\nRobin Schiff: Hilariously, I remember it as Romy and Michele Get Married, and Lisa remembers it as Romy and Michele Get Divorced. The idea was that Romy and Michele had their store, and this woman with a store nearby was getting married before them, so they tell her that they\xe2\x80\x99re getting married, and they start planning a double wedding with no fianc\xc3\xa9s. Sandy was out of the picture. In my mind, Sandy and Michele were ever going to end up together. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think they have that much in common. Can you imagine them having a conversation?\n\nAlan Cumming: I\xe2\x80\x99m totally into [a sequel]. There was an alternate ending where Michele and I were married and Romy had come to live with us.\n\nJulia Campbell: If everybody else was down, of course I would be. It was such a well-cast film.\n\nElaine Hendrix: We\xe2\x80\x99ve all individually talked about it with each other. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if it ever would or could happen, but I\xe2\x80\x99d be down.\n\nJacob Vargas: I would love to revisit Ramon again.\n\nVincent Ventresca: I\xe2\x80\x99m still trying to figure out why we never made another one. How perfect would that be?"""

I didn\xe2\x80\x99t report it because of many reasons,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cFirst off, I was in complete shock and total denial. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to view myself as a victim so I suppressed it and pretended it never happened.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAs she was in a relationship with the perpetrator, Breslin was unsure if reporting the incident would cause more issues.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was in a relationship with my rapist and feared not being believed,\xe2\x80\x9d she wrote. \xe2\x80\x9cI also feared that if my case didn\xe2\x80\x99t lead anywhere, he would still find out and hurt me even more.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShe continued, \xe2\x80\x9cThird, I knew how hurt my family and friends would be after finding out and I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to put them thru that.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBreslin said she was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder following the incident.

"b""The Amy Schumer-Goldie Hawn comedy \xe2\x80\x9cSnatched\xe2\x80\x9d should really be called \xe2\x80\x9cAmy and Goldie Go to Ecuador\xe2\x80\x9d and be one in a churned-out series like the \xe2\x80\x9cBlondie\xe2\x80\x9d movies of the 1940s. That kind of context might help this sloppy, fitfully funny trifle go down easier than it does now, shouldering the mantle of summer event comedy, eagerly awaited follow-up to Schumer\xe2\x80\x99s breakout hit \xe2\x80\x9cTrainwreck,\xe2\x80\x9d and return after a 15-year multiplex hiatus for screen legend Goldie Hawn.\n\nThe build-up felt formidable: the promise of a zeitgeisty, unapologetically raunchy stand-up comic and a screwball icon taking the female buddy comedy to the \xe2\x80\x9cenne\xe2\x80\x9d-th power. But what we\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten in \xe2\x80\x9cSnatched\xe2\x80\x9d is an uninspired, scattershot disaster romp that mostly serves the talents of one half of the marquee pairing, underuses the other half, and struggles to blend R-rated humor, foreign misadventure, and oil-and-water mother-daughter dynamic into a cohesive diversion.\n\nThere are plenty of worse comedies out there, but \xe2\x80\x9cSnatched\xe2\x80\x9d has that vexing air of disappointment to it.\n\nWatch Video: Amy Schumer and Goldie Hawn Have Got a Gun in New 'Snatched' Trailer\n\nIt also feels like three movies stitched together with hectoring and vagina jokes. The first is a snicker-worthy if tepid urban dating comedy that could just as easily have been a chunk on \xe2\x80\x9cInside Amy Schumer.\xe2\x80\x9d As self-centered Emily, fired from her retail job and dumped by her disengaged rock n\xe2\x80\x99 roll boyfriend (Randall Park) right before their planned vacation to Ecuador, Schumer is in familiar territory here, mining social embarrassment and misplaced ambition for queasy laughs. (Though it stretches credibility that even someone as clueless as Emily would not ask for time off from even a job she hates, as a joke establishing cluelessness, Schumer knows how to sell it.)\n\nEmily\xe2\x80\x99s last resort for licking her wounds is decamping to her mom\xe2\x80\x99s, with the expected judgment and frustration that entails. A onetime wild girl forced to become a single mom, Linda (Hawn) is now a cheery shut-in with lots of cats, an agoraphobic manboy for a live-in son (Ike Barinholtz), and a fear of what lies outside her suburban home. Emily hasn\xe2\x80\x99t always been on the best of terms with her, but desperate for a South American plus-one, she begs her mom to go, and in the interest of repairing a fractured relationship, Linda accepts.\n\nAlso Read: Can 'King Arthur' or 'Snatched' Dethrone 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2' at Box Office?\n\nMovie number two emerges, which is a predictable fish-out-of-water lark in sunny environs. Linda, swaddled in clothes and suspicious of everyone, can\xe2\x80\x99t relax at their fancy beachside resort, while Emily is ready for anything, especially after meeting a handsome, flirtatious stranger (Tom Bateman) at the hotel bar. After he escorts her to a nighttime forest bacchanale of drinking, dancing and Capoeira, he offers to take Emily and her mom on a culture-expanding excursion the next day.\n\nThe trip is a trap, however, and the women are summarily kidnapped, thrown into a dingy cell, and held for ransom by a ruthless sort named Morgado (Oscar Jaenada), who \xe2\x80\x94 if we\xe2\x80\x99re keeping tabs on Hollywood\xe2\x80\x99s representation of foreign lands \xe2\x80\x94 is the first native character, and one of the only ones, with more than three lines.\n\nWhat follows, once the women escape and must fend for themselves in the wilds of the Ecuador-Colombia border with a vengeful captor on their tail, is the third movie inside \xe2\x80\x9cSnatched,\xe2\x80\x9d a sputtering \xe2\x80\x9cOutrageous Fortune\xe2\x80\x9d update that you wish had more of the fleet, funny, even emotional crackle of \xe2\x80\x9cRomancing the Stone.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWatch Video: Amy Schumer's Dad Cries When He Meets His Idol, Goldie Hawn\n\nDirector Jonathan Levine (\xe2\x80\x9c50/50,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThe Night Before\xe2\x80\x9d), no visual stylist, seems truly lost when the canvas of Katie Dippold\xe2\x80\x99s string-of-hazards screenplay grows from the usual two-person shticking \xe2\x80\x94 including a frequently returned-to gag in which Emily\xe2\x80\x99s distraught brother repeatedly calls a disinterested State Department employee (Bashir Salahuddin) \xe2\x80\x94 to include wacky doings (chases, killing, forced ziplining) in exotic locations. \xe2\x80\x9cSnatched\xe2\x80\x9d seems almost afraid of taking on any breadth or scope, or evoking anything like real peril.\n\nSave the occasionally jangly/funny setpiece \xe2\x80\x94 seeking help from a dubiously intrepid tour guide (Christopher Meloni), a tapeworm extraction by a friendly village doctor, and the rescue efforts of befriended lesbian couple Ruth (Wanda Sykes) and her mute ex-special forces partner Barb (a hilarious Joan Cusack) \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cSnatched\xe2\x80\x9d never finds solid comedic footing.\n\nThe biggest casualty on that front is how thinly drawn Hawn\xe2\x80\x99s character is, and how weakly the issues between Emily and Linda play out when \xe2\x80\x9cSnatched\xe2\x80\x9d takes a breath between mishaps to find real feeling. Schumer has plenty of room to mine Emily\xe2\x80\x99s many faults for uncomfortable laughs, and even genuine hurt as an emotional mess looking for respect rather than evaluation in her mother\xe2\x80\x99s eyes. (She was similarly affecting in \xe2\x80\x9cTrainwreck\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x98s daughter scenes.) But it\xe2\x80\x99s a one-sided affair, with Hawn hamstrung by \xe2\x80\x9ctold you so\xe2\x80\x9d reactions and displays of matriarchal strength that any actress her age could pull off.\n\nConsidering this sun-kissed Oscar winner\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9970s-\xe2\x80\x9980s heyday at the forefront of fizzy movie comedy, it\xe2\x80\x99s surprising she gets hardly any chances to turn Linda into her own agent of silly mayhem. Though you can see real fondness between the veteran and the up-and-comer as they go through the motions of frazzledness and reconciliation, \xe2\x80\x9cSnatched\xe2\x80\x9d doesn\xe2\x80\x99t do their matchup any favors."""

"b""It\xe2\x80\x99s rare to find me without my curls smoothed, twisted by a curling iron into beach waves, and misted with texture spray. I love to have my hair done. A trip to the local blow-dry bar is my favorite Saturday afternoon pastime. However, at $50 a session, getting this look done by professionals on the regular is costly. So I\xe2\x80\x99ve perfected my own blowout skills.\n\nIt may seem like an easy task: grab a blow-dryer, point, and blast with heat. But there is a mastery behind it. And you may be making simple mistakes that are actually hurting your hair even more than your look. Here, top pros break down the science to getting a gorgeous at-home blowout every single time and point out all the rookie mistakes that keep them in business.\n\n1. You don\xe2\x80\x99t have a great blow-dryer.\n\nLet\xe2\x80\x99s start at the very beginning: Investing in a high-quality tool is important, especially if you have a lot of hair or you\xe2\x80\x99re blow-drying your hair often.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you have thick hair, you\xe2\x80\x99re probably damaging your hair more with a cheap blow-dryer as opposed to investing in a great one that will protect your hair and blow-dry it quicker,\xe2\x80\x9d K\xc3\xa9rastase celebrity stylist Jennifer Yepez tells SELF. Expensive dryers tend to come with hair-saving smart features like high power, multiple heat settings, a cool shot, and ionic air technology. The last one helps with frizz, creates shine, and minimizes blow-dry time. \xe2\x80\x9cThe technology in ionic hair dryers helps break down water molecules faster, which makes the hair dry faster,\xe2\x80\x9d she adds. The less time your hair is under heat and the more control you have over the temperature, the healthier it will be.\n\nYepez\xe2\x80\x99s favorites are the new T3 Cura Luxe ($250) and the Dyson Supersonic ($399). Expensive? Yes, but you\xe2\x80\x99ll pay for it in what you save skipping just five to 10 blowouts at the salon\xe2\x80\x94and they\xe2\x80\x99ll last you years.\n\n2. You\xe2\x80\x99re spending too long with your hair wrapped in a towel.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter getting out of the shower, women tend to leave their hair in the towel for like 30 minutes,\xe2\x80\x9d says Giovanni Vaccaro, Glasmsquad\xe2\x80\x99s creative director. \xe2\x80\x9cA cotton-based towel causes friction on the hair, and it's more prone to damaging the strands to the point where the hair breaks off,\xe2\x80\x9d he explains.\n\nIf you want to get rid of excess water, Vaccaro recommends using a microfiber towel like the Aquis or an old, clean t-shirt. And still, only spend about 10 minutes with your head wrapped up post-shampoo.\n\nThe best thing for your hair\xe2\x80\x99s health is actually letting it air-dry before blow-drying. \xe2\x80\x9cHair is in its most vulnerable state when wet, so allowing it to air-dry is always the healthiest option,\xe2\x80\x9d explains Vaccaro.\n\nMake sure to dry your hair according to your texture. Vaccaro says that fine-to-medium hair can air-dry a bit longer, to about 80 percent dryness, whereas thicker hair should only be about 50 percent dry before blow-drying. That\xe2\x80\x99s because you have a better chance of getting curly or full hair straight while it\xe2\x80\x99s still a little damp.\n\nIf you have curly or wavy hair and want to enhance your natural texture, add product when it\xe2\x80\x99s very wet, squeeze out the excess with your hands, and wrap it up gently in a microfiber towel or t-shirt. Once your curls stop dripping, you can start blow-drying.\n\n3. You start in with the brush too soon.\n\nOn the opposite side of the 30-minute towel turban faux paus is taking a round brush to sopping wet hair. It\xe2\x80\x99s bad form to immediately walk out of the shower and pick up your blow-dryer and round brush for a blowout. T3 celebrity stylist David Lopez suggests using a dryer to rough dry hair first. Set it to medium heat and low speed. \xe2\x80\x9cIf hair is very wet and put on high speed, then it gets whipped around a lot,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cThis can cause split ends, tangles, and frizz.\xe2\x80\x9d Once hair is about 80 percent dry from the rough dry, then you can start sectioning it, molding it, and styling it with a round brush.\n\n4. You forget to spray heat protectant on the back of your head.\n\nUsing the right product pre-blowout is going to save your ends from breakage and make your blowout last longer. But make sure you\xe2\x80\x99re applying it correctly."""
"b'Ever since Making A Murderer thrust the true-crime boom into the spotlight, the armchair sleuth has never been so spoilt. With cold-cases being reopened via shocking documentaries, or a famous case being reevaluated via a deep-dive podcast, there\xe2\x80\x99s a hot-take available for every unsolved or controversial case.\n\nHere\xe2\x80\x99s the nine documentaries and podcasts you need to throw yourself into.\n\nThe Jinx\n\nWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the case? New York property heir Robert Durst was accused of being involved of several disappearances of close acquaintances. His wife Kathleen McCormack Durst disappeared in 1982, while close friend Susan Berman was killed decades later in 2000. The case that this doc focuses on his alleged involvement with the killing and dismemberment of neighbour Morris Black a year later, in 2001.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy it\xe2\x80\x99s worth a watch? It has a rare caveat for true crime docs \xe2\x80\x93 it directly interviews the criminal involved. In The Jinx, Durst sits down with director Andrew Jarecki to talk through the cases. It results in a jaw-dropping finale that\xe2\x80\x99ll chill you to your very core.\n\nWhere to watch? All episodes on NOW TV or Sky Boxsets.\n\nThe Keepers\n\nWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the case? In 1969, Sister Cathy Cesnik body was found near a garbage dump in a Baltimore suburb and her murder has never been explained. However former students suggest that Cathy may have become suspicious of alleged sexual abuse of students by a priest also teaching at the school she worked at.\n\nWhy it\xe2\x80\x99s worth a watch? The story jumps from present day to the time of the crime with ease, and shines a close light on sexual abuse in the Catholic church and its far-reaching implications.\n\nWhere to watch? All episodes on Netflix.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDirty John\n\nWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the case? After meeting John Meehan on a internet dating website, Debra Newell and her family are dragged into the renegade surgeon\xe2\x80\x99s crazy life, which involves deceit, emotional abuse and eventually, a murder.\n\nWhy it\xe2\x80\x99s worth a listen? The Newell family are forthcoming in their involvement with Meehan \xe2\x80\x93 aka Dirty John \xe2\x80\x93 and the investigative reporting of LA journalist Christopher Goffard unravels the story of a truly terrifying mean\n\nWhere to listen? Available on all major podcast apps.\n\nThe Staircase\n\nWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the case? Novelist Michael Peterson is charged of the murder of his wife, Kathleen Peterson, despite his claims that she fell down the family home\xe2\x80\x99s staircase. The prosecution alleged that he bludgeoned her to death, instead.\n\nWhy it\xe2\x80\x99s worth a watch? Unprecedented access and insight into Peterson and his lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s defence team, but despite the relationship forged between viewer and Peterson, the documentary is careful to show both sides of the court case.\n\nWhere to watch? All episodes are available on Netflix.\n\nSerial\n\nWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the case? In Season 1, Sarah Koenig and the team investigate the disappearance of Hae Min Lee and the subsequent arrest and trial of Adnan Syed. Season 2 takes a different course, telling the story of US army deserter Bowe Bergdahl, while Season 3 examines the faults of the US\xe2\x80\x99 criminal justice system. All very different strands, but equally engrossing.\n\nWhat it\xe2\x80\x99s worth a listen? Arguably the reason by recent years\xe2\x80\x99 True Crime boom, the team\xe2\x80\x99s attention to detail brings every little detail under review, and it\xe2\x80\x99s serialised (geddit?) format allows the team to tell the story with nuance and clarity.\n\nWhere to listen? Available on all major podcast apps.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TlJsW4Eb6o\n\nAmanda Knox\n\nWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the case? In 2007, Briton Meredith Kercher was found dead in US student Amanda Knox in Italy. Knox was subsequently tried and imprisoned by Italian authorities for four years, but was released in 2011. The court case was highly controversial for its subject matter, police tactics and the media coverage.\n\nWhy it\xe2\x80\x99s worth a watch? We hear the Knox side of the story, for what feels like the first time. Handling the gruesome murder carefully, the documentary assesses what it\xe2\x80\x99s like to be falsely imprisoned for a crime like murder, and how Knox fought to clear her name.\n\nWhere to watch? Available on Netflix\n\nUntold\n\nWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the case? Private Investigator Daniel Morgan is murdered in a pub car park in South London in 1987. He was, allegedly, hot on the tail of a set of corrupt police officers and preparing to tell his story when he was killed.\n\nWhy it\xe2\x80\x99s worth a listen? In one fell swoop, journalist Peter Jukes and Alistair Morgan, Daniel\xe2\x80\x99s brother, discuss the alleged Met Police cover up, drug trafficking and the newspaper phone hacking scandal. It\xe2\x80\x99s a brutal and staggering listen that makes for a very British injustice.\n\nWhere to listen? Available on all major podcast apps.\n\nEvil Genius\n\nWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the case? In 2003, a \xe2\x80\x98botched\xe2\x80\x99 bank robbery resulted in the death of Brian Wells. His death was a part of a larger plan that was hatched by Marjorie Diehl-Armstrong and Kenneth Barnes. The FBI would later call it one of \xe2\x80\x9cone of the most complicated and bizarre crimes in the annals of the FBI\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\nWhy it\xe2\x80\x99s worth a watch? There\xe2\x80\x99s likely never been a case quite as complex, diabolical and intriguing as this one. That Trey Borzillieri and Barbara Schroeder managed to condense it into 4 breathless episodes might just be a minor miracle.\n\nWhere to watch? Available on Netflix\n\nIn The Dark (series 2)\n\nWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the case? Curtis Flowers has been tried six times for a crime he says he didn\xe2\x80\x99t commit. Currently on death row for the murder of three people back in 1996, he\xe2\x80\x99s won countless appeals but still the DA in his hometown of Winona tries the case again and again. A personal vendetta? It certainly looks that way.\n\nWhat it\xe2\x80\x99s worth a listen? The level of injustice uncovered by APM reports is astonishing as is trying to imagine what Curtis has been through over the last 21 years.\n\nWhere to listen? All major podcast apps'"

The men are the gangsters, but us, the molls, we use our wiles, our cunning, a hand on an elbow, a whisper in an ear, to manage things from behind the scenes. \xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 Hermione to Veronica[src]\n\n\n\nHermione Apollonia Lodge (n\xc3\xa9e Gomez) was initially a main character on The CW\'s Riverdale. She has since been demoted to recurring for the fifth season onward.[2] She is portrayed by Marisol Nichols.\n\nHermione is the ex-wife of Hiram Lodge and the mother of Veronica Lodge. She had a brief affair with Fred Andrews, but, their relationship ended when Hermione revealed that she was the buyer of the SoDale project.\n\nDuring her husband\'s incarceration, Hermione and their daughter were forced to leave New York and move back to her hometown Riverdale, during which time she attempted to turn Lodge Industries, their family business, into a legitimate company. However, upon Hiram\'s release, he regained control of the company. Since then, in an effort to assist Hiram in over seeing his master plan to monopolize Riverdale, Hermione has become Mayor of Riverdale. However, as things progressed, Hermione and Hiram no longer shared the same goals and she tried to have him killed twice. Unfortunately, she failed, and this resulted in their separation and subsequent marriage annulment. She was then taken into custody for attempted murder, during which time she was removed as mayor.\n\nCharacter Description\n\nHermione has now returned to Riverdale, eager to start afresh with her daughter following the scandalous incarceration of her husband.[3]\n\nEarly Life\n\nHermione grew up in Riverdale, her mother was a maid who worked at the Five Seasons and during that time, Hermione would go on to date Fred Andrews. Throughout her high school years, Hermione worked at local businesses such as the Bijou and Spiffany\'s.[1] During her youth, some would have described Hermione as a mean girl. She even believes her current misfortune was karma finally catching up to her. After she broke up with Fred, she married Hiram Lodge and the two moved to New York City. Together they had a daughter, Veronica. After Hiram was arrested for fraud and embezzlement, Hermione and Veronica left New York City and moved back to Riverdale. After the scandal, the only remaining property that was not seized because it was in Hermione\'s name was the luxurious apartment building, the Pembrooke, where she currently resides with her daughter.\n\nThroughout Riverdale\n\nPhysical Appearance\n\nHermione Lodge is a gorgeous middle-aged woman who possesses a sun-kissed complexion, calculating brown eyes, and luxuriant thick, wavy black hair. She is of average height, approximating 5\'4"" with a narrow and attractive build. She wears elegant, stylish and expensive looking clothes, in a minimalist style which allows her to perfectly embody the look of a chic, well put together business woman.\n\nFormerly she wore the standard Pop\'s Chock\'lit Shoppe employee uniform, before Fred Andrews hired her at Andrews Construction as his bookkeeper.\n\nPersonality\n\nHermione is a strong and confident, independent woman. She\'s also fairly intelligent, furthering along her plan to turn Lodge Industries into a legitimate business, leaving the Blossoms to wonder if they should have gotten her arrested instead of Hiram. While Hermione is a loving and caring mother, willing to do anything for Veronica, she\'s not so faithful as a wife. During Hiram\'s incarceration, she was having a secret love affair with Fred Andrews, up until he broke it off. Hermione also has hopes to regain that luxurious and expensive lifestyle that her family once lived, the lifestyle that she loved so much and had grown accustomed to.\n\nHermione is also very manipulative, while also being dishonest in order to accomplish the goal ahead of her. She lied about writing the blackmail letter threatening herself, claiming that it came from her when in fact it actually came from Hiram. She appears to be in league with him, sharing the same goals and ruthlessness when it comes to business. However, it becomes apparent that Hermione is only in league with herself, appointing FP as Sheriff and hiring him to kill Hiram only to later frame FP for the shooting.\n\nRelationships\n\nMain article: Hermione and Veronica\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c You\'re playing with fire, I want you to know. \xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 Hermione to Veronica about Hiram[src]\n\n\n\n\n\nThe relationship between Hermione and Veronica Lodge, so far, has been quite strong, they have shown to deeply care about each other, even though they have been known to fight on occasions. Their relationship may have developed over the course of the first season, however, since Hiram\'s return to Riverdale, Hermione has been antagonizing and taunting Veronica whenever she gets the chance. Before moving back to Riverdale, they both lived in New York City since Veronica\'s birth, along with Hiram Lodge, Hermione\'s husband and Veronica\'s father. After Hiram was arrested for fraud and embezzlement and subsequently incarcerated, Hermione and Veronica left New York City and moved back to her home town of Riverdale.\n\n\n\nMain article: Hermione and Hiram\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c If you want to burn your relationship with our daughter, that\'s your business. But don\'t ever try to poison her against me. \xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 Hiram to Hermione[src]\n\n\n\n\n\nHiram and Hermione were both raised in Riverdale, where they lived for most of there lives, and attended school together at Riverdale High School. They later married each other and moved to New York City, where they had there first and only child, daughter Veronica. However, shortly before the start of the series, Hiram was arrested and charged with multiple counts of embezzlement and fraud and subsequently incarcerated. While awaiting his trial, Hermione moved herself and her daughter back to her home town of Riverdale. After Hiram was released, he returned to his home town, Riverdale, where he took up residence at The Pembrooke, However, the relationship between the husband and wife has become quite complicated due to Hiram\'s past business deals, resulting in his imprisonment. However, when it comes down to business, they both work well with each other in accomplishing their goals.\n\nIn Chapter Sixty-Three: Hereditary, after getting out of prison after overcoming heated arguments, they are going to renew their vows again.\n\n\n\nMain article: Fred and Hermione\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c I didn\'t call the police because I don\'t trust them, I don\'t trust half the people in this damn town. Just you. \xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 Hermione to Fred[src]\n\n\n\n\n\nThe relationship between Fred and Hermione goes way back, both grew up in Riverdale and attended high school together, where they dated briefly before Hermione left him for the rich kid, Hiram Lodge. When she returned to Riverdale over a decade later, following the arrest of her husband, she and Fred rekindled their romance. However the relationship was ended by Fred the second time after learning that Hermione and Hiram were the anonymous buyers of the SoDale project. Though Hermione appears to still care for Fred, and his well-being. However, she is more interested in securing herself, as well as her relationship with Hiram, after he was recently released from prison and returned to Riverdale.\n\n\n\nPenelope and Hermione grew up in Riverdale together. They\'ve been rivals since the two of them were students at Riverdale High School, and that rivalry continues on to this very day. The two rarely cross paths with each other, but when they do, it\'s hardly ever a pleasant exchange. They are also part of two of the wealthiest families in Riverdale. Their families have also had a past business deal with each other, up until Hiram Lodge\'s arrest.\n\n\n\nHermione and Alice\'s relationship dates back to their adolescents, with both of them growing up in Riverdale. The two were rivals while students at Riverdale High School. A rivalry that proved lasting once Hermione moved back into town with her daughter, Veronica Lodge, after many years of living in New York. Even though the two ladies may have there differences, with Alice being judgmental towards others, Hermione was more than willing to put their differences aside, when she invited Alice to accompany her at Pop\'s Chock\'lit Shoppe, while she discussed Polly\'s Baby shower.\n\n\n\nHermione was possibly friends with Mary Andrews when they were friends in high school. The history between the two of them is remains unknown at the moment, but Mary\'s willingness to invite Hermione to accompany her and Fred at the Homecoming suggest some form of peaceful coexistence.\n\n\n\nAppearances\n\nGallery\n\nHermione Lodge\'s Gallery Can Be Found Here .

"b'[This story contains spoilers from the series finale of A&E\'s Bates Motel.]\n\nAfter five seasons, numerous deaths and a dark decent into madness, the world of A&E\'s Bates Motel came to a close Monday with an expected yet heartbreaking series finale.\n\nIn \xe2\x80\x9cThe Cord,\xe2\x80\x9d the death toll continued to rise. Romero (Nestor Carbonell) fulfilled his death wish when he forced ""Norman"" (Freddie Highmore) to show him where he\'d left Norma\xe2\x80\x99s (Vera Farmiga) body. Only Norman \xe2\x80\x94 who was still ""Mother"" at that point \xe2\x80\x94 killed Romero as he was sobbing over Norma\'s corpse.\n\nBut before Romero breathed his last breath, he reminded Norman of his actions \xe2\x80\x94 that he was the one responsible for killing his beloved mother. As a result, \xe2\x80\x9cMother\xe2\x80\x9d left Norman behind, saying he no longer needed her now that he knew everything. It was enough to send Norman into a lonely tailspin and revert his damaged mind all the way back to the time of the pilot, when he and Norma first traveled to White Pine Bay and opened their infamous motel.\n\nHoping against hope for everything to revert back to normal, Norman dragged his mother\xe2\x80\x99s body to the motel and into the house and called his brother Dylan (Max Thieriot) to come over for dinner as though nothing had happened. In the end, Dylan knew that he was the only one left standing who cared about Norman\xe2\x80\x99s well-being and opted not to call the authorities. Instead, Dylan attempted to bring Norman in himself.\n\nUnfortunately, the only thing Norman wanted in the end was to be reunited with his mother, even if it meant he had to die. So in a twisted suicide attempt, Norman rushed at a gun-wielding Dylan with a knife, forcing his brother to shoot and kill him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you,\xe2\x80\x9d Norman muttered as his last words as Dylan held his dying brother.\n\nTo break down the series finale and what went into crafting the ultimate ending, The Hollywood Reporter caught up with co-showrunners Cartlon Cuse and Kerry Ehrin.\n\nHow much of this was the ending you planned from the start? How much changed over the years?\n\nEhrin: We\xe2\x80\x99d always thought of this as a love story. A very weird, warped, dark, love story. In the end, it felt like even if we were reuniting them in death that they had to be reunited. Even if it was lying next to each other in earth for all eternity. That was the driving destination emotionally. The Dylan story became part of that, and him being the one that ushers Norman out of the world felt fitting.\n\nCuse: We came to the idea later that Dylan would be the one to usher Norman out of the world at Norman\xe2\x80\x99s bequest. But from when we first started talking about the show, we imagined a five-year journey that would end with Norman and Norma both dead. Ultimately, we felt their love story could just not succeed in this world.\n\nAre viewers meant to feel as though Norman wanted Dylan to kill him?\n\nCuse: He\xe2\x80\x99s coming at Dylan with a knife; I mean, Dylan doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have a choice.\n\nEhrin: He wants to be put out of his misery at that point. When Norman goes over to the sink and picks up the knife, you can see all these ideas playing in his head of what he\xe2\x80\x99s supposed to do now that he\xe2\x80\x99s been told that Norma is dead; she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t exist, and he\xe2\x80\x99s not going to get her back, and there\xe2\x80\x99s no pretending your way out of this. It\xe2\x80\x99s a beautiful performance, because you see all these things play through him. He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t quite know what he\xe2\x80\x99s doing when he picks up the knife and starts walking toward Dylan. He\xe2\x80\x99s working it out as he\xe2\x80\x99s walking.\n\nCuse: It\xe2\x80\x99s always a bit of a double-edged sword to talk about stuff afterward. It\xe2\x80\x99s fine for people to have their own interpretation of what happened at the end. Most of the audience will have that experience. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t intentionally ambiguous, but you can draw your own line and make a decision as to what degree Norman is egging him on and to what degree can Dylan stop himself. There was a certain messy, tragic quality to that final encounter that we love.\n\nEhrin: Messy tragedy has been our hallmark. We like to not over-define things. We like to throw it out there and wade around it.\n\nWere you going for an Of Mice and Men vibe?\n\nEhrin: Yes. That\xe2\x80\x99s dead on. That was definitely an inspiration in early discussions. The idea of a mercy killing that was also heartbreaking.\n\nCuse: There\xe2\x80\x99s a poignancy in Norman having a brief moment of clarity that gives him perspective. If you think of the distorted mental state Norman is in when he invites Dylan to come to dinner and has Norma kind of propped up on the table, there was a real poignancy in having Norman realize that all avenues were closed to him. He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to go to a mental institution, he can\xe2\x80\x99t exist in this world, he\xe2\x80\x99s in a degrading mental state. There was no other solution for him.\n\nWhy didn\xe2\x80\x99t Emma (Olivia Cooke) call the police when she knew Dylan was going into the house?\n\nEhrin: She actually did in one draft. It was an editing decision in post. Once you get Dylan into that house, you just wanted to stay with him and be with that and not cut away to something else.\n\nCuse: It\xe2\x80\x99s fair in a situation like this that characters don\xe2\x80\x99t always do the most logical thing. Obviously, if Emma calls the cops, it really mutes the conclusion that we felt was best for the show, and it felt fair and reasonable that in that moment she defers and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t do it.\n\nOnce you introduced Marion Crane (Rihanna), were Norman\xe2\x80\x99s days numbered?\n\nCuse: There were a couple of guiding principles. We absolutely did not want to end the show in the same way as Psycho. That would have been a profound disappointment and it would deflate the whole intention here, which was to take characters and some of the iconographic imagery from the movie and tell its own story. Our story had its own ending, and so we enjoyed the fun of crossing in and out of the mythology of Psycho at the end. Particularly when we cast Rihanna, we leaned into the fact that the audience would come to it with these very specific expectations based on the movie, and we wanted to flip their expectations on their ear. That was fun to do, but as far as the ending goes, we were never judging it against the ending in Psycho or felt an obligation to connect it to the ending of Psycho. Our obligation at the end was to hopefully have this tragic love story come to a satisfying ending. Sad can be satisfying. We knew it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be happy, but we hoped it would be satisfying.\n\nPsycho aside, was there any point where you second-guessed your decision to kill Norman?\n\nEhrin: No. Certainly a part of you wants to somehow have everything turn out OK just because you love the characters. But this is closer to Wuthering Heights than Harvey. There\xe2\x80\x99s an ending where Norman just walks off into the hills talking to his mother and the sun goes down and everyone\xe2\x80\x99s happy. In my head, that kind of exists, but that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t what we were delivering.\n\nWhen Norma leaves Norman following Romero\xe2\x80\x99s death, does that close the door on his mental defense case in these murders?\n\nEhrin: Yes, because he\xe2\x80\x99s alone. He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have that buffer anymore, and he can\xe2\x80\x99t deal with it. It pushes him over the edge, and it leads him on this journey to recall the past and kind of redo it.\n\nHow did you come up with the idea to reincorporate the pilot into the episode?\n\nCuse: One of the things that\xe2\x80\x99s always satisfying in finales is to remind audiences of the journey they\xe2\x80\x99ve been on. There\xe2\x80\x99s a resonance in rewarding an audience that has watched all 50 episodes of our show with a sense of that journey. Some of it arose from those feelings. It was also a way to make the love story feel epic. The thing that makes something epic is its existence across a large spread of time. We wanted to reconnect the audience to the fact that this love story and relationship was a lifelong journey.\n\nWhen did you decide that Dylan, Emma and their daughter would live in the sun?\n\nEhrin: That instinct first came at the end of the second season.\n\nCuse: We realized the show was heading in a very dark direction, and we felt it was important to have some ray of hope at the end of our narrative. It became clear that early that Dylan and Emma deserved to come out of this with a relatively happy ending.\n\nEhrin: There was something really interesting toward the end of the second season to have these two people who were both really outside of the Norma-Norman island and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get on it, that they would find each other and miraculously make their own world together. It made us happy to think about, and it became something that was fun to work toward in the writing. You do try to balance it \xe2\x80\x94 even on a purely selfish level for your own self. When you\xe2\x80\x99re living inside of this stuff, it\xe2\x80\x99s very dark, and it\xe2\x80\x99s nice to have strands of hope to hold onto. That played out even in writing Norma and Norman, because you would constantly have to put yourself in denial about the ending. You wanted to always infuse them with hope that things would be better. That they were going to work out of it. It\xe2\x80\x99s an interesting process to write that. It\xe2\x80\x99s very emotionally and physically taxing\xe2\x80\xa6it\'s bizarre.\n\nWas there any talk of having that last shot be the daughter giving the camera a creepy Norman Bates-type smile, rather than ending it on a happier note?\n\nCuse: That will be the sequel.\n\nEhrin: We joked about that in the writers\' room, that she would be like Baby Norma, but that she would be evil. But no. The kid is good, and Dylan and Emma are good.\n\nWhat did you think of the series finale of Bates Motel? Sound off in the comments below.

Marlene King commented on these rumors to TVLine as she said ""We have enough story to take us to the end of Season 7, and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to let the fans tell us if they\xe2\x80\x99re ready to say goodbye to this world and these characters.""[40] She confirmed to being open for an eighth season and a movie and a new book.[41]\n\nIn an interview with Variety regarding the five-year time-jump from the sixth season, King said ""I think that this story when we\'re back will end next year at the end of Season 7"". She later took to Twitter where she confirmed that the current storyline that began in the second half of the sixth season would end after the seventh season, but would not necessarily mean that the show would end after the seventh season.[42][43] Hale said on The Late Late Show with James Corden that the show was ending after the seventh season.[44] Bellisario\'s fianc\xc3\xa9 Patrick J. Adams said in June 2016, that the show was ending in 2017, as the couple has decided to get married after the show ends.[45] Freeform gave out a statement not long after saying that ""There has been no official decision made for PLL beyond a season 7.""[46] It was announced on August 29, 2016, the day before the mid-season finale would air, that Pretty Little Liars will end after the seventh season.[4]\n\nFilming [ edit ]\n\nProduction began on February 1, 2016, when King announced on Twitter that the writers were in full swing brainstorming and mapping the seventh season.[47][48] Production and filming began in the end of March 2016 and officially wrapped up in October 2016.[6][49]\n\nCasting [ edit ]\n\nThe seventh season has nine roles receiving star billing, with eight of them returning from the previous season, six of which was part of the original cast from the first season. The season saw the four protagonists of the series continue the roles as they try to take down the new \'A\'. Troian Bellisario played Spencer Hastings, who has relationship problems with Caleb, while Ashley Benson played Hanna Marin, who was kidnapped at the end of last season. Lucy Hale continued her role as Aria Montgomery as she is set in a love triangle with Ezra and her boyfriend Liam. Shay Mitchell portrayed Emily Fields who begins to rekindle her relationship with Alison. Sasha Pieterse continued to portray Alison DiLaurentis as Alison struggles with being in a psych-ward. Janel Parrish returned as Mona Vanderwaal who seems to be finally on their side. Tyler Blackburn continues to play Caleb Rivers and Ian Harding also continued his role as Ezra Fitz. Andrea Parker was added as a series regular, playing Jessica DiLaurentis\' twin sister Mary Drake.\n\nAfter the sixth-season finale, it was announced that Andrea Parker would return to the show as Mary Drake, Jessica DiLaurentis\' identical twin sister and biological mother to Charlotte DiLaurentis.[50] TVLine later confirmed that Parker was added as a series regular for the upcoming season.[51] Deadline reported on May 10, 2016, that actor Nicholas Gonzalez was cast as Detective Vic Furey, a character who will oversee the Rosewood Police Department.[52] The character was later renamed Det. Marco Furey.[53] Tammin Sursok announced that she will return to the show as Jenna Marshall after last appearing in the fifth-season episode ""How the \'A\' Stole Christmas"".[54] On June 2, 2016, Variety reported that Brant Daugherty would be returning as Noel Kahn; Brant has not appeared on the show since the beginning of the fifth season.[55]\n\nOn June 10, 2016, The Hollywood Reporter reported that Lindsey Shaw would be returning as Paige McCullers after leaving in the fifth season mid-season premiere.[56] The actress playing Sydney Driscoll, Chloe Bridges, posted an image on social media, confirming that she would return to the show after last appearing in the Christmas special episode.[57] On July 28, 2016, The Hollywood Reporter reported that Shane Coffey would be returning as Holden Strauss; Shane has not appeared on the show since the beginning of the third season.[58] It was announced on August 8, 2016, that Ava Allan will appear on the show, and will first appear in the second half of the season as Addison.[59] On August 17, 2016, TVLine reported that Edward Kerr would be returning to the show as Pastor Ted Wilson in the second half of the season.

"b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe Flash\xe2\x80\x9d returns this week after a month-long hiatus with Barry (Grant Gustin) making a dangerous play to learn the identity of Savitar.\n\nAfter an encounter with future villain Abra Kadabra (David Dastmalchian) \xe2\x80\x94 who not only knew a future version of Flash, but also who Savitar was \xe2\x80\x94 Barry decides the best way to learn more about the God of Speed is to head to the future himself. On top of all that, Caitlin (Danielle Panabaker) has succumbed to her Killer Frost persona and is on the run. All of this is juggled by first-time \xe2\x80\x9cFlash\xe2\x80\x9d director, and series\xe2\x80\x99 star, Tom Cavanagh.\n\nVariety spoke with Cavanagh \xe2\x80\x94 who has played three separate versions of the same character across the show\xe2\x80\x99s three seasons; currently H.R. Wells, and previously Harry Wells and Harrison Wells \xe2\x80\x94 about directing different versions of the main characters, how being behind the camera this time differed from his previous directing gigs, and more.\n\nHow did directing an episode come about? Was it something you wanted to do or did they approach you about it?\n\nGenerally, when I am signing a contract for a television series, we have a handshake deal in there about directing. This is my third show for Greg Berlanti, and they sort of know I like to direct. In the past the stuff that I\xe2\x80\x99ve done seems to have been well-enough received that it allowed me to forge forth.\n\nDid you know when you said you\xe2\x80\x99d direct that it would be this big Barry-heads-to-the-future episode?\n\nThey do a ridiculous amount of episodes of \xe2\x80\x9cFlash\xe2\x80\x9d every year. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Flash\xe2\x80\x9d is one of the most prepared television shows I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever been on, and for the amount of work that comes through the pipeline they are incredibly on top of it. As a director \xe2\x80\x94 I\xe2\x80\x99ve been on shows where the director gets the script on the first day of shooting \xe2\x80\x94 they will get a script for the entire length of the prep. It gives you a fighting chance.\n\nIn terms of what the actual story is going to be, they\xe2\x80\x99ve got a story arc when they start the season but you don\xe2\x80\x99t really know where your story is going to fall. I feel very fortunate to deal with Barry \xe2\x80\xa6 dealing with Barry. That\xe2\x80\x99s two versions of Grant Gustin, which is phenomenal. I was grateful to have this storyline.\n\nYou\xe2\x80\x99re no stranger of playing multiple versions of the same character, or acting opposite yourself. Was it fun directing altered, future versions of the other characters?\n\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s part of the aspect of this episode that I really, really liked. We see a whole different world. We got to mess some stuff up. I\xe2\x80\x99ve played five or six or seven different versions of myself since the show started but most of the cast has just played one or two versions of their character. In this one, I think it was great for them to pull out of the hat another version of themselves. I think both Grant and Carlos Valdes in particular were exceptional in this episode. They\xe2\x80\x99re very talented to begin with, but then you add these different layers you kind of marvel at their abilities.\n\nHow is it to direct yourself?\n\nI always find it\xe2\x80\x99s really good. If you write something and you have the visual of that in your head, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have to convince the actor \xe2\x80\x94 or even explain to the actor \xe2\x80\x94 what the visual is. So I can accommodate however I want. One thing I will say, though, if anyone is going to get short-changed when I\xe2\x80\x99m directing it\xe2\x80\x99s not going to be the other actors; it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be me. You become much less self-indulgent.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Flash\xe2\x80\x9d airs on the CW on Tuesdays at 8 p.m.'"

""I literally don\'t look like this!""\n\nSome people body-shamed Kim\'s cellulite in April when the photos first appeared.\n\nAlthough Kim reacted with a body-positive tweet calling her body ""flawless,"" she later claimed on ""The View"" that the pictures were Photoshopped to look ""worse.""\n\n\n\nIn April, Kim Kardashian West went on vacation in Mexico to celebrate her sister Kourtney\'s birthday. Paparazzi photos of Kim at the beach quickly surfaced online, prompting some people to criticize the reality TV star\'s cellulite.\n\nA teaser for this week\'s upcoming episode of ""Keeping Up With the Kardashians"" shows Kim reacting to the photos after her former assistant and Kardashian West Brands COO Stephanie Shepherd came across them on her phone.\n\n""Oh my god,"" Kim said, as she looked at the photos while lounging by the pool with her friends. ""Like, I don\'t get it! Like, I literally don\'t look like this!""\n\nSpeaking directly to the camera, the 36-year-old ""KUWTK"" star elaborated on her reaction.\n\n""I\'m already having this anxiety attack over security, and I\'m already just, like, on high alert and now paparazzi\'s found us, it\'s like just the scrutiny that we get all the time, we try to avoid that,"" she said. ""I\'m doing all the steps to try to be as private and discreet as possible and then you take pictures. And if they\'re not, like, perfect people just, like, body-shame you. [...] For people to just think that\'s OK is so frustrating.""\n\nKim then goes inside to ""untag"" herself in all the pictures that have been posted.\n\nWatch the clip, which we first saw on E! News, below:\n\nWhen the photos first appeared, Kim had a very different public reaction to the comments about the photos, sending a body-positive tweet that appeared to rise above the criticism she received.\n\nAlthough Kim\'s initial response was celebrated, she was criticized for claiming that the pictures were Photoshopped on ""The View"" in June. In the same interview, she said that the photos encouraged her to start working out more.\n\n""I saw these awful photos of myself when I was on a trip in Mexico and people were Photoshopping them and sharpening them, and they\'re the worst photos,"" she said during her appearance on the TV show. ""I definitely was not in my best shape. I hadn\'t worked out in about 12 weeks.""\n\nShe continued: ""I was already not feeling like myself and then when people were like sharpening [the photos] and making them look way worse, and then those were going around, I was like \'OK, I\'m going to get it together.\'""\n\nOf course, Photoshopped or not, cellulite is a totally normal part of a woman\'s body. As for Kim\'s reaction to the pictures, we\'ll have to wait until the next episode of ""KUWTK"" to see more.\n\n""Keeping Up With the Kardashians"" airs Sunday\'s on E! 9 p.m. ET.\n\nWant more?

"b""Emma Stone and Jennifer Lawrence became friends by texting each other every day until they got drunk on cheap wine together, and it turns out they include Brie Larson, too.\n\nLarson spoke with Vanity Fair for its May issue about her friendships with the other A-list actresses, revealing that the trio has become each other\xe2\x80\x99s support system through a group text\xe2\x80\x94which also happens to include Lena Dunham and Amy Schumer. (It keeps getting better.)\n\nThe actress explained that she began to rely on the women during the grueling and uncomfortable process of promoting her Oscar-winning work in Room. \xe2\x80\x9cI felt lonely and bad sometimes. I was embarrassed to keep talking about myself,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\n\nAn unexpected but \xe2\x80\x9cbeautiful\xe2\x80\x9d email from Stone and a text from Lawrence, turned into powerful relationships.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat [group of friends] saved my life,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI was able to talk with them about everything that was going on in my life, and it was with people who had been through it before and are also hilarious. That support and acceptance was everything. I was home-schooled, so I didn\xe2\x80\x99t have friends that had the same interests as me, and I found it to be absolutely incredible.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRelated Videos\n\nThis isn\xe2\x80\x99t the first time Larson has gushed about her celebrity comrades. After the 2017 Academy Awards, Larson posted a picture to Instagram of her embracing a tearful Stone. But the duo\xe2\x80\x99s cute Oscars behavior extends back even farther than this year. Larson revealed to Vanity Fair that last year, when she was nominated, Stone gave her a good luck card alongside a gift: the book I Can Fly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s those little things,\xe2\x80\x9d Larson said of Stone\xe2\x80\x99s gesture.\n\nLarson also opened up about getting to know Lawrence, whom she met through costar Woody Harrelson, who had likewise introduced Stone and Lawrence. Larson explained that she and Lawrence happened to be in Montreal at the same time, and hung out every week.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe just had a blast together, going to get dinner every Saturday night. It gave us all a chance to connect,\xe2\x80\x9d Larson said.\n\nHarrelson also praised the group of actresses, calling them \xe2\x80\x9ca very tight-knit group who keep them honest and keep their ego in check.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd with Larson recently snagging the coveted titular role in Captain Marvel\xe2\x80\x94the first female-led Marvel superhero film\xe2\x80\x94it seems Larson will be needing those friends by her side more than ever.

"b""NBC\xe2\x80\x99s new sitcom \xe2\x80\x9cGreat News\xe2\x80\x9d is something of a family affair.\n\nThe Tina Fey-produced workplace comedy centers on Katie Wendelson (Briga Heelan), a 30-year-old producer at New Jersey-based cable news show \xe2\x80\x9cThe Breakdown,\xe2\x80\x9d whose overly involved mother, Carol (Andrea Martin), decides to take an internship at her daughter\xe2\x80\x99s office.\n\nIts central mother-daughter story is based on creator Tracey Wigfield\xe2\x80\x99s close relationship with her own mother, Kathy, who lives in Wayne, NJ, and whom she calls every day. While Kathy never went so far as to intern at one of her daughter\xe2\x80\x99s previous gigs as a writer on \xe2\x80\x9c30 Rock\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cThe Mindy Project,\xe2\x80\x9d Wigfield, 33, says, \xe2\x80\x9cHer personality is very much Carol on the show. She\xe2\x80\x99s outspoken and very much up in my business all the time and checking my thyroid and putting her hand down my shirt.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThat specific boundary-crossing act appears in the two-episode premiere (Tuesday at 9 p.m. on NBC), as do other real-life examples \xe2\x80\x94 helped by the fact that Wigfield\xe2\x80\x99s younger sister, Ashley, is also a writer on the show. Heelan (\xe2\x80\x9cGround Floor\xe2\x80\x9d) plays a slightly younger version of Wigfield, who\xe2\x80\x99s torn between still needing her mother and not wanting to need her \xe2\x80\x94 a role that felt especially relevant to the actress, who is a new mom to a weeks-old daughter with husband Rene Gube.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c[That] was kind of amazing, knowing that I was having a girl when we were filming a mother-daughter show,\xe2\x80\x9d says Heelan, 30. \xe2\x80\x9cBefore this child popped out of me, [I thought] yes, I would never be overbearing like that and I\xe2\x80\x99m not gonna scare her with horrible dramatic things that could happen to her and constantly be hovering or trying to control who she dates. But then when I look at her face now, I\xe2\x80\x99m like, \xe2\x80\x98Girl, I can\xe2\x80\x99t promise you I\xe2\x80\x99m not gonna do any of that crazy stuff.\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have a lot more compassion for mothers everywhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x98Her personality is very much Carol on the show. She\xe2\x80\x99s outspoken and very much up in my business all the time and checking my thyroid and putting her hand down my shirt.\xe2\x80\x99 - Tracey Wigfield on her mother's similarity to 'Great News' character\n\nIn \xe2\x80\x9cGreat News,\xe2\x80\x9d the confidence-challenged Katie soon warms up to the idea of her cheerleader-in-chief mother being around the office, not least because of Carol\xe2\x80\x99s unfiltered way of talking to her superiors. Though Heelan first met her TV mom Martin at their first rehearsal, she also immediately wanted to be around the Broadway legend all the time.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs the daughter, if your mom\xe2\x80\x99s in the room, you feel grounded, you feel comforted by that person and we instantly had that,\xe2\x80\x9d she says. \xe2\x80\x9cEven in social situations, when we weren\xe2\x80\x99t working, if she\xe2\x80\x99s there, I want to be next to her.

"b'Mila Kunis just set the bar high for Mother\'s Day.\n\nThe actress teamed up with the home company Houzz to makeover her parents\' California condo. Not only is the result stunning, but her parents\' reaction has us reaching for the tissues.\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s the home that\xe2\x80\x99s been a steady constant in actress Mila Kunis\xe2\x80\x99s life since she was 9, and because her parents Mark and Elvira never plan to move, she decided it was time to give the condo an upgrade.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe house kind of looks like ""Miami Vice"" circa 1994,\xe2\x80\x9d the ""Bad Moms"" star said in the latest episode of Houzz\xe2\x80\x99s makeover video series, \xe2\x80\x9cMy Houzz.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBesides the outdated interior, the layout needed some work too.

The two worked together to make the area more airy and comfortable for future family gatherings, which would come in handy since Kunis was nine months pregnant at the time.\n\nBut the baby on the way didn\xe2\x80\x99t stop the expecting mom to help tear down a wall.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI might be nine months pregnant, but if anyone is knocking down that wall, it\xe2\x80\x99s me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said in the video.

"b'Ivanka Trump gets booed, hissed at during Berlin event The first daughter was put on the spot during her first trip abroad as a representative of America.\n\nBERLIN \xe2\x80\x94 Ivanka Trump arrived in Berlin on Tuesday morning armed with facts and figures to recite at what was expected to be a highbrow international summit to discuss women\'s entrepreneurship, alongside German Chancellor Angela Merkel.\n\nBut on her first trip abroad as an official representative of the United States, the first daughter was put on the spot about her father\'s attitudes toward women, booed and hissed at by the crowd, and grilled by the moderator about what, exactly, her role is in President Donald Trump\xe2\x80\x99s administration.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re the first daughter of the United States, and you\xe2\x80\x99re also an assistant to the president,\xe2\x80\x9d said the moderator, WirtschaftsWoche editor-in-chief Miriam Meckel. \xe2\x80\x9cThe German audience is not that familiar with the concept of a first daughter. I\xe2\x80\x99d like to ask you, what is your role, and who are you representing, your father as president of the United States, the American people, or your business?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIt was an aggressive opening line of questioning for the first daughter, who was seated next to Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, and one seat down from Merkel. Queen Maxima of the Netherlands was also a participant on the W20 Summit panel, which Ivanka Trump attended at Merkel\'s invitation.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly not the latter,\xe2\x80\x9d Trump said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m rather unfamiliar with this role as well. ... It has been a little under 100 days, and it has just been a remarkable and incredible journey.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShe did not define what her new role as a senior White House official entailed but said she cares ""very much about empowering women in the workplace"" and defined her goal as enacting \xe2\x80\x9cincremental positive change. That is my goal.

Ivanka Trump did not comment on those accusations during the campaign, and on Tuesday she dismissed the criticism via her father\xe2\x80\x99s favorite enemy \xe2\x80\x94 the press.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve certainly heard the criticism from the media, that\xe2\x80\x99s been perpetuated,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, drawing laughs from the audience.\n\nAnd despite being invited to attend the panel by Merkel in her role as a senior White House official, she defended her father from her vantage point of loyal daughter \xe2\x80\x94 in what appeared to be muscle memory from when she was confronted by uncomfortable questions about her father on the campaign.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs a daughter, I can speak on a very personal level,\xe2\x80\x9d Ivanka Trump said. \xe2\x80\x9cI grew up in a house where there was no barrier to what I could accomplish beyond my own perseverance and tenacity. That\xe2\x80\x99s not an easy thing to do; he provided that for us.\xe2\x80\x9d She said that her father treated her exactly the same way he treated her two brothers, who now run the family business. \xe2\x80\x9cThere was no difference,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\n\nTrump also credited her father\xe2\x80\x99s administration for hiring women in important roles.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe team basically going through the vetting and hiring process \xe2\x80\x94 six out of eight of those people are women,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\n\nIvanka Trump and her team touted the summit as a political win, in a question-and-answer session with reporters following the panel, noting that Merkel had announced from the stage her support to work together on a fund to support women entrepreneurs.\n\nBreaking News Alerts Get breaking news when it happens \xe2\x80\x94 in your inbox.

The cast looks good so far, but we wonder who will be tapped to play Scar and Nala.\n\nSources told Variety the film\xe2\x80\x99s director Jon Favreau\xe2\x80\x94the man behind the live-action remake of The Jungle Book\xe2\x80\x94is eyeing the one and only Beyonc\xc3\xa9 for the role of Nala. Considering the movie is now being fast-tracked, it shouldn't be much longer before Disney reveals the rest of the cast.\n\nThe Lion King is scheduled to hit theaters on July 19, 2019."""
"b'Last week, Starbucks introduced the limited-time-only Unicorn Frappuccino, and the interwebs went bonkers. The creation was served only through April 23, but coffee drinkers weren\'t quite ready to let go. Enter the unofficial Starbucks ""Dragon Frappuccino."" If you were bummed to see the Unicorn Frapp make its exit (I mean, who wasn\'t?), you might just love this twist on beverages inspired by mythological creatures.\n\nThe Dragon Frappuccino isn\'t an official menu item, according to a Starbucks spokesperson. Rather, it appears to be a brilliant idea on the part of some creative baristas. Its existence is possible due to the virtually endless customization you can employ when ordering your favorite Sbux drinks. ""In addition to the beverage options listed on our menu boards, there are more than 170,000 ways baristas can customize beverages at Starbucks, including selecting from a variety of milks, syrups, coffee/espresso options, and toppings,"" a Starbucks spokesperson tells Bustle. ""This high level of personalization allows our customers to tailor their drink to match their personal taste preferences."" The Dragon Frappuccino seems to have been born from this ""anything goes"" philosophy, and people are loving it.\n\nThe Unicorn Frappuccino originally came with a stipulation on its availability: You could get it from April 19 through April 23, or as long as supplies lasted. Indeed, it ended up being so popular (because, I mean, look at it) that the ""as long as supplies last"" part proved to be a key factor. Some locations did in fact run out of the ingredients before the April 23 deadline. So someone, somewhere got inventive and came up with what we now call the Dragon Frapp. As one Instagram user put it when attempting to order the Unicorn Frappuccino, ""They were out of the ingredients and offered me something not only cooler and better tasting, but easier to make: The Dragon Frappuccino.""\n\nWhile I honestly don\'t know for sure what\'s in the Dragon Frappuccino, one customer said on Instagram that it was a green tea Frapp with some vanilla bean powder and ""berry cup swirl."" The consensus seems to be that the Dragon Frapp is a little less sweet than the Unicorn Frapp.\n\nHowever, if you want to order one, you\'ll have to get creative. Says a Starbucks spokesperson to Bustle, ""If customers want to order a beverage that is not listed on our menu boards, we recommend they know the recipe so that their barista can handcraft the beverage perfectly for them."" So in other words, don\'t go to a Starbucks, try to order a ""Dragon Frappuccino,"" and expect your barista to know what you mean. Instead, your best bet is to tell the barista that you want a Green Tea Frappuccino with vanilla bean powder blended up into it and a berry swirl in the cup. Once you\'ve got that perfectly customized drink in your hand, you can call it whatever the heck you want \xe2\x80\x94 just have pity on your poor barista and don\'t order an item by a random name that they\'ll likely have no idea about.\n\nWhile the Dragon Frappuccino may be less labor-intensive than its unicorn counterpart, it\'s possible that the swirly purple ingredient is left over from Starbucks unicorn days \xe2\x80\x94 meaning there might be a limited supply. (However, this hasn\'t been confirmed by anyone, so just take it as speculation on my part.) In other words, enjoy the Dragon Frappuccino while you can, folks, because it might peace out eventually.\n\nIt might not be quite as popular as the Unicorn Frapp, but you\'ve got to admit that the Dragon Frapp is still a creative take on the coffee giant\'s trademark drink. One can only imagine what they\'ll think of next. (Mermaid Frapp? Fairy Frapp? Loch Ness Monster Frapp? Just throwing those out there...)'"

"b'Bravo\n\nDorinda Medley threw back one too many cocktails before heading to Puerto Rico to help Bethenny Frankel with her hurricane relief efforts, and it ended in utter disaster.\n\nThe ""Real Housewives of New York"" stars stopped in Miami before taking one of Bethenny\'s jets and all kinds of aid to Puerto Rico to help the victims of Hurricane Maria. The two had some cocktails in Bethenny\'s hotel room and a few before dinner before they met up with the rest of the relief crew. By 7 p.m., Dorinda was wasted.\n\nBethenny was mortified watching Dorinda slur her words, interrupt her friends and make comments like, ""How weird that there\'s an earthquake in Haiti, right?"" and ""Do you think there\'s a constructive action to make it, like, ability to sustain itself?""\n\nBethenny knew Dorinda was drunk, but when she felt Dorinda was questioning the point of going to Puerto Rico in the first place, Bethenny said, ""Maybe you shouldn\'t come tomorrow if you feel so hopeless about it.""\n\nDorinda lost it. She stormed off and told Bethenny, ""You always ruin everything.""\n\nBethenny ended up apologizing to her friends and assuring them that Dorinda would still be coming to Puerto Rico. She told Bravo cams, ""The first feeling that I have is compassion for her, honestly. She won\'t even know what she\'s done. I know she\'ll wake up tomorrow and she\'ll be there on time and dressed and she\'ll have a good experience. And I\'m forgiving.""\n\n""It\'s sad because Dorinda seems to abuse alcohol,"" she continued. ""I would say that acting this way at 7 o\'clock at night to people who only have good intentions would indicate that there might be a problem.""\n\nThe next day on the plane, Bethenny confronted Dorinda, and it was basically an intervention.\n\nBETHENNY: ""I don\'t want you to get your fur up because I\'m gonna be very, very kind. You go to a 16 out of 10, and I need to really say it to you because the way that you sometimes treat me is like worse than Ramona. I just cut you slack because you\'re a drunk.""\n\nDORINDA: ""Well, I\'m not, I just can\'t not eat and then drink. I should\'ve gone to bed last night.""\n\nBETHENNY: ""But it was 7 o\'clock. You shouldn\'t be going to bed at 7 o\'clock.""\n\nDORINDA: ""I know, but I shouldn\'t have drank at 4.\n\nBETHENNY: ""Then you shouldn\'t be drinking, because when you drink, you get mean. There\'s something that goes on. You may be allergic. You can\'t act like that.""\n\nDorinda said she had ""a lot going on"" in her life, but Bethenny counteracted with, ""So does everybody."" She also told Dorinda she was ""scared of her.""\n\n""I don\'t think I\'m an alcoholic,"" Dorinda replied. ""I think I use alcohol as an excuse to sometimes exhibit bad behavior.""\n\nAfter the two chatted for a bit, Dorinda\'s real issue came to the surface: She misses her late husband, Richard, and Bethenny\'s new boyfriend, Dennis, reminds her of him. In fact, she went as far as to say the resemblence triggered that blowout with Sonja Morgan earlier this season.\n\n""I realized sitting with [Dennis] that he\'s so much like [Richard],"" Dorinda said as she began to cry. ""I remember this, and at one point, it was real. And I thought it was forever. I have a life now that\'s not the life that I expected. That\'s why I think what triggered so much when Sonja was saying the thing about her divorce and stuff.""\n\n""Dorinda\'s got Richard on her mind, and I think she\'s chosen a man now that she can be with part time, not someone that she would really be with full time, so she\'s left thinking about her old life,"" Bethenny said of Dorinda\'s current boyfriend, John Mahdessian.\n\nDorinda began to sob as she admitted to feeling like she\'s sliding backward. She told Bethenny she feels like all her ""major jobs"" -- being a wife and being a mom -- ""are kind of over.""\n\n""As bad as it was that Richard passed and all that bologna, I grew so much,"" Dorinda said. ""Like, the person that stood by his coffin is not the person that I am today, and I would have never become that person if he had lived. Not saying that\'s a positive thing, but maybe the person that met John 6 or 7 months after Richard died is not that person today. Maybe that person needs a different sort of partner.""\n\nBethenny agreed: ""I don\'t think you\'re fulfilled in that relationship, I\'ll tell you that.""\n\n""The Real Housewives of New York"" airs Wednesdays at 9 p.m. on Bravo.'"
"b'Scott Baio took to Facebook on Monday, April 24, to retract the comments he made that falsely connected his former Happy Days costar and ex-girlfriend Erin Moran\xe2\x80\x99s death to drug use.\n\nAs Us Weekly previously reported, Moran was found dead in her Indiana home at the age of 56 on Saturday, April 22.

"b'For the Iraqi minister, see Mohammed Hadid\n\nMohamed Anwar Hadid (Arabic: \xd9\x85\xd8\xad\xd9\x85\xd8\xaf \xd8\xad\xd8\xaf\xd9\x8a\xd8\xaf\xe2\x80\x8e; born 6 November 1948)[5][6] is a Jordanian-American real estate developer of Palestinian origin. He is known for building luxury hotels and mansions, mainly in the Bel Air neighborhood of the city of Los Angeles and Beverly Hills in Los Angeles County, California.\n\nEarly life\n\nMohamed Anwar Hadid is a Palestinian[7][8][9] born in Nazareth[1] in November 1948 to a Muslim family. He is the son of Anwar Mohamed Hadid (September 15, 1918[10] \xe2\x80\x93 May 12, 1989[11]) and his wife Khairiah (n\xc3\xa9e Daher; March 15, 1925 \xe2\x80\x93 October 1, 2008)[12]. Through his mother he claims descent from Daher Al Omer, Prince of Nazareth and the Sheik of Galilee.[13][14] Hadid has two brothers and five sisters.[11]\n\nAlong with his family, he fled Palestine during the 1948 Palestinian exodus (Nakba). In 2015, Hadid said that ""We became refugees to Syria and we lost our home in Safad to a Jewish family that we sheltered... Strange thing. That I and my family would do it again.""[15]\n\nHis father studied at a Jerusalem teachers\' college and attended a university[which?] in Syria to study law, before working in land settlement for the British authorities and teaching English at a teachers\' college in Mandatory Palestine. In 1948, he moved to Syria and joined the United States Information Agency and the Voice of America. He and his family lived in Damascus, Tunisia, and Greece before moving to Washington, D.C., as Anwar had a job at the VOA headquarters there, when Mohamed was 14, and spent the rest of his career there with VOA and USIA as a writer, editor and translator.[11][13][16]\n\nHadid attended North Carolina State University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.[1]\n\nCareer\n\nAmong his early ventures was a company that exported equipment to the Middle East.[6][17] He started his career restoring and reselling classic cars in the Georgetown neighborhood of Washington, D.C., before moving to Greece, where he opened a nightclub on an island, and with the profits, started developing real estate back in the United States.[18]\n\nIn the 1980s, much of his financial clout came from the SAAR Foundation, a Herndon-based foundation with Saudi roots. The foundation was a 50\xe2\x80\x9350 partner in many of Hadid\'s ventures.[17] In the late 1980s, he faced at least 30 lawsuits from creditors and banks claiming he had not fulfilled various financial obligations.[19] He paid $150 million for the Ritz-Carlton hotels in Washington and New York. He also converted a Houston hotel into a Ritz-Carlton Hotel and developed a Ritz-Carlton resort in Scottsdale, Arizona. He outmaneuvered Donald Trump, paid $42.9 million for several choice parcels in Aspen and announced plans for a 292-room Ritz resort.[17][19]\n\nIn 1992, a settlement was reached in a lawsuit by Riggs Bank against Columbia First Bank Chairman Melvin Lenkin, a Hadid partner in a Washington, D.C., construction project that involved a loan on which Hadid defaulted. Following the settlement Hadid closed his local office, lost his McLean home to foreclosure, and left the Washington area.[20]\n\nHe developed Le Belvedere, a mansion in Bel Air, Los Angeles,[21] that sold for $50 million in 2010. In 2012, he developed The Crescent Palace, a 48,000-square-foot home on an acre plot next door to the Beverly Hills Hotel, which he listed for sale at $58 million.[22]\n\nShortly after Hadid received approval for the construction of a mansion in Bel Air, the Bel Air Homeowners Alliance, chaired by Fred Rosen, was formed to oppose it.[21] In January 2015, Nancy Walton Laurie, an heiress to the Walmart fortune and a Bel Air resident, filed a lawsuit through her company, LW Partnership, against Hadid.[23] Laurie accused Hadid of damaging the roots of a eucalyptus tree on her property with a retaining wall he built next to her house.[23]\n\nIn December 2015, the Los Angeles city council voted to pursue criminal charges over a claim that Hadid violated local zoning laws. The council alleged he built his house contrary to multiple planning orders and made it twice the permitted size.[24][25] In May 2017, Hadid pleaded no contest to misdemeanor charges stemming from mansion-construction issues for which he did not receive city approval, and was sentenced that July to community service and fines.[26][27]\n\nIn July 2017, he was sentenced to 200 hours of community service, summoned to return $14,191 to the City of Los Angeles in damages, and fined $3,000.[28] He was also given a three-year probation period to ensure the property would comply with existing regulations, or he would face a 180-day jail sentence.[28]\n\nAthletic career\n\nHadid competed in the demonstration sport of speed skiing at the 1992 Winter Olympics, representing Jordan. He was 43 years old at the time. Hadid was encouraged to participate by his friend, Austrian Olympic skier Franz Weber. Hadid was the only member of the Jordanian delegation,[1] and remains the only person to have represented Jordan in the Winter Olympics.[29][30]\n\nTelevision appearances\n\nHadid has appeared on the TV show The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, as the ex-husband of Yolanda Hadid.[22] He has also appeared on Shahs of Sunset,[21] and Second Wives Club on E! with his fianc\xc3\xa9e Shiva Safai in 2017.[31]\n\nPersonal life\n\nHadid\'s first marriage was with Mary Butler, with whom he had two daughters, Alana Hadid and Marielle Hadid. He and Butler ended their marriage in 1992.[32][33]\n\nFrom 1994 until their divorce in 2000, he was married to the Dutch model Yolanda Hadid, n\xc3\xa9e Van den Herik.[34] They had three children, who all became models: Gigi (born 1995), Bella (born 1996),[33] and Anwar (born 1999).[35]\n\nIn 2014, Hadid was engaged to Shiva Safai, a model and businesswoman. She was born in Iran and raised in Norway, and at age 19, moved to Los Angeles with her family.[36] Safai, who is 33 years his junior, began to appear in E! reality show, Second Wives Club in 2017.[37][38] As of December 2019, Hadid and Safai had split, and she was now in a relationship with Niels Houweling.[39]\n\nHadid is a dual Jordanian-American citizen.[1] He does not consider himself a devout Muslim,[14] but has never drunk alcohol, although he does have a 5,000-bottle wine cellar, including some from his own Beverly Hills winery.[18]\n\nReferences\n\nOfficial website'"
"b'Tonight we have to go through some more bunny business. So let\xe2\x80\x99s get straight to that. Annnnnnd of course we have to replay the whole stupid scene again. Andy and Kyle seem to think this is hilarious. Andy just wants to be sure he gets the bunny for the clubhouse. If Kim was so afraid of the bad bunny energy in her house, why did she keep possession (pun intended) of the damn thing for weeks on end?\n\nRinna has one of the best props ever it\xe2\x80\x99s a little blue box that you press like a remote and it says Fuck You! I need this in my life. Rinna says that Kim just wants to be on the show and she is her meal ticket. I have to say that when Kim was IN MY OPINION near death, I set a Google alert on her. It\xe2\x80\x99s the only Google Alert I have. I used to cringe when they would come through because it was always something bad. For the last year or so, I only get one when she in on RHOBH and Rinna\xe2\x80\x99s name is always on it too. Rinna has a lot of other publicity. Kim only has Rinna.\n\nDorit the idiot opens her mouth and I scream at her to shut up louder than Rinna did. Just shut the fuck up Dorit, this has nothing to do with you. Just shut the fuck up.\n\nAndy is going to need to change pants several times he is so orgasmic about all the verbal jabs flying back and forth. Then he joins in with an imaginary question harking back to Kyle saying in the limo at the end of season one that Maurice takes care of Kim like a second wife and she still treats them badly. The question was, \xe2\x80\x9cHow is that not enabling?\xe2\x80\x9d Kyle is very thrown by the question. Kyle doesn\xe2\x80\x99t really know what an enabler is. She thinks it is just about giving the addict alcohol.\n\nEileen sticks up for Rinna. Kim is overtalking everyone. All of these scenes where Kim is trotted out do not make her look sober. In my opinion.\n\nI think this is Round Four Xanax v. Coke. How the hell do I pick a side here? Can I have some of both? Dorit literally makes no sense when she tried to tell her side. Rinna says the Xanax story was in the press and she has kids. And then Kim says it\xe2\x80\x99s in the press about me too and it hurts my kids. Yes Kim, multiple arrests, fleeing multiple rehabs under cover of darkness, disrupting your kids wedding and appearing to be unhinged in public all while not completing your court appointed sentence is exactly the same as Rinna joking about having a Xanax smoothie. It\xe2\x80\x99s totally the same.\n\nAndy tries to wrap things up and hopefully get Kim off the stage, but Eileen interrupts and wants to know why Kim thinking being on a soap opera is an insult. Kim says that soap operas are more dramatic. Eileen asks Kim, \xe2\x80\x9cHave you seen yourself on TV?\xe2\x80\x9d Kim is the most overly dramatic person on any franchise and Eileen is frequently called boring because she is not dramatic at all in real life.\n\nIs Eileen only wearing one super long earring on purpose or did she lose one?\n\nLVP hasn\xe2\x80\x99t said twenty words this entire reunion. Why should she when Dorit will say it all? She really had no storyline other than animals and kids. The found Max\xe2\x80\x99s mother through a PI. Max says he wants to meet his birth mother to than her for giving him up. LVP is fine with it. It sort of sounds like LVP wants to have him communicate through an intermediary. A viewer tried to give LVP shit for giving Max his own place. If you listen closely to the recording you hear her say he still has to pay the mortgage on the place. I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a problem with her doing that at all, if she can afford it. It\xe2\x80\x99s also a good way to hide assets by selling the property at a loss to your child for tax purposes. Or putting it in a family trust. She also got grief for not consoling Ken when he was crying about dogs. LVP and Eileen seem good. Maybe not really good. But good.\n\nAndy ribs Rinna (SWIDT?) about posting a nude on Instagram. She says she loves the attention but the girls made her take it down. Harry didn\xe2\x80\x99t know about it. We go right into another segment about Rinna. Because RINNA IS THE DAMN SHOW. Andy seems impressed that both her girls are high fashion models. Erika recently had dinner with Yolanda.\n\nEveryone loves Harry. And his meat. And his pies. Harry watches all the shows and often tells Rinna, \xe2\x80\x9cYou just can\xe2\x80\x99t help yourself, can you?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIt seems that with the exception of Rinna and Kim, and perhaps Rinna and Eden and also Rinna and Dorit \xe2\x80\xa6 everyone gets along well enough.\n\nAndy takes the bunny for the clubhouse whether they want him to or not.\n\nShare this:\n\nTweet\n\n'"

McClean\'s contemporary homes have also sold to the Winklevoss twins, Calvin Klein, and Swedish DJ Avicii.\n\nLos Angeles real estate developer Nile Niami bought the hilltop property in 2012 for $28 million and gutted the original 10,000 square-foot house to make room for the mega-mansion, which he dubbed ""The One,"" according to the New York Times.\n\nAt 100,000 square-feet, the house will also be one of the largest private residences in the US \xe2\x80\x94 but the amenities sound more like a hotel than a home.\n\nWithin floor-to-ceiling glass walls, there\'s a casino, a jellyfish tank, a beauty salon, a nightclub with VIP seating, plus two indoor swimming pools and two spa pools, and an infinity edge moat surrounding the property.\n\nNiami told the Times he included the Gatsby-like amenities ""because it\'s cool.""\n\n""Let\'s say you\'re a super-wealthy single dude who just sold your company. You\'ve just moved to LA and you don\'t know anybody, so you hire someone to fill your house with partiers,"" Niami told the Times. ""You want everyone to know who you are, but you don\'t want to talk to anybody.

The home has 20 bedrooms, seven of which are in a separate building for staff. The master suite measures 5,500 square feet and includes a separate pool, kitchen, and office.\n\nAlthough McClean is no stranger to designing mansions \xe2\x80\x94 over half of his homes are larger than 8,000 square feet \xe2\x80\x94 ""The One"" was a challenge, he told the Orange County Register.\n\n""There are very few homes this size,"" McClean said. ""We had to think of it in a different manner than other homes. We looked at hotels. We even looked at palaces because that\'s what this is, a modern-day palace.""\n\nThe most expensive home ever sold to date in the US went for $137 million, while the most expensive home in the world, a chateau in France, sold for $300 million.\n\nMany real estate experts cited by the Times are skeptical Niami will find a buyer willing to shell out anywhere near $500 million for ""The One.""\n\nBut even if the mega-mansion sells for half the listing price, Niami would likely still walk away with a huge profit \xe2\x80\x94 and perhaps lifelong bragging rights.'"

"b'Grant Gustin/The CW\n\nTV Reviews All of our TV reviews in one convenient place. Prev Next View All\n\nThe Flash Season 3 B ""The Once And Future Flash"" Episode 19\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs if to prove that Barry Allen isn\xe2\x80\x99t the worst after all, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Once And Future Flash\xe2\x80\x9d takes us to the year 2024, where we meet\xe2\x80\xa6the worst Barry Allen ever. For about the first two-thirds of its running time, tonight\xe2\x80\x99s episode is another dour power hour, a Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come trip to a dismal future where the members of Team Flash are all either dead or broken. Somehow The Flash is able to pull out of this tailspin and rally, delivering a rousing and emotionally satisfying final act that rescues the episode from the depths of bleakness.\n\nBefore that happens, however, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Once And Future Flash\xe2\x80\x9d plays almost like a parody of the big-screen version of the DC Universe, that Zack Snyder world of oppressive, self-conscious gloom and humorless, damaged-goods heroes. Killer Frost escapes from STAR Labs, which Barry takes as a sign that this is the perfect time to travel to the future and collect intel on Savitar. (This is one time when Barry isn\xe2\x80\x99t actually being a bonehead: anytime is the perfect time, since he can always travel back to the exact moment he left. This is a concept people will have trouble with throughout the episode.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe 2024 he arrives in is, in Community parlance, the darkest timeline. The Flash has been missing for years, leaving villains like Mirror Master and the Top to run roughshod over Central City. Cisco is a shadow of his former self, deprived of his powers when Killer Frost froze off his hands (an effectively shocking moment). Wally is in a wheelchair, his spine snapped after facing Savitar alone. (So much for those super-healing powers, I guess.) Julian now works in a prison where he can look after the captured Killer Frost. Joe hangs around Iris\xe2\x80\x99s grave, having been abandoned by Barry. That would be Future Emo Barry, with his stringy hair and black wardrobe, holed up in the abandoned and trashed STAR Labs, living in the past.\n\nThis is all very depressing, but worse than that, it\xe2\x80\x99s (almost) meaningless. This future ceases to exists as soon as Barry gets back to his own time and starts changing things. Spending so much time here all but guarantees that Iris won\xe2\x80\x99t be killed at season\xe2\x80\x99s end, because we\xe2\x80\x99ve already seen the effects of that happening. Why waste the emotional impact of Joe standing over Iris\xe2\x80\x99s grave now? Only because it\xe2\x80\x99s not going to happen later.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI said it\xe2\x80\x99s almost meaningless, because the effect it all has on 2017 Barry does make an impact. Sure, Barry has a bad habit of not learning from his mistakes and repeating them over and over, but seeing the way Future Emo Barry has abandoned Joe strengthens his resolve to never let that happen. This is Scrooge seeing the error of his ways and vowing to change, which makes me wonder why this wasn\xe2\x80\x99t scheduled as the Christmas episode.\n\nTo that end, 2017 Barry decides to stay long enough to repair the fractured Team Flash and take down Mirror Master and Top. This is where the episode really comes to life, and a lot of the credit is due to director Tom Cavanagh. He\xe2\x80\x99s already worn so many different hats on this show that stepping behind the camera was probably inevitable, and while he does a decent job with the bleak portion of the episode, it\xe2\x80\x99s probably no coincidence that the hour improves drastically as soon as we see what future HR is up to. (He\xe2\x80\x99s reading his romance novel to a crowd of appreciative women who are all eager to get in his pants. At least the future worked out for someone!)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nArranging the reunion of the surviving and able-bodied members of Team Flash is something Barry doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have to do. Again, from his point-of-view this is only one possible future; if he is successful in changing events, it will never come to exist. It still feels like the right thing to do, though, and the way it plays out, it\xe2\x80\x99s almost as if we\xe2\x80\x99re getting a glimpse of a Flash reunion special years from now. The battle with Mirror Master and Top gives us some freaky Inception-type visuals of bendy buildings as well as a look at the future Flash outfit when Emo Barry finally snaps out of and joins the fight. One thing it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t give us, that now feels way overdue, is Savitar\xe2\x80\x99s identity. In the end we\xe2\x80\x99re left with yet another tease as Savitar meets up with Killer Frost and removes his outer shell to win her trust. Who does she see? That will have to wait yet again. Ugh.\n\nStray observations\n\nMirror Master was always my favorite Rogue from the comics, but this version is a dud, I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid: personality-free and falling far short of exploiting all the possibilities of mirror powers. Bring on the Earth-2 or Earth-16 or Earth-39 version.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSecrets always were our thing, weren\xe2\x80\x99t they?\xe2\x80\x9d Killer Frost, you have crystallized one of The Flash\xe2\x80\x99s biggest flaws with surgical precision.\n\n\n\nHR\xe2\x80\x99s novel is called The Streak vs. Mr. Reflecto. Where does he get his ideas?\n\nSo if Savitar is trapped in the Speed Force in 2024, that rules out Wally, Julian, Cisco, Barry, Joe, and Caitlin as his secret identity, right? We see all of them in the future. Unless, of course, it\xe2\x80\x99s one of them from even further in the future. Just tell us already.\n\nBarry vowed to never tamper with the past again. But when Future Emo Barry gives Barry the Speed Force trap tech to bring back to 2017 with him\xe2\x80\xa6isn\xe2\x80\x99t he tampering with the past? (Yes. Yes, he definitely is.)'"

While Iris expresses excitement, Barry is concerned that she could alter the timeline based on his own mistakes with time travel. When Barry tries to send Nora home, Wally reveals that Nora\'s blood is saturated with negative tachyons, preventing her from using the Speed Force or the Legends\' Waverider to time travel. Barry asks Nora what happens to him in the future, so she reveals that he never returned after disappearing in 2024 and that she traveled back in time to meet him. A new metahuman named Gridlock, who is able to harness kinetic energy, causes a plane to fall, so Barry, Nora, Wally, and Cisco team up to save it, with Nora providing Barry a Flash ring suit. They phase the plane through the buildings so it lands safely in the river. While Gridlock is being transported to prison, the convoy is attacked by a masked individual, who tells Gridlock that he plans to wipe out all metahumans before approaching him with a lightning-shaped dagger.\n\n94 2 ""Blocked"" Kim Miles Eric Wallace & Judalina Neira October 16, 2018 ( ) T27.13752 1.69[4]\n\nBarry struggles to train the overeager Nora, who gets herself hired as a CSI intern to spend more time with her father, much to Iris\' discomfort. Caitlin and Ralph try to help Cisco following his breakup with Gypsy, with Cisco eventually accepting he needs to move on. Caitlin refuses to pursue the idea that her father might still be alive, despite Ralph\'s insistence. Cecile starts to lose her telepathy and struggles to connect with her child without being able to know her thoughts. Meanwhile, a new meta called ""Block,"" who can create blocks of dense air, steals weapons from her old gang and, while trying to stop her, the team has their first encounter with Cicada, the masked man who killed Gridlock. He stabs Block, but Nora manages to speed her away from the scene. Cicada then uses his dagger, which he has telekinetic control of, to neutralize the team\'s powers, beat them severely, slash Cisco\'s hands, and nearly kill Barry before Nora drives him off. Cisco vibes Caitlin, learning that her mother is involved with her father\'s disappearance. Iris reveals that she has been investigating the masked individual and the team discovers that Nora already knows about him.\n\n95 3 ""The Death of Vibe"" Andi Armaganian Jonathan Butler & Gabriel Garza October 23, 2018 ( ) T27.13753 1.87[5]\n\nThe team recruits Harrison Sherloque Wells to help them catch Cicada, who Nora reveals is unstoppable in the future. Caitlin and Ralph confront Caitlin\'s mother, Carla Tannhauser, who denies forging her husband\'s death certificate. They later break into her files and find a suicide note from Caitlin\'s father. Sherloque pinpoints Cicada as David Hersch, as he was previously correct 37 times. As a result of Nora\'s tampering with the timeline, however, his identity on Earth-1 is different. Cicada attacks Joe to lure out Vibe and, when Cisco arrives, Cicada stabs him and breaks his arm. Barry arrives, but is easily defeated. Nora enacts an explosion to drive Cicada off, which results in Cisco\'s apparent death. However, Cisco reappears, having used a breach machine to escape. With the public and Cicada believing that Vibe is dead, Sherloque agrees to help the team. Caitlin deciphers a hidden message from her father, Thomas, asking her to come find him. Cicada visits his comatose niece in the hospital. Nora agrees to stay with her parents, despite her seemingly strained relationship with Iris. Sherloque begins to suspect that Nora is not in 2018 for the reasons she gave.\n\n96 4 ""News Flash"" Brent Crowell Kelly Wheeler & Lauren Certo October 30, 2018 ( ) T27.13754 1.75[6]\n\nThe team discovers articles about XS written by one of Iris\' former colleagues, Spencer Young, which are all published just before the events take place. Iris contacts Spencer to ask her to refrain from putting XS in her articles in order to protect Nora, but fails. Spencer is revealed to be in possession of a phone that allows her to control people\'s minds so she can create articles for her blog. Iris learns from Nora that she does not like her because, in the future, the former implanted her with a meta-dampening chip that disabled her powers. Barry and Nora go to the stadium when a bomb threat is reported; there, Spencer uses her tech to hypnotize XS into trying to kill the Flash. Iris eventually stops XS by shooting her with a tranquilizer dart, allowing Nora to regain her mind and Barry to arrest Spencer. The team discovers that Spencer\'s phone and Cicada\'s dagger have meta abilities, created from DeVoe\'s satellite explosion, meaning meta-tech could be in the hands of anyone. It is later revealed that Cicada has acquired super-strength.\n\n97 5 ""All Doll\'d Up"" Philip Chipera Thomas Pound & Sterling Gates November 13, 2018 ( ) T27.13755 1.73[7]\n\nBarry and Nora go to stop some art thieves, with Iris getting frustrated when Nora cuts her off. Nora reveals that, in the future, Iris is cold, distant, and critical of her actions. Nora goes to spend some time with Cecile, finding out more about Iris from her. Later, a new meta called Rag Doll attacks an architect and destroys his office, though the Flash saves him. Iris and Barry try to investigate the new meta, but the latter gets captured by Rag Doll and held hostage on a rooftop with power-dampening cuffs (though the villain is unaware of Barry\'s abilities). Ralph and Iris go to save Barry, Iris jumping off the building to remove Barry\'s cuffs while he is falling and allowing him to save them just as Ralph defeats Rag Doll. Iris later reconciles with Nora and the two start to grow closer. Meanwhile, Cisco, Caitlin, Ralph, and Sherloque investigate Caitlin\'s father and track him to a university office and chem lab before Cisco suddenly collapses. As his damaged hands negatively affect his health while using his powers, Cisco takes control of DeVoe\'s satellites so he can try and find both Thomas and Cicada.\n\n98 6 ""The Icicle Cometh"" Chris Peppe Kristen Kim & Joshua V. Gilbert November 20, 2018 ( ) T27.13756 1.60[8]\n\nBarry, Cisco, and Caitlin find her father, Thomas, in an arctic facility and bring him to S.T.A.R. Labs, where he reveals that both he and Caitlin developed ice powers as a result of his experiments in trying to treat their ALS gene. Thomas claims he is dying as a result of never having manifested an alternate personality like Killer Frost, but Cisco is suspicious. He returns to Thomas\' lab, where he discovers ""Thomas"" is actually an alternate personality wearing skin grafts to pose as him. Caitlin realizes that a serum she created to cure her father would actually kill his human side. Cornered, Thomas\' alter ego, ""Icicle"", emerges and attempts to kill Team Flash with absolute zero temperatures, but Caitlin proves to be immune. With the rest of the team incapacitated, Killer Frost returns and defeats Icicle, forcing him to flee. Team Flash determines that Dominic Lanse / Brainstorm\'s powers caused Killer Frost\'s disappearance and they also learn the name of Cicada\'s niece, Grace.\n\n99 7 ""O Come, All Ye Thankful"" Sarah Boyd Jonathan Butler & Gabriel Garza November 27, 2018 ( ) T27.13757 1.79[9]\n\nBarry attempts to see Grace, but Cicada\'s reluctant ally Dr. Ambres impedes him. Barry and Nora later stop a freak lightning storm from hitting Central City\'s power grid. Team Flash suspects Mark Mardon, even though he\'s in jail, but Nora and Barry instead encounter his estranged daughter, Joss Jackam / Weather Witch, who wields a weather control staff like her father. Barry and Nora bring Mardon to her in order to appease her, but to no avail. An angered Joss attacks an airport with a lightning tornado, so Barry uses Mardon\'s wand to absorb Joss\' lightning and subdue her. Team Flash finally discovers Cicada\'s identity: Orlin Dwyer. In flashbacks, Orlin is shown adopting Grace after her mother\'s death in a metahuman attack and, while bonding, debris from DeVoe\'s satellite put Grace in a coma and impaled Orlin with shrapnel that would later become his dagger. Blaming metahumans for what happened, Orlin vowed to exterminate them all on Grace\'s behalf.\n\nBarry and Nora time travel to gather items needed to stop Cicada; a highly magnetic alloy from Savitar\'s armor, Harry Wells\' Speed Force transmitter, and dark matter. They first travel to Team Flash\'s final battle with Savitar. After a Time Wraith appears, Barry distracts it so Nora can retrieve a piece of the armor. They next travel to when Zoom stole Barry\'s speed for the transmitter, which Barry obtains from Harry. Zoom discovers Barry and Nora and gives chase before he is stopped by the Time Wraith, though this breaks the transmitter in the process. Even though he is reluctant, Nora convinces Barry to ask Eobard Thawne for help. Despite some initial difficulty, Barry convinces Thawne to fix the transmitter by claiming he will never get home if he does not. Finally, Barry and Nora travel to the night of the particle accelerator explosion. In the Time Vault, Gideon reroutes part of the dark matter through the shard and transmitter, and Barry reveals to Nora that Thawne killed his mother. Back in the present, Team Flash separates Cicada from his dagger temporarily before he escapes. Nora returns to 2049 to confront Thawne at Iron Heights.\n\nOn a decimated Earth-90, the Flash is seen crawling towards a book, but a mysterious stranger picks it up and uses it to destroy that reality, though the Flash escapes. On Earth-1, the stranger presents the book to Arkham Asylum psychiatrist Dr. John Deegan and instructs him to rewrite reality as he sees fit. The following morning, under threatening red skies, Oliver Queen and Barry discover that they have swapped lives, with everyone believing they are each other. When they seek the assistance of Team Flash, they are not believed and locked in the pipeline. Barry and Oliver use each other\'s abilities to escape and convince a reluctant Iris to allow them to flee to Earth-38 to enlist the help of Kara Danvers / Supergirl and her cousin, Clark Kent / Superman. Back on Earth-1, the heroes join forces to stop A.M.A.Z.O., an android that can copy their abilities. They stop the android and, after seeing a vision of the stranger from Cisco, realize they must travel to Gotham City. This episode begins a crossover event that continues on Arrow season 7 episode 9 and concludes on Supergirl season 4 episode 9.\n\n102 10 ""The Flash & the Furious"" David McWhirter Kelly Wheeler & Sterling Gates January 15, 2019 ( ) T27.13760 1.64[12]\n\nNora refuses to continue working with Thawne upon learning he killed her grandmother. Barry and Nora encounter a new villain, Silver Ghost, who possesses meta tech allowing her to access any car. An encounter with her and her tech leaves Barry phasing uncontrollably, so Nora and Team Flash help him into the pipeline, where he can stabilize for 24 hours. Silver Ghost frees Joss Jackam from CCPD\'s custody so she can help her steal a WayneTech car in A.R.G.U.S.\'s possession. Silver Ghost uses the car\'s tech to evade capture until Cisco patches Nora\'s voice into the radio, urging Joss to turn herself in and offering a second chance. Joss secretly disables the car before escaping with Silver Ghost. Caitlin helps heal Cisco\'s hands and they agree to try to develop a meta cure with the caveat that it is never forced on anyone. Nora returns to the future and reluctantly agrees to help Thawne, who has less than an hour left to live. Sherloque gains access to the Time Vault, but discovers the files on Nora West-Allen have been deleted by her.\n\n103 11 ""Seeing Red"" Marcus Stokes Judalina Neira & Thomas Pound January 22, 2019 ( ) T27.13761 1.88[13]\n\nCicada returns, killing metahumans from an arrest log provided by someone inside CCPD. When Team Flash tries to stop him, the villain paralyzes Nora and slows down her speed healing. Once the team determines Cicada\'s pattern, Cecile tracks down the informant while the rest round up the remaining metas on the log. Caitlin continues working on the metahuman cure, but needs blood from a recently created one. Cicada finds the meta group protected by Team Flash. While Ralph helps the metas escape, Flash and Killer Frost distract Cicada, the latter drawing blood from him for the cure. Incensed from what happened to Nora, Flash nearly kills Cicada before she rushes over to stop him, inadvertently allowing the killer to escape. Sherloque ignores Iris\' order to stop investigating Nora and discovers two handwriting styles in her journal. While having dinner with Iris and Nora, Barry comes up with the idea to appeal to Cicada\'s heart by trying to wake up Grace.\n\n104 12 ""Memorabilia"" Rebecca Johnson Sam Chalsen & Kristen Kim January 29, 2019 ( ) T27.13762 2.04[14]\n\nThe team plans to wake up Grace using Sherloque\'s Memory Machine from Earth-221. Against his instructions, Nora enters Grace\'s memories by herself to prevent the others from learning about her secret alliance with Thawne. To her horror, she discovers that Grace is consciously aware of Orlin\'s actions and wholeheartedly supports him in his anti-metahuman agenda before being attacked by a female version of Cicada. Meanwhile, Barry and Iris discover what Nora did and go in after her, only to end up in her memories of the Flash Museum and attacked by the Reverse-Flash exhibit. Despite heavy resistance, Barry and Iris manage to escape Nora\'s memories and save her from Cicada, but they are unable to bring Grace, as she refuses to wake up and believes Nora is a liar. Upon further review of their adventure, Caitlin learns that a satellite shard became lodged in Grace\'s brain and created a barrier around it, meaning they cannot try again. Iris establishes the Central City Citizen, which Nora reveals was originally founded in 2021, meaning Iris is changing the future. Cisco makes some headway on the meta cure, which Barry decides to use on Cicada.\n\n105 13 ""Goldfaced"" Alexandra LaRoche Jonathan Butler & Gabriel Garza February 5, 2019 ( ) T27.13763 1.89[15]\n\nTeam Flash completes the metahuman cure, but requires Cicada to hold still long enough for it to take effect. Ralph finds a device capable of doing so in the hands of a metahuman crime boss called Goldface. Despite Barry\'s hesitation, he and Ralph go undercover as criminals to retrieve it from him. Though he is suspicious, Goldface decides to take the heroes on a job to steal a 3-D printer from Ivo Labs in exchange for the device. Even though they are discovered, Barry and Ralph are able to stop Goldface and his men. Elsewhere, Iris starts investigating Cicada for the Central City Citizen and discovers where he lives. She is able to get inside, but he sees through her and tries to kill her. After a protracted fight, she discovers his weakness but, when Team Flash investigates, they find Cicada gone. Under orders from Thawne, Nora tries to steer Sherloque away from her by helping him fall in love with a woman named Renee Adler. Despite a bad first meeting, Sherloque and Renee eventually fall for each other. After discovering she is a meta, Sherloque devotes all of his attention to protecting her from Cicada.\n\n106 14 ""Cause and XS"" Rachel Talalay Todd Helbing & Jeff Hersh February 12, 2019 ( ) T27.13764 1.71[16]\n\nBarry takes the meta cure into the Speed Force for an hour to help speed up the synthesizing process, leaving an uneasy Nora behind. Elsewhere, Cicada kidnaps Iris, but she manages to alert Nora and Killer Frost to her location. They arrive, but Cicada slays Killer Frost, distressing Nora to the point where she runs so fast that she resets the timeline. When Nora tries to prevent Iris\' death, Cicada ends up kidnapping Sherloque instead and, although the situation plays out like last time, Cisco dies this time. Nora repeatedly resets the timeline but, on each new attempt, at least one person on Team Flash always gets killed. Eventually, Cisco reveals the loops to the team, forcing Nora to confess what has happened. Cisco consoles her and, together with the rest of the team, works on a new plan to stop Cicada. This time, they make it so that Cicada accidentally stabs himself with his dagger, forcing him to flee. Once Barry returns and learns what Nora has done, he warns her against altering time any further. Elsewhere, Sherloque manages to decode Nora\'s entire journal using symbols she unwittingly revealed during the meeting with the team.\n\n107 15 ""King Shark vs. Gorilla Grodd"" Stefan Pleszczynski Eric Wallace & Lauren Certo March 5, 2019 ( ) T27.13765 1.67[17]\n\nWith the metahuman cure finally finished, Team Flash decides that King Shark would be the ideal test subject. The team travels to A.R.G.U.S. and asks Lyla to get in contact with King Shark, who aggressively attacks the team while under Gorilla Grodd\'s mind control. Barry reacts by injecting the cure into King Shark, turning him back into his human form \xe2\x80\x93 Shay Lamden. Back at S.T.A.R. Labs, Caitlin discovers that, although the cure worked, there is still dark matter in Shay\'s pituitary gland, causing his body to rapidly change back and forth between his two forms. Shay\'s wife Tanya is convinced by Sherloque to talk with Shay. Later that night, Grodd controls Cisco and Caitlin so he can steal Dr. Lamden\'s telepathy crown and amplify his powers, enabling him to control all of Central City. Seeing no other option and wanting to make amends for his crimes as King Shark, Shay volunteers to change back to help Team Flash stop Grodd, in spite of the possibility that he may never be human again. Meanwhile, Joe returns home to Cecile and trains Iris to overcome Cicada, to whom Barry suggests they offer the cure instead of forcing it on him.\n\n108 16 ""Failure Is an Orphan"" Viet Nguyen Zack Stentz March 12, 2019 ( ) T27.13766 1.55[18]\n\nIn 2049, Thawne warns Nora that they have to act fast to stop Cicada once and for all, because a new timeline is trying to push its way into being, bringing something really big with it. In the present, Nora and Barry confront a new metahuman, Acid Master, whose burn mark was on a newspaper article shown to Nora in the future, leading her to deduce that the final confrontation with Cicada is upon them.

"b'Not to be confused with The Handmaiden\n\n1985 novel by Margaret Atwood\n\nThe Handmaid\'s Tale is a dystopian novel[6] by Canadian author Margaret Atwood, published in 1985. It is set in a near-future New England, in a strongly patriarchal, quasi-Christian, totalitarian state, known as Gilead, that has overthrown the United States government. The central character and narrator is a woman named Offred, one of the group known as ""handmaids"", who are forcibly assigned to produce children for the ""commanders"" \xe2\x80\x93 the ruling class of men.\n\nThe novel explores themes of subjugated women in a patriarchal society and the various means by which they resist and attempt to gain individuality and independence. The novel\'s title echoes the component parts of Geoffrey Chaucer\'s The Canterbury Tales, which is a series of connected stories (""The Merchant\'s Tale"", ""The Parson\'s Tale"", etc.).[7]\n\nThe Handmaid\'s Tale won the 1985 Governor General\'s Award and the first Arthur C. Clarke Award in 1987; it was also nominated for the 1986 Nebula Award, the 1986 Booker Prize, and the 1987 Prometheus Award. The book has been adapted into a 1990 film, a 2000 opera, a 2017 television series, and other media.\n\nIn 2019, a sequel novel, The Testaments, was published.\n\nPlot summary [ edit ]\n\nAfter a staged attack that killed the President of the United States and most of Congress, a radical political group called the ""Sons of Jacob"" used quasi-Christian ideology to launch a revolution. The United States Constitution was suspended, newspapers were censored, and what was formerly the United States of America was changed into a military dictatorship known as the Republic of Gilead. The new regime moved quickly to consolidate its power, overtaking all other religious groups, including traditional Christian denominations. In addition, the regime reorganized society using a peculiar interpretation of some Old Testament ideas, and a new militarized, hierarchical model of social and religious fanaticism among its newly created social classes. Above all, the biggest change is the severe limitation of people\'s rights, especially those of women, who are not allowed to read, write, own property, or handle money. Most significantly, women are deprived of control over their own reproductive functions.\n\nThe story is told in first-person narration by a woman named Offred. In this era of environmental pollution and radiation, she is one of few fertile women remaining. Therefore, she is forcibly assigned to produce children for the ""Commanders"", the ruling class of men, and is known as a ""Handmaid"" based on the biblical story of Rachel and her handmaid Bilhah. Apart from Handmaids, other women are also classed socially and follow a strict dress code, ranked highest to lowest: the Commanders\' Wives in blue; the Handmaids in red with white veils around their faces; the Aunts (who train and indoctrinate the Handmaids) in brown; the Marthas (cooks and maids) in green; Econowives (the wives of lower-ranking men who handle everything in the domestic sphere) in blue, red and green stripes; young, unmarried girls in white; and widows in black.\n\nOffred details her life starting with her third assignment as a Handmaid to a Commander. Interspersed with her narratives of her present-day experiences are flashbacks of her life before and during the beginning of the revolution, including her failed attempt to escape to Canada with her husband and child, her indoctrination into life as a Handmaid by the Aunts, and the escape of her friend Moira from the indoctrination facility. At her new home, she is treated poorly by the Commander\'s wife, a former Christian media personality named Serena Joy who supported women\'s domesticity and subordinate role well before Gilead was established. To Offred\'s surprise, the Commander requests to see her outside of the ""Ceremony"", a reproductive ritual obligatory for handmaids and intended to result in conception in the presence of his wife. The two begin an illegal relationship where they play Scrabble and Offred is allowed to ask favours of him, whether in terms of information or material items. Finally, he gives her lingerie and takes her to a covert, government-run brothel called Jezebel\'s. Offred unexpectedly encounters Moira there, with her will broken, and she learns that those who are found breaking the law are sent to the Colonies to clean up toxic waste or are allowed to work at Jezebel\'s as punishment.\n\nIn the days between her visits to the Commander, Offred also learns from her shopping partner, a woman called Ofglen, of the Mayday resistance, an underground network working to overthrow the Republic of Gilead. Not knowing of Offred\'s criminal acts with her husband, Serena begins to suspect that the Commander is infertile, and arranges for Offred to begin a covert sexual relationship with Nick, the Commander\'s personal servant. After their initial sexual encounter, Offred and Nick begin to meet on their own initiative as well, with Offred discovering that she enjoys these intimate moments despite memories of her husband, and shares potentially dangerous information about her past with him. However, shortly after, Ofglen disappears (reported as a suicide), and Serena finds evidence of the relationship between Offred and the Commander, which causes Offred to contemplate suicide.\n\nOffred tells Nick that she thinks she is pregnant. Shortly afterward, men arrive at the house wearing the uniform of the secret police, the Eyes of God, known informally as ""the Eyes"", to take her away. As she is led to a waiting van, Nick tells her to trust him and go with the men. It is unclear whether the men are actually Eyes or members of the Mayday resistance. Offred is still unsure if Nick is a member of Mayday or an Eye posing as one, and does not know if leaving will result in her escape or her capture. Ultimately, she enters the van with her future uncertain.\n\nThe novel concludes with a metafictional epilogue, described as a partial transcript of an international historical association conference taking place in the year 2195. The keynote speaker explains that Offred\'s account of the events of the novel was recorded onto cassette tapes later found and transcribed by historians studying what is then called ""the Gilead Period."" Professor Pieixoto makes a sexist joke about Professor Maryann Crescent Moon, causing laughter from the audience\xe2\x80\x94highlighting lingering issues regarding attitudes towards women, and his ignorance toward the situation.[citation needed]\n\nBackground [ edit ]\n\nFitting with her statements that The Handmaid\'s Tale is a work of speculative fiction, not science fiction, Atwood\'s novel offers a satirical view of various social, political, and religious trends of the United States in the 1980s. Her motivation for writing the novel was her belief that in the 1980s, the religious right was discussing what they would do with/to women if they took power, including the Moral Majority, Focus on the Family, the Christian Coalition and the Ronald Reagan administration.[8] Further, Atwood questions what would happen if these trends, and especially ""casually held attitudes about women"" were taken to their logical end.[9] Atwood continues to argue that all of the scenarios offered in The Handmaid\'s Tale have actually occurred in real life\xe2\x80\x94in an interview she gave regarding Oryx and Crake, Atwood maintains that ""As with The Handmaid\'s Tale, I didn\'t put in anything that we haven\'t already done, we\'re not already doing, we\'re seriously trying to do, coupled with trends that are already in progress... So all of those things are real, and therefore the amount of pure invention is close to nil.""[10] Atwood was also known to carry around newspaper clippings to her various interviews to support her fiction\'s basis in reality.[11] Atwood has explained that The Handmaid\'s Tale is a response to those who say the oppressive, totalitarian, and religious governments that have taken hold in other countries throughout the years ""can\'t happen here""\xe2\x80\x94but in this work, she has tried to show how such a takeover might play out.[12]\n\nAtwood\'s inspiration for the Republic of Gilead came from her study of early American Puritans while at Harvard, which she attended on a Woodrow Wilson Fellowship.[9] Atwood argues that the modern view of the Puritans\xe2\x80\x94that they came to America to flee religious persecution in England and set up a religiously tolerant society\xe2\x80\x94is misleading, and that instead, these Puritan leaders wanted to establish a monolithic theocracy where religious dissent would not be tolerated.[9] Atwood also had a personal connection to the Puritans, and she dedicates the novel to her own ancestor Mary Webster, who was accused of witchcraft in Puritan New England but survived her hanging.[13] Due to the totalitarian nature of Gileadan society, Atwood, in creating the setting, drew from the ""utopian idealism"" present in 20th century r\xc3\xa9gimes, such as Cambodia and Romania, as well as earlier New England Puritanism.[14] Atwood has argued that a coup, such as the one depicted in The Handmaid\'s Tale, would misuse religion in order to achieve its own ends.[15][14]\n\nAtwood, with respect to those leading Gilead, further stated:[16]\n\nI don\'t consider these people to be Christians because they do not have at the core of their behavior and ideologies what I, in my feeble Canadian way, would consider to be the core of Christianity \xe2\x80\xa6 and that would be not only love your neighbors but love your enemies. That would also be \'I was sick and you visited me not\' and such and such \xe2\x80\xa6And that would include also concern for the environment, because you can\'t love your neighbor or even your enemy, unless you love your neighbor\'s oxygen, food, and water. You can\'t love your neighbor or your enemy if you\'re presuming policies that are going to cause those people to die. \xe2\x80\xa6 Of course faith can be a force for good and often has been. So faith is a force for good particularly when people are feeling beleaguered and in need of hope. So you can have bad iterations and you can also have the iteration in which people have got too much power and then start abusing it. But that is human behavior, so you can\'t lay it down to religion. You can find the same in any power situation, such as politics or ideologies that purport to be atheist. Need I mention the former Soviet Union? So it is not a question of religion making people behave badly. It is a question of human beings getting power and then wanting more of it.\n\nIn the same vein, Atwood also declared that ""In the real world today, some religious groups are leading movements for the protection of vulnerable groups, including women.""[7] Atwood also draws connections between the ways in which Gilead\'s leaders maintain their power and other examples of actual totalitarian governments. In her interviews, Atwood offers up Afghanistan as an example of a religious theocracy forcing women out of the public sphere and into their homes, as in Gilead.[11][9] The ""state-sanctioned murder of dissidents"" was inspired by the Philippines, and the last General Secretary of the Romanian Communist Party Nicolae Ceau\xc8\x99escu\'s obsession with increasing the birth rate (Decree 770) led to the strict policing of pregnant women and the outlawing of birth control and abortion.[11] However, Atwood clearly explains that many of these deplorable acts were not just present in other cultures and countries, ""but within Western society, and within the \'Christian\' tradition itself"".[14]\n\nThe Republic of Gilead struggles with infertility, making Offred\'s services as a Handmaid vital to producing children and thus reproducing the society. Handmaids themselves are ""untouchable"", but their ability to signify status is equated to that of slaves or servants throughout history.[14] Atwood connects their concerns with infertility to real-life problems our world faces, such as radiation, chemical pollution, and venereal disease (HIV/AIDS is specifically mentioned in the ""Historical Notes"" section at the end of the novel, which was a relatively new disease at the time of Atwood\'s writing whose long-term impact was still unknown). Atwood\'s strong stance on environmental issues and their negative consequences for our society has presented itself in other works such as her MaddAddam trilogy, and refers back to her growing up with biologists and her own scientific curiosity.[17]\n\nCharacters [ edit ]\n\nOffred [ edit ]\n\nOffred is the protagonist and narrator who takes the readers through life in Gilead. She was labeled a ""wanton woman"" when Gilead was established because she had married a man who was divorced. All divorces were nullified by the new government, meaning her husband was now considered still married to his first wife, making Offred an adulteress. In trying to escape Gilead, she was separated from her husband and daughter. She is part of the first generation of Gilead\'s women, those who remember pre-Gilead times. Proved fertile, she is considered an important commodity and has been placed as a ""handmaid"" in the home of ""the Commander"" and his wife Serena Joy, to bear a child for them (Serena Joy is believed to be infertile).[18] Readers are able to see Offred\'s resistance of The Republic of Gilead on the inside through her thoughts.\n\nOffred is a slave name that describes her function: she is ""of Fred"" (i.e., she belongs to Fred \xe2\x80\x93 presumed to be the name of the Commander \xe2\x80\x93 and is considered a concubine). In the novel, Offred says that she is not a concubine, but a tool; a ""two legged womb"". The Handmaids\' names say nothing about who the women really are; their only identity is as the Commander\'s property. ""Offred"" is also a pun on the word ""offered"", as in ""offered as a sacrifice"", and ""of red"" because the red dress assigned for the handmaids in Gilead.[19]\n\nIn Atwood\'s original novel, Offred\'s real name is never revealed; however, Volker Schl\xc3\xb6ndorff\'s 1990 film adaptation gave Offred the real name Kate,[20] while the television series gave her the real name June.\n\nThe women in training to be Handmaids whisper names across their beds at night. The names are ""Alma. Janine. Dolores. Moira. June,"" and all are later accounted for except June. In addition, one of the Aunts tells the handmaids-in-training to stop ""mooning and June-ing"". From this and other references, some readers have inferred that her birth name could be ""June"".[22] Miner suggests that ""June"" is a pseudonym. As ""Mayday"" is the name of the Gilead resistance, June could be an invention by the protagonist. The Nunavut conference covered in the epilogue takes place in June.[23] When the Hulu TV series chose to state outright that Offred\'s real name is June, Atwood wrote that it was not her original intention to imply that Offred\'s real name is June ""but it fits, so readers are welcome to it if they wish"".[7] The revelation of Offred\'s real name serves only to humanize her in the presence of the other Handmaids.\n\nThe Commander [ edit ]\n\nThe Commander says that he was a scientist and was previously involved in something similar to market research before Gilead\'s inception. Later, it is hypothesized, but not confirmed, that he might have been one of the architects of the Republic and its laws. Presumably, his first name is ""Fred"", though that, too, may be a pseudonym. He engages in forbidden intellectual pursuits with Offred, such as playing Scrabble, and introduces her to a secret club that serves as a brothel for high-ranking officers. Offred learns that the Commander carried on a similar relationship with his previous handmaid, who later killed herself when his wife found out.\n\nIn the epilogue, Professor Peixoto speculates that one of two figures, both instrumental in the establishment of Gilead, may have been the Commander, based on the name ""Fred"". It is his belief that the Commander was a man named Frederick R. Waterford who was killed in a purge shortly after Offred was taken away, charged with harbouring an enemy agent.\n\nSerena Joy [ edit ]\n\nSerena Joy is a former televangelist and the Commander\'s wife in the fundamentalist theonomy. The state took away her power and public recognition, and tries to hide her past as a television figure. Offred identifies Serena Joy by recalling seeing her on TV when she was a little girl early on Saturday mornings while waiting for the cartoons to air. Believed to be sterile (although the suggestion is made that the Commander is sterile, Gileadean laws attribute sterility only to women), she is forced to accept that he has use of a handmaid. She resents having to take part in ""The Ceremony"", a monthly fertility ritual. She strikes a deal with Offred to arrange for her to have sex with Nick in order to become pregnant. According to Professor Pieixoto in the epilogue, ""Serena Joy"" or ""Pam"" are pseudonyms; the character\'s real name is implied to be Thelma.\n\nOfglen [ edit ]\n\nOfglen is a neighbour of Offred\'s and a fellow Handmaid. She is partnered with Offred to do the daily shopping. Handmaids are never alone and are expected to police each other\'s behaviour. Ofglen is a member of the Mayday resistance. In contrast to Offred, she is daring. She knocks out a Mayday spy who is to be tortured and killed in order to save him the pain of a violent death. Offred is told that when Ofglen vanishes, it is because she has committed suicide before the government can take her into custody due to her membership in the resistance, possibly to avoid giving away any information.\n\nA new handmaid, also called Ofglen, takes Ofglen\'s place, and is assigned as Offred\'s shopping partner. She threatens Offred against any thought of resistance. In addition, she breaks protocol by telling her what happened to the first Ofglen.\n\nNick [ edit ]\n\nNick is the Commander\'s chauffeur, who lives above the garage. By Serena Joy\'s arrangement, he and Offred start a sexual relationship to increase her chance of getting pregnant. If she were unable to bear the Commander a child, she would be declared sterile and shipped to the ecological wastelands of the Colonies. Offred begins to develop feelings for him. Nick is an ambiguous character, and Offred does not know if he is a party loyalist or part of the resistance, though he identifies himself as the latter. The epilogue suggests that he really was part of the resistance, and aided Offred in escaping the Commander\'s house.\n\nMoira [ edit ]\n\nMoira has been a close friend of Offred\'s since college. In the novel, their relationship represents a female friendship that the Republic of Gilead tries to block. A lesbian, she has resisted the homophobia of Gilead society. Moira is taken to be a Handmaid soon after Offred. She escapes by stealing an Aunt\'s pass and clothes, but Offred later finds her working as a prostitute in a party-run brothel. She was caught and chose the brothel rather than to be sent to the Colonies. Moira exemplifies defiance against Gilead by rejecting every value that is forced onto the citizens.\n\nLuke [ edit ]\n\nLuke was Offred\'s husband before the formation of Gilead, having divorced his first wife to marry her. Under Gilead, all divorces were retroactively nullified, resulting in Offred being considered an adulteress and their daughter illegitimate. Offred was forced to become a Handmaid and her daughter was given to a loyalist family. Since their attempt to escape to Canada, Offred has heard nothing of Luke. She wavers between believing him dead or imprisoned.\n\nProfessor Pieixoto [ edit ]\n\nPieixoto is the ""co-discoverer [with Professor Knotly Wade] of Offred\'s tapes"". In his presentation at an academic conference, he talks about ""the \'Problems of Authentication in Reference to The Handmaid\'s Tale\'"".[18] Pieixoto is therefore the person who is retelling Offred\'s story, and so makes the narration even more unreliable than it was originally.\n\nSetting [ edit ]\n\nThe novel is set in an indeterminate dystopian future, speculated to be around the year 2005,[24] with a fundamentalist theonomy ruling the territory of what had been the United States but is now the Republic of Gilead. Individuals are segregated by categories and dressed according to their social functions. Complex dress codes play a key role in imposing social control within the new society and serve to distinguish people by sex, occupation, and caste.\n\nThe action takes place in what once was the Harvard Square neighbourhood of Cambridge, Massachusetts;[26] Atwood studied at Radcliffe College, located in this area.\n\nPolitics [ edit ]\n\nIn Gilead, the bodies of fertile women are politicized and controlled. The North American population is falling as more men and women become infertile (though in Gilead, legally, it is only women who can be the cause of infertility). Gilead\'s treatment of women is based upon a fundamentalist interpretation of the Bible, meaning that women are the property of and subordinate to their husband, father, or head of household. They are not allowed to do anything that would grant them any power independent of this system. They are not allowed to vote, hold a job, read, possess money, or own anything, among many other restrictions.\n\nA particular quote from The Handmaid\'s Tale sums this up: ""The Republic of Gilead, said Aunt Lydia, knows no bounds. Gilead is within you"" (HT 5.2). This describes that there is no way around the societal bounds of women in this new state of government. Handmaids, being not allowed to wed, are given two-year assignments with a commander, and lose their own name: they are called ""Of [their Commander\'s first name]"", such as the novel\'s protagonist, known only as Offred. When a handmaid is reassigned, her name changes with her. Their original identities are suppressed. However, while being re-educated as handmaids, they surreptitiously share their names with each other.\n\nIn this book, the government appears to be strong though ""no one in Gilead seems to be a true believer in its revolution"" (Beauchamp). The Commanders, portrayed via Commander Fred, do not agree with their own doctrines. The commander takes Offred at one point to a brothel in order to have sex with her in an informal setting apart from the Ceremony. The wives, portrayed via Serena Joy, former television evangelist, disobey the rules set forth by their commander husbands. Serena smokes black market cigarettes, expresses the forbidden idea that men may be infertile, and schemes to get Offred impregnated by her chauffeur.\n\nReligion [ edit ]\n\nBruce Miller, the executive producer of The Handmaid\'s Tale television serial, declared with regard to Atwood\'s book, as well as his series, that Gilead is ""a society that\xe2\x80\x99s based kind of in a perverse misreading of Old Testament laws and codes"".[27] The author explains that Gilead tries to embody the ""utopian idealism"" present in 20th-century regimes, as well as earlier New England Puritanism.[14] Both Atwood and Miller stated that the people running Gilead are ""not genuinely Christian"".[28][27] The group running Gilead, according to Atwood, is ""not really interested in religion; they\'re interested in power.""[16] In fact, in her prayers to God, Offred reflects on Gilead and prays \xe2\x80\x9cI don\'t believe for an instant that what\'s going on out there is what You meant.... I suppose I should say I forgive whoever did this, and whatever they\xe2\x80\x99re doing now. I\xe2\x80\x99ll try, but it isn\'t easy.\xe2\x80\x9d[29] Margaret Atwood, writing on this, says that ""Offred herself has a private version of the Lord\'s Prayer and refuses to believe that this regime has been mandated by a just and merciful God.""[30]\n\nChristian churches that do not support the actions of the Sons of Jacob are systematically demolished, and the people living in Gilead are never seen attending church.[27] Christian denominations, including Quakers, Baptists and Roman Catholics, are specifically named as enemies of the Sons of Jacob.[16][27] Nuns who refuse conversion are considered ""Unwomen"" and banished to the Colonies, owing to their reluctance to marry and refusal (or inability) to bear children. Priests unwilling to convert are executed and hanged from the Wall. Atwood pits Quaker Christians against the regime by having them help the oppressed, something she feels they would do in reality: ""The Quakers have gone underground, and are running an escape route to Canada, as\xe2\x80\x94I suspect\xe2\x80\x94they would.""[30]\n\nJews are named an exception and classified Sons of Jacob. Offred observes that Jews refusing to convert are allowed to emigrate from Gilead to Israel, and most choose to leave. However, in the epilogue, Professor Pieixoto reveals that many of the emigrating Jews ended up being dumped into the sea while on the ships ostensibly tasked with transporting them to Israel, due to privatization of the ""repatriation program"" and capitalists\' effort to maximize profits. Offred mentions that many Jews who chose to stay were caught secretly practicing Judaism and executed.\n\nLegitimate women [ edit ]\n\nWives The top social level permitted to women, achieved by marriage to higher-ranking officers. Wives always wear blue dresses and cloaks, suggesting traditional depictions of the Virgin Mary in historic Christian art. When a Commander dies, his Wife becomes a Widow and must dress in black.\n\nDaughters The natural or adopted children of the ruling class. They wear white until marriage, which is arranged by the government. The narrator\'s daughter may have been adopted by an infertile Wife and Commander and she is shown in a photograph wearing a long white dress.\n\n[7] The bonnets that Handmaids wear are modelled on Old Dutch Cleanser\'s faceless mascot, which Atwood in childhood found frightening.\n\nFertile women whose social function is to bear children for infertile Wives. Handmaids dress in ankle-length red dresses, white caps, and heavy boots. In summer, they change into lighter-weight (but still ankle-length) dresses and slatted shoes. When in public, in winter, they wear ankle-length red cloaks, red gloves, and heavy white bonnets, which they call ""wings"" because the sides stick out, blocking their peripheral vision and shielding their faces from view. Handmaids are women of proven fertility who have broken the law. The law includes both gender crimes, such as lesbianism; and religious crimes, such as adultery (redefined to include sexual relationships with divorced partners since divorce is no longer legal). The Republic of Gilead justifies the use of the handmaids for procreation by referring to two biblical stories: Genesis 30:1\xe2\x80\x9313 and Genesis 16:1\xe2\x80\x934. In the first story, Jacob\'s infertile wife Rachel offers up her handmaid Bilhah to be a surrogate mother on her behalf, and then her sister Leah does the same with her own handmaid Zilpah (even though Leah has already given Jacob many sons). In the other story, which appears earlier in Genesis but is cited less frequently, Abraham has sex with his wife\'s handmaid, Hagar. Handmaids are assigned to Commanders and live in their houses. When unassigned, they live at training centers. Handmaids who successfully bear children continue to live at their commander\'s house until their children are weaned, at which point they are sent to a new assignment. Those who do produce children, however, will never be declared ""Unwomen"" or sent to the Colonies, even if they never have another baby.\n\nAunts Trainers of the Handmaids. They dress in brown. Aunts promote the role of Handmaid as an honorable way for a sinful woman to redeem herself. They also police the Handmaids, beating some and ordering the maiming of others. The aunts have an unusual amount of autonomy, compared to other women of Gilead. They are the only class of women permitted to read although this is only to fulfil the administrative aspect of their role. (""The Aunts are allowed to read and write."" Vintage Books, p. 139. However, on p. 100 of the Vintage Books edition: ""They played it (the Beatitudes) from a disc; the voice was a man\'s."" In the Anchor Books edition: ""They played it (the Beatitudes) from a tape, so not even an Aunt would be guilty of the sin of reading. The voice was a man\'s. (p.89.)"")\n\nMarthas They are older, infertile women who have domestic skills and are compliant, making them suitable as servants. They dress in green smocks. The title of ""Martha"" is based on the story of Jesus at the home of Martha and Mary (Gospel of Luke 10:38\xe2\x80\x9342), where Jesus visits Mary, sister of Lazarus and Martha; Mary listens to Jesus while Martha works at ""all the preparations that had to be made"".\n\nEconowives Women married to men of lower-rank, not members of the elite. They are expected to perform all the female functions: domestic duties, companionship, and child-bearing. Their dress is multicoloured red, blue, and green to reflect these multiple roles, and is made of notably cheaper material.\n\nThe division of labour among the women generates some resentment. Marthas, Wives and Econowives perceive Handmaids as promiscuous and are taught to scorn them. Offred mourns that the women of the various groups have lost their ability to empathize with each other. They are divided in their oppression.\n\nThe Ceremony [ edit ]\n\n""The Ceremony"" is a non-marital sexual act sanctioned for reproduction. The ritual requires the Handmaid to lie on her back between the legs of the Wife during the sex act as if they were one person. The Wife has to invite the Handmaid to share her power this way; many Wives consider this both humiliating and offensive. Offred describes the ceremony:\n\nMy red skirt is hitched up to my waist, though no higher. Below it the Commander is fucking. What he is fucking is the lower part of my body. I do not say making love, because this is not what he\'s doing. Copulating too would be inaccurate because it would imply two people and only one is involved. Nor does rape cover it: nothing is going on here that I haven\'t signed up for.\n\nGenre classification [ edit ]\n\nThe Handmaid\xe2\x80\x99s Tale is a feminist dystopian novel,[32][33] combining the characteristics of dystopian fiction: \xe2\x80\x9ca genre that projects an imaginary society that differs from the author\xe2\x80\x99s own, first, by being significantly worse in important respects and second by being worse because it attempts to reify some utopian ideal,\xe2\x80\x9d[34] with the feminist utopian ideal which: \xe2\x80\x9csees men or masculine systems as the major cause of social and political problems (e.g. war), and presents women as not only at least the equals of men but also as the sole arbiters of their reproductive functions.[35][36] The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction notes that dystopian images are almost invariably images of future society, \xe2\x80\x9cpointing fearfully at the way the world is supposedly going in order to provide urgent propaganda for a change in direction.\xe2\x80\x9d[37] Atwood\'s stated intent was indeed to dramatize potential consequences of current trends.[38]\n\nIn 1985, reviewers hailed the book as a ""feminist 1984,""[39] citing similarities between the totalitarian regimes under which both protagonists live, and \xe2\x80\x9cthe distinctively modern sense of nightmare come true, the initial paralyzed powerlessness of the victim unable to act.\xe2\x80\x9d[40] Scholarly studies have expanded on the place of The Handmaid\xe2\x80\x99s Tale in the dystopian and feminist traditions.[40][9][41][10][39]\n\nThe classification of utopian and dystopian fiction as a sub-genre of the collective term, speculative fiction, alongside science fiction, fantasy, and horror is a relatively recent convention. (See also: The Internet Speculative Fiction Database) Dystopian novels have long been discussed as a type of science fiction, however, with publication of The Handmaid\'s Tale, Atwood distinguished the terms science fiction and speculative fiction quite intentionally. In interviews and essays, she has discussed why, observing:\n\nI like to make a distinction between science fiction proper and speculative fiction. For me, the science fiction label belongs on books with things in them that we can\'t yet do, such as going through a wormhole in space to another universe; and speculative fiction means a work that employs the means already to hand, such as DNA identification and credit cards, and that takes place on Planet Earth. But the terms are fluid.[42]\n\nAtwood acknowledges that others may use the terms interchangeably, but she notes her interest in this type of work is to explore themes in ways that ""realistic fiction"" cannot do.[42]\n\nAmong a few science fiction aficionados, however, Atwood\'s comments were considered petty and contemptuous. (The term speculative fiction was indeed employed that way by certain New Wave writers in the 1960s and early 1970s to express their dissatisfaction with traditional or establishment science fiction.) Hugo-winning science fiction critic David Langford observed in a column: ""The Handmaid\'s Tale won the very first Arthur C. Clarke Award in 1987. She\'s been trying to live this down ever since.""[43]\n\nCritical reception [ edit ]\n\nThe Handmaid\'s Tale was well received by critics, helping to cement Atwood\'s status as a prominent writer of the 20th century. Not only was the book deemed well-written and compelling, but Atwood\'s work was notable for sparking intense debates both in and out of academia.[8] Atwood maintains that the Republic of Gilead is only an extrapolation of trends already seen in the United States at the time of her writing, a view supported by other scholars studying The Handmaid\'s Tale.[44] Indeed, many have placed The Handmaid\'s Tale in the same category of dystopian fiction as Nineteen Eighty-Four and Brave New World,[11] with the added feature of confronting patriarchy, a categorization that Atwood has accepted and reiterated in many articles and interviews.[12]\n\nEven today, many reviewers hold that Atwood\'s novel remains as foreboding and powerful as ever, largely because of its basis in historical fact.[13][15] Yet when her book was first published in 1985, not all reviewers were convinced of the ""cautionary tale"" Atwood presented. For example, Mary McCarthy\'s New York Times review argued that The Handmaid\'s Tale lacked the ""surprised recognition"" necessary for readers to see ""our present selves in a distorting mirror, of what we may be turning into if current trends are allowed to continue"".[17]\n\nIn the aftermath of the television series\' debut in 2017, there has been much debate on parallels drawn between the series (and by extension, this book) and American society following the election of Donald Trump as President of the United States and that of Mike Pence as Vice President.[45][46]\n\nAnalysis [ edit ]\n\nFeminist analysis [ edit ]\n\nMuch of the discussion about The Handmaid\'s Tale has centered on its categorization as feminist literature. Atwood does not see the Republic of Gilead as a purely feminist dystopia, as not all men have greater rights than women.[14] Instead, this society presents a typical dictatorship: ""shaped like a pyramid, with the powerful of both sexes at the apex, the men generally outranking the women at the same level; then descending levels of power and status with men and women in each, all the way down to the bottom, where the unmarried men must serve in the ranks before being awarded an Econowife"".[14] Econowives are women married to men that don\'t belong to the elite and who are expected to carry out child-bearing, domestic duties, and traditional companionship. When asked about whether her book was feminist, Atwood stated that the presence of women and what happens to them are important to the structure and theme of the book. This aisle of feminism, by default, would make a lot of books feminist. However, she was adamant in her stance that her book did not represent the brand of feminism that victimizes or strips women of moral choice.[47] Additionally, Atwood has argued that while some of the observations that informed the content of The Handmaid\'s Tale may be feminist, her novel is not meant to say ""one thing to one person"" or serve as a political message\xe2\x80\x94instead, The Handmaid\'s Tale is ""a study of power, and how it operates and how it deforms or shapes the people who are living within that kind of regime"".[11][12]\n\nSome scholars have offered such a feminist interpretation, however, connecting Atwood\'s use of religious fundamentalism in the pages of The Handmaid\'s Tale to a condemnation of their presence in current American society.[48][49] Atwood goes on to describe her book as not a critique of religion, but a critique of the use of religion as a ""front for tyranny.""[50] Yet others have argued that The Handmaid\'s Tale critiques typical notions of feminism, as Atwood\'s novel appears to subvert the traditional ""women helping women"" ideals of the movement and turn toward the possibility of ""the matriarchal network ... and a new form of misogyny: women\'s hatred of women"".[51] Scholars have analyzed and made connections to patriarchal oppression in The Handmaid\'s Tale and oppression of women today. Aisha Matthews tackles the effects of institutional structures that oppress woman and womanhood and connects those to the themes present in The Handmaid\'s Tale. She first asserts that structures and social frameworks, such as the patriarchy and societal role of traditional Christian values, are inherently detrimental to the liberation of womanhood. She then makes the connection to the relationship between Offred, Serena Joy, and their Commander, explaining that through this ""perversion of traditional marriage, the Biblical story of Rachel, Jacob, and Bilhah is taken too literally."" Their relationship and other similar relationships in The Handmaid\'s Tale mirror the effects of patriarchal standards of womanliness.[52]\n\nSex and occupation [ edit ]\n\nThe sexes are strictly divided. Gilead\'s society values white women\'s reproductive commodities over those of other ethnicities. Women are categorized ""hierarchically according to class status and reproductive capacity"" as well as ""metonymically colour-coded according to their function and their labour"" (Kauffman 232). The Commander expresses his personal opinion that women are considered inferior to men, as the men are in a position where they have power to control society.\n\nWomen are segregated by clothing, as are men. With rare exception, men wear military or paramilitary uniforms. All classes of men and women are defined by the colours they wear, drawing on colour symbolism and psychology. All lower-status individuals are regulated by this dress code. All ""non-persons"" are banished to the ""Colonies"". Sterile, unmarried women are considered to be non-persons. Both men and women sent there wear grey dresses.\n\nThe women, particularly the handmaids, are stripped of their individual identities as they lack formal names, taking on their assigned commander\'s first name in most cases. This hierarchical society has forced women to come to terms with their inability to make decisions about their own bodies and lives.\n\nUnwomen [ edit ]\n\nSterile women, the unmarried, some widows, feminists, lesbians, nuns, and politically dissident women: all women who are incapable of social integration within the Republic\'s strict gender divisions. Gilead exiles Unwomen to ""the Colonies"", areas both of agricultural production and deadly pollution. Joining them are handmaids who fail to bear a child after three two-year assignments.\n\nJezebels [ edit ]\n\nJezebels are women who are forced to become prostitutes and entertainers. They are available only to the Commanders and to their guests. Offred portrays Jezebels as attractive and educated; they may be unsuitable as handmaids due to temperament. They have been sterilized, a surgery that is forbidden to other women. They operate in unofficial but state-sanctioned brothels, unknown to most women. Jezebels, whose title also comes from the Bible (note Queen Jezebel in the Books of Kings), dress in the remnants of sexualized costumes from ""the time before"", such as cheerleaders\' costumes, school uniforms, and Playboy Bunny costumes. Jezebels can wear make-up, drink alcohol and socialize with men, but are tightly controlled by the Aunts. When they pass their sexual prime and/or their looks fade, they are discarded without any precision as to whether they are killed or sent to the Colonies in the novel.\n\nRace analysis [ edit ]\n\nAfrican Americans, the main non-white ethnic group in this society, are called the Children of Ham. A state TV broadcast mentions they have been relocated ""en masse"" to ""National Homelands"" in the Midwest, which are suggestive of the apartheid-era homelands (Bantustans) set up by South Africa. Ana Cottle characterized The Handmaid\'s Tale as ""white feminism"", noting that Atwood does away with black people in a few lines by relocating the ""Children of Ham"" while borrowing heavily from the African-American experience and applying it to white women.[53][54] It is implied that Native Americans living in territories under the rule of Gilead are exterminated. Jews are given a choice between converting to the state religion or being ""repatriated"" to Israel. However, converts who were subsequently discovered with any symbolic representations or artifacts of Judaism were executed, and the repatriation scheme was privatized.\n\nMany argue that readers cannot simply ignore the parallels between racism and sexism within The Handmaid\'s Tale. Many critics believe that Atwood chooses to erase the black community from the novel by sending them elsewhere in order to make the Republic of Gilead a white society. Scholar Ben Merriman believes that Atwood\'s portrayal of society in The Handmaid\'s Tale mimics that of a society run on black slavery, due to the novel\'s heavy focuses on ""sexual exploitation, isolation, and compelled ignorance that accompany severe economic and political powerlessness"", which are themes often associated with African-American slavery. Merriman accuses Atwood of purposely failing to acknowledge the parallels between her novel and the African-American experience. In Gilead, Handmaids are forbidden to read or write and the men in charge control access to literacy. In black slavery, African-Americans had restrictions on literacy as well. Additionally, The Handmaid\'s Tale is written as an oral narration of Offred\'s experiences; oral narration is a theme commonly associated with slave narratives.[55]\n\nLanguage analysis [ edit ]\n\nIn the novel\'s fictional fundamentalist society, sterile is an outlawed word. In this society, there is no such thing as a sterile man. In this culture, women are either fruitful or barren, the latter of which are declared to be ""unwomen"" and are sent to the colonies with the rest of the ""unwomen"" to do life-threatening work until their death, which is, on average, three years.\n\nAtwood emphasises how changes in context affect behaviours and attitudes by repeating the phrase ""Context is all"" throughout the novel, establishing this precept as a motif. Playing the game of Scrabble with her Commander illustrates the key significance of changes in ""context""; once ""the game of old men and women"", the game became forbidden for women to play and therefore ""desirable"". Through living in a morally rigid society, Offred has come to perceive the world differently from earlier. Offred expresses amazement at how ""It has taken so little time to change our minds about things"". Wearing revealing clothes and makeup had been part of her former life, but when she sees Japanese tourists dressed that way, she now feels the women are inappropriately dressed.\n\nOffred can read but not translate the phrase ""nolite te bastardes carborundorum"" carved into the closet wall of her small bedroom; this mock-Latin aphorism signifies ""Don\'t let the bastards grind you down"".\n\nAwards [ edit ]\n\nAcademic reception [ edit ]\n\nAtwood\'s novels, and especially her works of speculative fiction, The Handmaid\'s Tale and Oryx and Crake, are frequently offered as examples for the final, open-ended question on the North American Advanced Placement English Literature and Composition exam each year.[61] As such, her books are often assigned in high-school classrooms to students taking this Advanced Placement course, despite the mature themes the work presents. Atwood herself has expressed surprise that her books are being assigned to high-school audiences, largely due to her own censored education in the 1950s, but she has assured readers that this increased attention from high-school students has not altered the material she has chosen to write about since.[62]\n\nChallenges [ edit ]\n\nBecause the book has been frequently challenged or banned in some of the United States of America over the last thirty years, many people have expressed discontent at The Handmaid\'s Tale\'s presence in the classroom. Some of these challenges have come from parents concerned about the explicit sexuality and other adult themes represented in the book. Others have argued that The Handmaid\'s Tale depicts a negative view of religion, a view supported by several academics who propose that Atwood\'s work satirizes contemporary religious fundamentalists in the United States, offering a feminist critique of the trends this movement to the Right represents.[48][49]\n\nThe American Library Association (ALA) lists The Handmaid\'s Tale as number 37 on the ""100 Most Frequently Challenged Books of 1990\xe2\x80\x932000"".[63] Atwood participated in discussing The Handmaid\'s Tale as the subject of an ALA discussion series titled ""One Book, One Conference"".[64]\n\nSome complaints have included:\n\n2009 Toronto District School Board. Report in The Star, 16 January, 2009: ""Atwood novel too brutal, sexist for school: Parent"", by Kristin Rushowy, Education Reporter.\n\nThe Handmaid\'s Tale wasn\'t likely written for 17-year-olds, but neither are a lot of things we teach in high school, like Shakespeare... And they are all the better for reading it. They are on the edge of adulthood already, and there\'s no point in coddling them,"" he said, adding, ""they aren\'t coddled in terms of mass media today anyway""... He said the book has been accused of being anti-Christian and, more recently, anti-Islamic because the women are veiled and polygamy is allowed... But that ""misses the point"", said Brown. ""It\'s really anti-fundamentalism.""[66]\n\nIn her earlier account (14 January 2009), Star reporter Kristin Rushowy commented that a Toronto District School Board committee was ""reviewing the novel"". While noting that ""The Handmaid\'s Tale is listed as one of the 100 \'most frequently challenged books\' from 1990 to 1999 on the American Library Association\'s website"", Rushowy reports that ""The Canadian Library Association says there is \'no known instance of a challenge to this novel in Canada\' but says the book was called anti-Christian and pornographic by parents after being placed on a reading list for secondary students in Texas in the 1990s.""[67]\n\nNovember 2012 Guilford County, North Carolina, where two parents protested against the inclusion of the book on a required reading list at a local high school. The parents presented the school board with a petition signed by 2,300 people, prompting a review of the book by the school\'s media advisory committee. According to local news reports, one of the parents said ""she felt Christian students are bullied in society, in that they\'re made to feel uncomfortable about their beliefs by non-believers. She said including books like The Handmaid\'s Tale contributes to that discomfort, because of its negative view on religion and its anti-biblical attitudes toward sex.""[68]\n\nIn higher education [ edit ]\n\nIn institutions of higher education, professors have found The Handmaid\'s Tale to be useful, largely because of its historical and religious basis and Atwood\'s captivating delivery. The novel\'s teaching points include: introducing politics and the social sciences to students in a more concrete way;[69][70] demonstrating the importance of reading to our freedom, both intellectual and political;[71] and acknowledging the ""most insidious and violent manifestations of power in Western history"" in a compelling manner.[72] The chapter entitled ""Historical Notes"" at the end of the novel also represents a warning to academics who run the risk of misreading and misunderstanding historical texts, pointing to the satirized Professor Pieixoto as an example of a male scholar who has taken over and overpowered Offred\'s narrative with his own interpretation.[73]\n\nIn other media [ edit ]\n\nAudio [ edit ]\n\nAn audiobook of the unabridged text, read by Claire Danes ( ISBN 9781491519110), won the 2013 Audie Award for fiction.

"b'1996 film\n\nThat Thing You Do! is a 1996 American comedy film starring, written and directed by Tom Hanks, in his directorial debut. It tells the story of the rise and fall of a fictional 1960s one-hit wonder pop band, and it also stars Tom Everett Scott, Liv Tyler, Johnathon Schaech, Steve Zahn and Ethan Embry. The film also resulted in a musical hit with the titular song of the same name, which was nominated for an Academy Award and a Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song.[2]\n\nPlot [ edit ]\n\nIn 1964, Guy Patterson, an aspiring jazz drummer, is working in his family\'s appliance store when he is asked by acquaintances Jimmy Mattingly and Lenny Haise to sit in with their new pop-rock band at a local talent show after their regular drummer is injured. The band adopts the name ""The Oneders"" (pronounced ""wonders"", but often mispronounced ""oh-NEE-ders"") because Jimmy likes names that contain wordplay, like The Beatles. At the talent show, Guy launches into a faster tempo than Jimmy intended for his original song, ""That Thing You Do"". Jimmy is upset, but Guy\'s version wins them the talent show.\n\nThe Oneders\' performance at the talent show earns them a paying gig at Villapiano\'s, a local pizza place. When a fan asks for a record, they decide to record the song and sell 45s of it. Local talent promoter Phil Horace takes notice of the band and promises to get their record played on the radio within 10 days. Lenny convinces the band to sign with Phil.\n\nPhil gets the song on Pennsylvania radio and books the band at a rock & roll showcase concert in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. They encounter technical difficulties, however, and are booed by the crowd. After the showcase, Phil brings a dispirited Guy to meet with Mr. White, an A&R representative for Playtone Records, who offers the band a contract and takes over as their manager. Mr. White re-spells the band\'s name as ""The Wonders,"" offers them advice on style and presentation (including insisting that Guy should always wear sunglasses), asks them to join the Play-Tone tour of Midwestern state fairs, and suggests that Jimmy\'s girlfriend Faye join the tour as their ""costume mistress.""\n\nDuring the tour, The Wonders meet other acts, learn about the business, and become better performers. Jimmy spends time with a chanteuse while the bassist falls for a member of a girl group, The Chantrellines. ""That Thing You Do"" garners national radio airplay and the band\'s popularity soars. While most of the band enjoys their taste of fame, Jimmy is itching to get back in the studio.\n\nWhen ""That Thing You Do"" reaches #7 on the Billboard charts. Mr. White sends them to Los Angeles, California to do publicity, including radio and film appearances.\n\nOn the day of the band\'s appearance on The Hollywood Television Showcase, a nationally televised live variety show, things start to go awry. The bassist is nowhere to be found, so Mr. White replaces him with an older, experienced session bassist known as ""Wolfman"". Guy is hungover; Jimmy is throwing up due to nerves; Lenny is preoccupied with his new girlfriend. Still, the Wonders manage to pull it together for their high-profile television appearance. When television captions introduce the members of the band, Jimmy\'s caption reads ""Careful, girls, he\'s engaged!""\n\nAfter the performance, Jimmy lashes out at Faye in the dressing room, insinuating that she was responsible for the ""engaged"" caption (although White implies that it was his doing). Jimmy insists that they are not engaged and he has no intention of proposing. Faye breaks up with him.\n\nThe next day, at a scheduled recording session, the original bassist is still missing and so is Lenny. Mr. White has provided new material for Jimmy and Guy to record, but Jimmy wants to do his original songs. When Mr. White reminds him that the terms of their contract allow Play-Tone to dictate their material, Jimmy quits the band on the spot. Guy is now the only remaining Wonder. Mr. White assures him that such things are common in the music industry.\n\nGuy returns to the hotel to check out. Guy tells Faye he plans to stay in L.A., while she says she will go back to Erie. She goes out to the curb to call a cab. Guy chases after her and they kiss.\n\nAn epilogue reveals that Jimmy became a record producer; Lenny became a divorced hotel and casino manager in Nevada; the bassist earned a Purple Heart in Vietnam, then worked in construction in Orlando, Florida; and Guy and Faye are married with four children in Bainbridge Island, Washington, where Guy teaches jazz composition at a music conservatory that they founded.\n\nCast [ edit ]\n\nProduction and music [ edit ]\n\nThe movie features original music by Tom Hanks, Adam Schlesinger, Rick Elias, Scott Rogness, Mike Piccirillo, Gary Goetzman and Howard Shore. In the movie, The Wonders rise to brief stardom on the strength of ""That Thing You Do"", a song written as a wistful ballad but which becomes an uptempo rocker during the band\'s first performance at a talent show. Written and composed for the film by Adam Schlesinger, bassist for Fountains of Wayne and Ivy and released on the film\'s soundtrack, the song became a genuine hit for The Wonders in 1996 (the song peaked at #41 on the Billboard Hot 100, #22 on the Adult Contemporary charts, #18 on the Adult Top 40, and #24 on the Top 40 Mainstream charts). The track was nominated for a 1996 Golden Globe Award as well as a 1996 Academy Award for Best Original Song. Mike Viola of The Candy Butchers provided the lead vocals for the Wonders.\n\nIn the film, the title song is referenced with ""All My Only Dreams"" as the B-side. The actual 45 RPM single, released to record stores in North America, features ""Dance With Me Tonight"" as its B-side. The song has since been recorded by The Knack and Bubblegum Lemonade. The Wonders are also seen playing the song ""Little Wild One."" This was written by the band Gigolo Aunts as a ""faux-Beatles""-style tune at the request of their record label to be submitted for consideration for inclusion in the film.[3]\n\nFor the purpose of being able to convincingly perform The Wonders\' songs on-camera, Scott, Schaech, Zahn and Embry took several weeks of individual lessons, followed by daily practice as a group. Of the four, only Zahn and Embry had any prior experience of playing their assigned instruments. They eventually honed their performance to the point where extras on the set thought they were actually playing the songs, when in reality they were miming along to recordings by professional musicians.[4]\n\nThe song that plays during the film\'s opening credits, ""Lovin\' You Lots and Lots,"" is credited to the fictitious Norm Wooster Singers and was actually written by Hanks. This song is a send-up of Ray Conniff, Mitch Miller, and other practitioners of the ""beautiful music"" or proto-Muzak formats that were a staple of adult radio during the early \'60s such as on KPOL (AM) 1540 in Los Angeles.[5][6] Hanks also composed Guy\'s jazzy signature drum solo, ""I Am Spartacus.""\n\nThe ballad ""My World Is Over"" by Diane Dane seems inspired by the compositions of Burt Bacharach and Hal David; the vocal performance is reminiscent of Jackie DeShannon.\n\nThe Wonders\' bassist (played by Ethan Embry) is unnamed in the film; in the end credits, he is credited as ""T.B. Player"". This is short for ""The Bass Player"", and is a joke based on the perception that bass players are often unknown and unappreciated. Embry later provided his own take on the character\'s real name: ""I just said my name was Tobias, because he\xe2\x80\x99s ""such"" a Tobias. You just take the vowels out [and it\'s T.B.] His nickname was Toby, but his mom calls him Tobias. And his last name actually was Player, because he was a player, dude! That carousel ride with the Chantrellines? Total player.""[4]\n\nThe tour and TV appearance are done in the authentic style of rock bands of the mid-1960s, including Go-Go girls, elaborate sharing of microphones, and formal clothing in various matching colors.\n\nThe song ""Voyage Around the Moon"" by the fictional band Saturn 5 closely resembles ""Pipeline"" by The Chantays. The scene where The Wonders are miming the instrumental tune ""Shrimp Shack"" during the filming of a beach party film titled Weekend at Party Pier is an overt reference to the scene in Pajama Party wherein The Nooney Rickett 4 play the instrumental Beach Ball.[7][better source needed]\n\nThe movie was written at a time when Hanks was dealing with his own issues with increasing successes in his career. During his appearance on Inside the Actors Studio, Hanks said he told the studio, ""I\'m a big honkin\' star and you have to let me do what I want to do,"" to which the studio replied, ""You\'re absolutely right.""[citation needed]\n\nThe (real) Wonders [ edit ]\n\nThere were at least two real bands named the Wonders who made the record charts at various radio stations in the early 1960s. One had a ballad titled ""With These Hands"" (b/w ""Please Don\'t Cry""; Bamboo 523) that was played by KCRG in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, in the fall of 1962.[8]\n\nThe other Wonders had a regional hit record called ""Say There"" (b/w ""Marilyn""; Colpix 699), released by Colpix Records in August 1963.[9] Little is known about these Wonders, except that they were probably from Ohio or Pennsylvania; ""Say There"" hit the Top 20 at WCOL in Columbus, Ohio, and made the Top 30 at KQV in Pittsburgh.[10] (There is a scene in the film in which a disc jockey at WCOL is seen playing ""That Thing You Do!"")[11]\n\nReferences to the Beatles [ edit ]\n\nThe name ""The Oneders"" references the Beatles\' purposeful misspelling in their name.\n\nBoth bands lost their original bass player and replaced their original drummer (in the Beatles\' case, Stuart Sutcliffe and Pete Best, respectively).\n\nThe song ""That Thing You Do"" is portrayed as a ballad that was sped up and became a hit; the Beatles\' ""Please Please Me"" started as a ballad, was sped up, and became the group\'s first No. 1. [12]\n\nAccording to Tom Hanks, the film grew out of the idea of the Beatles\' breakthrough after Pete Best\'s firing. [13]\n\nThe ""Careful girls, he\'s engaged"" caption under Mattingly\'s name is a reference to the ""Sorry girls, he\'s married"" caption under John Lennon\'s name when the Beatles appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show .\n\n. Faye is mistaken for a fan and is prevented by the police from following the band. A similar incident happened to Cynthia Lennon, John Lennon\'s first wife.\n\nWhen Guy and Tina meet after she arrives at Villapiano\'s for the group\'s paying gig, the owner of the restaurant mockingly refers to Guy as \'Ringo\' and tells him that the group should have started their performing \'five minutes ago\'.\n\nWhen the band are guests on radio station KMPC Los Angeles, the DJ, as part of his introduction, says ""But hey! I got some exciting guests on my show today. Makers of a hit record - visitors from the east....oops, hold on girls. Not THOSE mop-tops!""\n\nWaiting for the nationally televised presentation of the group, former drummer Chad wonders about how many viewers would be watching and Guy\'s father answers asking him how many people saw the Beatles on The Ed Sullivan Show .\n\n. At the fictitious west-coast television broadcast the Hollywood Television Showcase , guest host Troy Chesterfield introduces The Wonders by saying, ""The latest rock and roll group to challenge The Beatles to a hair-combing contest,"" referencing the similarity in both bands\' unusual hair styles.\n\n, guest host Troy Chesterfield introduces The Wonders by saying, ""The latest rock and roll group to challenge The Beatles to a hair-combing contest,"" referencing the similarity in both bands\' unusual hair styles. In the extended version of the film, the act ""Paul Pope\'s Primitive Primates,"" which is only briefly mentioned in the theatrical cut, portrays four chimpanzees dressed up in suits and wigs, along with British accents, instruments, and the similar name ""The Chimples"" to mimic The Beatles.\n\nSoundtrack [ edit ]\n\nThe soundtrack album (released under the Play-Tone name in conjunction with Epic Records) was also a hit, peaking at #21 on the Billboard 200 albums chart. The CD artwork is a replica of the fictional Play-Tone label used in the movie, and the liner notes are done in a mockumentary style, as if the Wonders had been a real group and the events of the film had actually happened. Hanks later used the success of That Thing You Do! as a springboard to launch the actual Playtone Records label, through which the soundtracks of all his subsequent films, and other films like Bring It On and television programs like The Sopranos, were released as albums.\n\nTrack listing [ edit ]\n\nNo. Title Music Artist Length 1.

(Live at the Hollywood Television Showcase)"" Schlesinger The Wonders 2:54 Total length: 42:09\n\nReception [ edit ]\n\nBox office [ edit ]\n\nThe film grossed $25,857,416 domestically and $8,728,000 internationally for a total worldwide gross of $34,585,416.[1] The film debuted at No. 3.[14]\n\nCritical response [ edit ]\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 93% based on reviews from 58 critics, with an average rating of 7.22/10. The site\'s consensus reads, ""A light, sweet, and thoroughly entertaining debut for director Tom Hanks, That Thing You Do! makes up in charm what it lacks in complexity"".[15] On Metacritic the film has a score of 71 out of 100 based on reviews from 22 critics, indicating ""generally favorable reviews"".[16]\n\nEmanuel Levy of Variety called it ""A top-notch production, exuberant period music and Hanks the actor in an important role cunningly disguise a rather slight and inconsequential narrative.""[17] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave it 3 out of 4 and wrote: ""The movie may be inconsequential, but in some ways that\'s a strength. Without hauling in a lot of deep meanings, it remembers with great warmth a time and a place.""[18]\n\nAccolades [ edit ]\n\nThe film is recognized by the American Film Institute in this list:\n\nHome media [ edit ]\n\nInitial release [ edit ]\n\nThat Thing You Do! was first released in mid-1997 on VHS. In 1998, the film became available in the DIVX format (as with all 20th Century Fox films), rather than DVD.\n\nFirst DVD [ edit ]\n\nAfter DIVX failed, the film was released onto DVD on June 5, 2001. It included the featurette ""The Making of That Thing You Do!,"" and two music videos.\n\nExtended Edition DVD [ edit ]\n\nOn May 8, 2007, Tom Hanks\' Extended Edition was released on DVD. The film\'s theatrical cut and an extended cut with 39 additional minutes of deleted scenes are included.\n\nMany of the deleted scenes are devoted to character development. A tastefully steamy look at Guy\'s ""make-out"" session with Tina at his apartment is included. The extended version also goes more in-depth with Guy\'s developing relationship with Faye (via mild flirting) and his deteriorating relationship with Tina, as well as Tina\'s budding relationship with her dentist, Dr. Collins. It also suggests that the character portrayed by Tom Hanks (Mr. White) is not only gay but in a relationship with a man played by former NFL defensive lineman Howie Long.[20]\n\nMore camera time is also devoted to the tryst between the bass player and one of the singers of the Chantrellines. In the theatrical cut, this romance was depicted mainly as an unrequited crush on the part of the bass player; in the extended cut it is clearly shown that his efforts were successful.\n\nAt the end of the Extended Edition, rather than becoming a studio drummer on the recommendation of Del Paxton, Guy becomes a disc jockey for the jazz station KJZZ and records a documentary series of interviews with legendary jazz musicians.\n\n2007 DVD repackage re-release [ edit ]\n\nThat Thing You Do! was packaged with Bachelor Party and The Man with One Red Shoe in the Tom Hanks Triple Feature DVD anthology set. The actual DVD appears to be the original 2001 disc, with the featurette and music videos.\n\nBlu-ray release [ edit ]\n\n20th Century Fox Home Entertainment released the film on Blu-ray on April 2, 2013. The Blu-ray includes the Theatrical and Extended cuts as well as all of the bonus features found on the 2-Disc DVD.\n\nSee also [ edit ]'"

Producer and Paramount president Amy Powell said that Yorkey has been giving it some thought.\n\n""We\'re not going to pressure him to create more seasons if he doesn\'t feel they are there, but he is already starting to think about what a season three could be,"" she said.\n\n13 Reasons Why season 2 cast: Will Hannah be back?\n\nDespite showrunner Yorkey playing around with the idea of making 13 Reasons Why an anthology series at one point \xe2\x80\x93 \xc3\xa0 la True Detective \xe2\x80\x93 season two will keep the same cast and the same setting.\n\nMost notably, yes, Katherine Langford will be back as Hannah Baker.\n\nNetflix\n\n""I think one of the things that is still hanging out there is this question of, is someone responsible for Hannah\'s death?""

I would prepare fans not to expect the Hannah from season one for a multitude of reasons.""\n\nWe also can\'t have a second season without Clay Jensen. Actor Dylan Minnette is too, confirming via this pretty cool Instagram snap:\n\nThis content is imported from Instagram. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Dylan Minnette (@dylanminnette)\n\nMinnette shed some light into the second season by saying that the never-before-seen flashbacks with Hannah in the new episodes will cover new ground by featuring other characters rather than himself.\n\nRoss Butler (Zach Dempsey) all but confirmed his return back in April 2017, after he revealed that he dropped out of Riverdale to be part of the second season of 13 Reasons Why.\n\nChristian Navarro (Tony Padilla) tweeted that he was back on set, while Kate Walsh (Olivia Baker) gave an interview revealing the part her character will play in the new episodes.\n\nBrandon Flynn (Justin Foley) said he was excited for season two, posting on Instagram: ""Can\'t wait to get back to work with this beautiful team!"" (Side-note: Flynn will also be seen in True Detective season three on HBO in 2019.)\n\nAlisha Boe (Jessica Davis) and Justin Prentice (Bryce Walker) are back, with Yorkey stating his interest in continuing their stories (more on that later), while Miles Heizer (Alex Standall) suggested his cliffhanger will be addressed \xe2\x80\x93 meaning he will return in some form.\n\nMichele Selene Ang (Courtney Crimsen) said on Instagram: ""See all you freaks back at Liberty High.""\n\nNetflix\n\nDevin Druid (Tyler Down), Amy Hargreaves (Lainie Jensen), Ajiona Alexus (Sherri Holland), Tommy Dorfman (Ryan Shaver), and Timothy Granaderos (Montgomery de la Cruz) all shared the season two teaser video on Twitter and/or Instagram following the show\'s renewal \xe2\x80\x93 which implies that they are all interested in coming back as well.\n\nBrian d\'Arcy James (Hannah Baker\'s father Andy) said in an interview that he would love to return.\n\nAnd could we finally see justice for Jeff? Brandon Larracuente shared in an interview that he would love to play Jeff Atkins again, and suggested that he could feature in flashbacks.\n\n""Considering the entire first season, Jeff was shown entirely in flashbacks, that could be a possibility,"" he said.\n\n@selenagomez Instagram\n\nSelena Gomez didn\'t make a cameo in season one, and fans shouldn\'t expect her to appear in season two, either.\n\nHargreaves commented on the possibility of Selena popping up, saying: ""It would kinda distract from the main story. So I can\'t imagine that she would pop up for a cameo, but who knows? You never know.""\n\nThe show held an open casting call in June, looking for ""students, baseball players, track and field athletes, cheerleaders, boxers, parents, teachers, and coffee shop patrons"". Actors of ""all ages, types, and ethnicities"" were encouraged to attend.\n\nIn August, a few new characters were announced...\n\nKelli O\'Hara, a Tony award-winning Broadway actress and star of Masters of Sex, will join the cast as Jackie, an ""advocate for victims of bullying"" (via TVLine).\n\nThis content is imported from Twitter.

Those cassettes still exist, of course, but rather the episodes will no longer be structured around Hannah\'s narration.\n\nInstead, there will be a ""different sort of analogue technology that plays a hugely important role in season two"", showrunner Yorkey teased. ""The cassette tapes aren\'t at the centre of it \xe2\x80\x93 those two boxes of tapes are still hanging around and matter to people, but there will be a new piece of technology for 13-year-olds to Google and try to understand what it was.""\n\nNetflix\n\nSeason two will keep the multiple-timeline storytelling, but Hannah is no longer the narrator. Instead, somebody else will be providing the voiceover.\n\nWe will see ""other perspectives on Hannah\'s story"", too. This is particularly interesting, because there were a couple of moments in the first season where certain characters questioned Hannah\'s ""truth"".\n\nOf note, remember the letter that Hannah gave to Zach? The one which she claimed he had thrown away, thus rejecting her plea for help?\n\nThe reality is that Zach actually kept the note. Did Hannah lie, or was she just mistaken? Maybe that will be explained.\n\nNetflix\n\n""Hannah told her version of events, but there are at least 12 kids who have another version of those events that we actually haven\'t really heard from yet,"" Yorkey said.\n\nTime-wise, the second season will pick up ""a number of months"" after season one (according to Yorkey), and will in part cover the trial and the Bakers\' lawsuit against the school.\n\nKate Walsh (Hannah\'s mother Olivia Baker) teased: ""We\'ll see more and more of the mystery getting revealed, and I think you see Mrs Baker still questing for the answers of what happened to her daughter.""\n\nYou should also expect a number of other loose ends to be addressed when the show returns. Most of the characters were in a dark place by the end of last season (star Miles Heizer confirmed that the show will not shy away from ""taboo topics"" it tackled in the first season), but could some of them find happiness?\n\n""[The individual cliffhangers are] all related, so I would very much like to explore where they all go and to see if there is, as I think there will be, some light for these kids,"" Yorkey said.\n\nJessica is still trying to recover from her rape, while Bryce \xe2\x80\x93 who raped Jessica and Hannah \xe2\x80\x93 will hopefully be receiving some form of comeuppance, whatever that may be.\n\nNetflix\n\n""I want to do Jessica\'s story the deserved justice of following her as she goes back to school, as she tries to begin to recover from what happened to her, because it\'s something that millions of young women go through,"" Yorkey said.\n\n""And also [I want to] see somebody punch Bryce in the face.""\n\nThe cast seem to be in agreement as well, with stars such as Alisha Boe and Brandon Flynn saying that they hope to see ""justice for Hannah and Jessica"".\n\nTimothy Granaderos similarly wants the people who wronged Hannah to be ""held accountable"".\n\nOther cliffhangers from the season one finale include what happens with school counsellor Kevin Porter (will he be fired?), Alex\'s suicide attempt, Zach desperately trying to reach Alex only to receive a call from somebody else, and Tyler\'s stash of guns.\n\nNetflix\n\nSelena Gomez, pop singer and one of the producers on the show, said that she has been in the writers\' room and that there were story moments she learned which left her ""almost freaking out"".\n\nShe later said that the new season will be ""really encouraging and empowering"".\n\nAny fears that 13 Reasons Why would have to censor itself in light of the controversy the show drew for season one (over its depiction of suicide) can rest easy: Dylan Minnette and executive producer Tom McCarthy have both said season two will not be censored.\n\n""I\'m sure it\'s going to be just as important and dark as last season,"" Minnette said.\n\nThe actor added that the second season\'s theme will be ""recovery"", adding: ""It\'s naturally going to progressively get to a more emotional place, due to the nature of the story we\'re telling. I\'m sure we\'re all heading in some dark directions again.""\n\nAnd new cast member Anne Winters said that the new episodes will be less ""black and white"" compared to season one.\n\n""This season will explore a little of those grey areas... so that when people raise the question of, \'Well, wasn\'t it her fault that she did this or that?\' this season shows a different take on it,"" she shared.\n\n13 Reasons Why season 2 theories: Did Tyler shoot Alex?\n\nWith the way the season one finale ended, it\'s not surprising that people have been coming up with fan theories about season two \xe2\x80\x93 many of which are truly clever and imaginative.\n\nPerhaps the most popular one out there is tied to Alex\'s cliffhanger. In the finale, Alex was fighting for his life after it was revealed that he shot himself.\n\nWe never saw this happen on screen, and fans have suggested that Tyler actually shot him instead. The theory points out that Tyler had a stash of guns hidden in his room, and that he ominously took down Alex\'s photo that he had previously hung up in his studio.\n\nNetflix\n\nHowever, Miles Heizer (who plays Alex) has appeared to dismiss that theory.\n\n""That\'s another subject that\'s very rarely shown on screen and is probably a lot more common than people think it is: people attempting to take their lives and it not happening. I\'m sure that will bring a crazy set of issues. It would be interesting to go into that,"" he said.\n\nThat\'s not all. Alex was seen in an ambulance \xe2\x80\x93 but if you ask some fans, they think that scene is actually a flashforward and it\'s not Alex there at all. Maybe it\'s Bryce. Maybe it\'s Justin.\n\nAs for Tyler\'s stash of guns, one common theory is that he is planning a school shooting.\n\nNetflix\n\nTyler had photos of numerous other students (including Clay) in his studio \xe2\x80\x93 people who have wronged and bullied him. Maybe these students are the targets, and maybe he actually took down Alex\'s picture because he had decided to spare him (the opposite of the \'Tyler shoots Alex\' theory).\n\nLastly, a lot of fans seem to think that Tony is either a ghost or a figment of Clay\'s imagination.\n\nThis one is a little more difficult to swallow (and indeed, Christian Navarro himself has shot that down), mainly because we have seen Tony interacting with plenty of other characters besides Clay, but it\'s interesting nonetheless...\n\nSuicide is preventable.

"b'The Daily Beast\n\nIn a surprise news conference on Thanksgiving Day, President Trump took questions from the press for the first time since losing re-election\xe2\x80\x94but he doubled down on his \xe2\x80\x9crigged\xe2\x80\x9d election claims and appeared to deny the reality that his presidency is ending, saying it will be \xe2\x80\x9cvery hard\xe2\x80\x9d for him to concede to Joe Biden.\xe2\x80\x9cI think it\xe2\x80\x99s not right he\xe2\x80\x99s trying to pick a Cabinet,\xe2\x80\x9d Trump complained after railing against the supposed \xe2\x80\x9cmassive fraud\xe2\x80\x9d that he claims gave Biden victory.Reiterating his claims of voter fraud in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Georgia despite the fact that state authorities have already certified the election results in those states, Trump appeared to become combative when asked if he would concede if the Electoral College votes for Biden on Dec. 14. Although he eventually did say he would exit the White House if the vote were not in his favor, that answer came after he first repeatedly cast doubt on the Electoral College and election in general. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a very hard thing to concede. Because we know there was massive fraud,\xe2\x80\x9d he said when first asked if he would concede. Pennsylvania Certifies Biden as Winner, Driving Stake in Trump\xe2\x80\x99s Legal Effort\xe2\x80\x9cTime isn\xe2\x80\x99t on our side \xe2\x80\xa6 this was a massive fraud, this should never take place in this country, we\xe2\x80\x99re like a third-world country,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, suggesting that faulty vote-counting machines gave Biden millions of extra votes.Asked a second time if he would concede if the Electoral College votes for Biden, Trump responded, \xe2\x80\x9cWell if they do they made a mistake,\xe2\x80\x9d before saying it\xe2\x80\x99s a \xe2\x80\x9cpossibility\xe2\x80\x9d and scolding a reporter who pressed him on the issue: \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t talk to me that way, you\xe2\x80\x99re just a lightweight.\xe2\x80\x9dAsked by another reporter if he would \xe2\x80\x9cleave this building\xe2\x80\x9d if the Electoral College elects Biden, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cCertainly, I will.\xe2\x80\x9dWhile Trump and his legal team have repeatedly looked to throw out votes in states that Joe Biden carried, none of their challenges have proved successful.Key states such as Michigan, Pennsylvania and Georgia\xe2\x80\x94all of which Trump carried in 2016, before flipping blue this year\xe2\x80\x94certified their results this week, ensuring they will send a Democratic slate of voters to the Electoral College. Wisconsin and Arizona, two more states that flipped to Biden, are set to certify their results next week.\xe2\x80\x9cMassive fraud has been found. We\xe2\x80\x99re like a third world country,\xe2\x80\x9d Trump said, before launching back into allegations of voter fraud that have been repeatedly rebuffed in court and by state election officials of both parties.\xe2\x80\x9cI did so well ... that they didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what to do,\xe2\x80\x9d he said at one point of election results in Georgia, claiming that ballots for him were \xe2\x80\x9cthrown away.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what is going to happen. I know one thing, Joe Biden did not get 80 million votes. And I got 74 million but there were many ballots thrown away, so I got much more than that. But I got 74 million, 74 million is 11 million more than I got last time. \xe2\x80\xa6 And it\xe2\x80\x99s millions more than Hillary Clinton got.\xe2\x80\x9dUnderneath all of the bravado, Trump at one point slipped up and blasted \xe2\x80\x9cthe Biden administration,\xe2\x80\x9d apparently inadvertently recognizing Biden\xe2\x80\x99s win.While Trump has refused to concede and maintained that somehow, he would win states he had already lost, his administration has relented behind the scenes.Earlier this week, Emily Murphy, the head of the General Services Administrations\xe2\x80\x94a Trump appointee\xe2\x80\x94signed off on a letter officially allowing the presidential transition to begin. Murphy had previously refused to do so, a partisan move from a historically non-partisan agency.Even Trump appeared to have a moment of clarity Thursday regarding a potential COVID-19 cure and his future (or lack thereof) in the White House.\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t let Joe Biden take credit for the vaccine,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

Joanna confirms on her blog this is completely false.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn summary, don't buy the facial cream, friends,\xe2\x80\x9d she writes.\n\nBut WCPO News in Cincinnati has seen this same scam before. They interviewed a woman named Lisa Zillich who\xe2\x80\x99d seen a similar ad online. Only this ad was for an anti-wrinkle skin cream called Satin Youth, supposedly marketed by Ivanka Trump.\n\nRELATED: Fake church scams people with a dangerous \xe2\x80\x98miracle cure\xe2\x80\x99\n\nLisa payed $3.95 in shipping for a \xe2\x80\x9cfree trial\xe2\x80\x9d of the product, which arrived a few days later. However, after a few weeks, Lisa noticed an additional $99.95 charge to her credit card from the company. When she called to dispute the charge, she was informed that the fine print included in the \xe2\x80\x9cfree trial\xe2\x80\x9d offer stipulated that customers have just 14 days from their order to request a refund. So for Lisa, it was too late.\n\nThe representative insisted Ivanka Trump owned the company. However, a Google search done by WCPO News uncovered online ads for various products boasting Ivanka\xe2\x80\x99s name, just like the newest one featuring Joanna Gaines. Each ad was made to look like an article written by a popular magazine, and all linked to the same $4 trial offer.\n\nSetting The Record Straight\n\nSo, with the scam circulating and so many rumors swirling around, Fixer Upper star Joanna Gaines warned her fans not to be duped. She urged folks to rely on her official social media outlets for any news related to her and her family. Then, she set the record straight once and for all:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd just in case you were wondering, YES! We are currently filming season 5 of the show. No!

It certainly has the cast \xe2\x80\x93 Jamie Foxx, Ansel Elgort, Kevin Spacey, Jon Hamm and more \xe2\x80\x93 to back it up. The movie centers on Baby (Elgort) a getaway driver who meets his dream girl and wants to start a new life.\n\nDon\'t Edit\n\nDespicable Me 3 (June 30)\n\nThe \xe2\x80\x9cDespicable Me\xe2\x80\x9d franchise looks to continue its lucrative winning streak, as Gru takes on a former child star turned adversary as well as his twin brother Dru.\n\nDon\'t Edit\n\nThe House (June 30)\n\nTwo of comedy\xe2\x80\x99s most reliable players join forces when Amy Pohler and Will Ferrell play a couple who starts an underground casino to pay for their daughter\xe2\x80\x99s college tuition.\n\nDon\'t Edit\n\nSpider-Man: Homecoming (July 7)\n\nAll signs point to Tom Holland as the right choice to revive the Spider-Man film franchise. This time around, high school student Peter Parker must come to terms with his powers with help from Iron Man as they battle Vulture (Michael Keaton).\n\nDon\'t Edit\n\nDon\'t Edit\n\nWar of the Planet of the Apes (July 14)\n\nThe latest version of the \xe2\x80\x9cPlanet of the Apes\xe2\x80\x9d franchise has quietly featured some of the most satisfying action films in recent memory. \xe2\x80\x9cWar of the Planet of the Apes\xe2\x80\x9d will move things even further as Caesar leads his apes against an army of humans.\n\nDon\'t Edit\n\nDunkirk (July 21)\n\nChristopher Nolan\xe2\x80\x99s war epic promises to be one of the biggest moves of the year. The acclaimed director tells the story of Allied troops stranded on a beach in France during World War II and the heroics required to barely stay alive.\n\nDon\'t Edit\n\nValerian and the City of Thousand Planets (July 21)\n\nBased on the popular comic book series ""Valerian and Laureline,"" the Luc Besson directed film is set in the 28th century and focused on two operatives looking to keep the peace in a world that visually should blow you mind.\n\nDon\'t Edit\n\nAtomic Blonde (July 28)\n\nCharlize Theron goes into full action mode as a member of Her Majesty\xe2\x80\x99s Secret Intelligence Service with all the skills necessary to (hopefully) survive the most dangerous mission of her career.\n\nDon\'t Edit\n\nThe Emoji Movie (July 28)\n\nIf they can make a movie out of Angry Birds, why not emojis? \xe2\x80\x9cThe Emoji Movie\xe2\x80\x9d dives into the fictional world of the playful faces you use to punctuate your text messages.\n\nDon\'t Edit\n\nDon\'t Edit\n\nAn Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power (July 28)\n\nWith President Donald Trump willing to cut funding for green initiatives, a sequel to Al Gore\xe2\x80\x99s landmark documentary seems appropriate at this time.

"b'The new Southern Charm mom has already made a decision about the possibility of expanding her family.\n\nSome women can\'t wait to be mothers, but Cameran Eubanks wasn\'t exactly one of them. We watched Cameran contemplate whether or not she should start a family with husband Jason Wimberly for a few seasons on Southern Charm.\n\nBut then everything seemed to change last April when Cameran announced that she and Jason were expecting their first child, a girl. Fast-forward to November 11, 2017, and the Southern Charm couple welcomed little Palmer Corrine Wimberly into the world.\n\nNow that Cameran is five months into motherhood and has experienced all of the ups and downs it has to offer, we\'re all dying to know if the Southern Charm mom is now eager to keep on expanding her family. ""No, I will not have more kids in the future,"" Cameran said definitively when The Daily Dish caught up with her in New York on Tuesday. ""My husband and I had a very serious baby talk on our anniversary, and we weighed the pros and we weighed the cons. And I do not think I will be having more children.""\n\nThough the psychic healer at one of Patricia Altschul\'s parties last season of Southern Charm predicted that Cameran would have three children, it sounds like Palmer is all she and her husband need. ""I don\'t think I have the personality for more than one. I think I would have to jump off a bridge,"" Cameran joked. ""No, one is good. With one child, one parent can take [her], the other person can get things done. It\'s my speed.""\n\nCameran didn\'t exactly love the nine months-plus leading up to Palmer\'s birth, either.

I was kind of mortified by the whole thing.""\n\nBut of course, Cameran couldn\'t be happier to have Palmer in her life. ""Yes, I am glad that I went through with it. I love Palmer. It is so true, like the saying, \'When you have a baby, your heart lives outside of your body.\' It is the most love you will ever feel,"" she shared.

"b""We should pause, for a moment, and appreciate the miracles that are the Magic Mike movies. Never has there been a franchise so attuned to women's desires. The second film is, in fact, entirely about finding out what women find sexy and then giving it to them. The number of films made about male desire are numerous and frankly boring. So it's kind of revolutionary to showcase a lot of shirtless men gyrating for women's amusement. Having been to screenings, I can tell you that it's like no other moviegoing experience I've ever had. Women stamped, cheered, and clapped for action happening on-screen. The appetite for these movies is intense. And, look, it's really good dancing. And they're legitimately funny! Great work all around."""

I really don't. I'm not here to show off the way that I used to. It's just not who I am anymore.\xe2\x80\x9d She told DeGeneres that she now understands that the thieves had been tracking her for two years, as they were monitoring and aware of her acquisitions and range of possessions, in part due to her social-media posts.\n\nShe teared up at the end of the segment, too, when describing her thought process during the robbery itself. \xe2\x80\x9cAutomatically, your stomach drops. It's a feeling you just can't describe. I said a prayer. I said I know I'm going to heaven, I hope my kids and my husband are O.K.\xe2\x80\x9d But now, looking back on it, she does believe it could have been more dire. \xe2\x80\x9cIt does happen really fast, it was a good seven or eight minutes of torture, but when I look back and I analyze it, it could have been worse. They weren't really aggressive; it could have been way worse, so I don't want to sound like I'm not grateful. I'm out, I'm home, I'm safe. I'm such a better person.

Kardashian West\xe2\x80\x94who says she hasn\xe2\x80\x99t spoken to Jenner in a few weeks\xe2\x80\x94said she is disappointed in the portrayal.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy heart breaks for my mom, you know, because I feel like she\xe2\x80\x99s been through so much and [Caitlyn is] promoting this book and she\xe2\x80\x99s saying all these things. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s necessary, and I just feel like it\xe2\x80\x99s unfair, things aren\xe2\x80\x99t truthful.\xe2\x80\x9d (The central claim in the book, leveled by Caitlyn, is that Kris was aware Caitlyn identified as a woman before they got married.)\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cKendall and Kylie, that\xe2\x80\x99s their dad, and I think my mom\xe2\x80\x99s been so respectful for so long and always wanting Caitlyn around and always wanting to have a great relationship with Caitlyn,\xe2\x80\x9d Kardashian West said. \xe2\x80\x9cI feel like it\xe2\x80\x99s taken [Jenner] a really long time to be honest with herself, so I don\xe2\x80\x99t expect her to be honest about my mom now. But it\xe2\x80\x99s just so hurtful.

"b'\n\nSome disturbing, but not surprising, news is billowing out from the set of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Real\xe2\x80\x9d like smoke from an extinguished fire.\n\nThe \xe2\x80\x9cfire\xe2\x80\x9d was the firing of popular co-host Tamar Braxton for basically five major reasons, including: On-set tantrums, \xe2\x80\x9cp-ssing off\xe2\x80\x99 sponsors, and a focus group that revealed Tamar\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9caggressive eye-rolling and mouth-smacking\xe2\x80\x9d turned off \xe2\x80\x9ceducated women\xe2\x80\x9d viewers as they are \xe2\x80\x9cindicative of behavior African-American women have worked years to overcome.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nExecutives of \xe2\x80\x98The Real\xe2\x80\x99 reportedly fired Tamar from \xe2\x80\x9cThe Real\xe2\x80\x9d for three real reasons:\n\nNegative feedback on her \xe2\x80\x98ghetto\xe2\x80\x99 persona received from focus groups of the daytime talk show\n\nOn-set insubordination\n\nAdvertiser complaints \xe2\x80\x93 (The show\xe2\x80\x99s sales team made it clear that advertisers did not want her in their segments due to her antics and lack of cooperation).\n\nOn Saturday, May 21, Braxton and her co-hosts (Adrienne Bailon, Jeannie Mai, Loni Love and Tamara Mowry) all got phone calls from the show\xe2\x80\x99s parent company Telepictures/Warner Bros. to inform the group that the popular talk show would be moving forward without Braxton.\n\nBraxton was blindsided by the news, as were all of her co-hosts.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cEveryone was caught off guard. None of them saw it coming and everyone was completely blindsided by the decision,\xe2\x80\x9d a source close to production tells Daily Mail Online.\n\nThe cast was also taken aback because, as Loni Love stated in her video response, all five cast members had just completed a new photo shoot for images that were supposed to be used to promote their upcoming third season.\n\nThe group was also scheduled to fly to New Orleans together over the July 4th weekend for a rare off-season multi-day taping to occur at this year\xe2\x80\x99s Essence Festival, where they were scheduled to film episodes of their show and premiere them when they returned in September.\n\nBut an alleged flagrant Braxton error in judgement derailed that those plans. The show\xe2\x80\x99s executive producer is said to have cursed her out in earshot of other staffers on set a few weeks ago, after Braxton reportedly sulked over losing a game during the taping, the Daily Mail reports.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was an ugly scene. Pinterest was sponsoring the segment and Tamar was genuinely upset she was losing the game.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98She really acted out during the taping in front of the studio audience and then exploded behind the scenes once the show was done.\n\nProducers had to heavily edit the segment to make it presentable to air on TV, but the sponsor was on set for the segment and witnessed it all,\xe2\x80\x9d the source explains. (you can read it in its entirety here).\n\nAccording to production staff, the newspaper continues, Braxton\xe2\x80\x99s outbursts on set were frequent and she regularly blew up at the executive producer and oftentimes her husband, prolific producer Vincent Hubert and/or her co-hosts would have to work to put out the flames.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s just say she was becoming unbearable to work with,\xe2\x80\x9d the source said.\n\nBut the move to finally ax Braxton probably came when she took time off of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Real\xe2\x80\x9d to contend on \xe2\x80\x9cDancing with the Stars\xe2\x80\x9d that producers realized the show could survive without her.\n\nFirst off, there was peace on set and, most importantly, the ratings maintained and at times, went up depending on whom was guest co-hosting the show, the source explained.\n\nAfter Telepictures received a two-year renewal of \xe2\x80\x98The Real\xe2\x80\x99 on all Fox stations and on BET where it re-airs, execs reportedly wanted to see what they could do to make the show better for Seasons 3 and 4.\n\nHere came the focus groups.\n\nThe research from the focus group was also a major factor in the decision to fire Braxton. She did doesn\xe2\x80\x99t score well with educated women, The Daily Mail reports:\n\n\xe2\x80\x98The focus group research showed that most educated and working women did not identify with Tamar\xe2\x80\x99s show vernacular and her use of words known to be popular among drag queens and some gay men \xe2\x80\x93 phrases like \xe2\x80\x9cget your life,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cwhere they do that at,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9chave several seats.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x98It was even said she seemed more suited to be a judge on RuPaul\xe2\x80\x99s Drag Race on Logo instead of a talk show host on The Real,\xe2\x80\x99 revealed the source.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98The research went on to say that most educated and working women found her to be \xe2\x80\x98ghetto\xe2\x80\x99 and that her aggressive eye-rolling, neck-rolling and the smacking of her mouth were indicative of \xe2\x80\x98stereotypical behavior that African American women have worked years to overcome,\xe2\x80\x9d the source continued.\n\nThe Real\xe2\x80\x99s executive producer used the aforementioned reasons (the focus group findings, on-set insubordination and the sales team issues about advertisers not wanting Braxton in their segments) to convince Warner Bros. to give Braxton the boot!\n\nVince Herbert, Braxton\xe2\x80\x99s husband and manager, was kept in the dark about these decision to get rid of his wife.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe knew they were having problems with her and he shielded Tamar from a lot of what was being said and done, but in the end his producer credit on the show was more about vanity and less about control,\xe2\x80\x9d the source revealed.\n\nFor the record, Warner Bros. wanted to work out an exit agreement with Braxton that wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t make viewers aware she was being fired but before they could hammer out a joint statement and an agreement that was good for both parties, Tamar had already posted that cryptic message on IG about betrayal and an unnamed person who she feels \xe2\x80\x98stabbed\xe2\x80\x99 her \xe2\x80\x98in the back.\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s that type of impulsive behavior and lack of self control that is why she is off the show,\xe2\x80\x99 the source said.'"

"b'Grand Central Publishing\n\nCaitlyn Jenner\'s long-in-the-works book has finally arrived, and as you can guess from that title, it is indeed full of secrets \xe2\x80\x94 so many secrets, in fact, that it\'s become a point of contention with Mama Kris on Keeping Up With the Kardashians. There\'s nothing particularly shocking in the book (except for maybe the part where Caitlyn implies she came up with the idea for KUWTK), but it\'s easy to see why Kris might not approve of everything she read. Below, the book\'s 16 biggest reveals.\n\n\n\n1. She felt she didn\xe2\x80\x99t deserve the Arthur Ashe Courage Award. Caitlyn writes that she doesn\'t necessarily feel ""brave"" because she chose to go public with her gender identity issues, despite the fact that her decision is often described that way. ""For me it was a form of cowardice to wait so long,"" she says, adding that she doesn\'t think she deserved the award bestowed on her by the ESPYs back in 2015, ""but nobody would turn down such an honor.""\n\n\n\nThis content is imported from YouTube. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.\n\n2. But wants you to know that it was not a prearranged publicity stunt. Because the ESPYs took place so soon after Caitlyn\'s Diane Sawyer interview and Vanity Fair cover, rumors circulated that she only agreed to do the 20/20 special if she got the award. ""It is 100 percent wrong, complete bullshit,"" Caitlyn writes. ""The actual interview took place months before I was told I would be receiving the Arthur Ashe award.""\n\n3. Caitlyn\xe2\x80\x99s publicist first killed a story about her gender identity in the 1980s. After finding out that the New York Times had been looking ""to pin down a story"" on Caitlyn wearing women\'s clothing, Caitlyn told her publicist Alan Nierob about her feelings and had him kill it. ""He pounds the crap out of the Times,"" Caitlyn writes. ""It works.""\n\n4. She did a screen test for Superman but didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to cut her hair for the role. ""My hair is one of the few ways I can feel my femininity, and it is these tentacles that keep me going, make me feel some tiny piece of my authentic self.""\n\n5. Caitlyn\xe2\x80\x99s relationship with Khlo\xc3\xa9 remains fractured. This much is obvious if you\'ve seen any recent episodes of KUTWK, but according to Caitlyn, her relationship with Khlo\xc3\xa9 has not fully recovered since her transition. ""Khlo\xc3\xa9 has the hardest time with it,"" she says. ""It is something Khlo\xc3\xa9 and I should talk about privately, as we have on many occasions on other sensitive subjects. But we have not, although I have tried. We have not been the same since.""\n\n6. The Kardashians were intentionally left out of the first Diane Sawyer special. If you watched 20/20 and thought it seemed like there wasn\'t very much Kris and the gang, you were right. ""They are right to feel slighted,"" says Caitlyn. ""They were slighted on purpose because of research showing that anytime a Kardashian is on television, many in the public tend to think it is a publicity stunt to make money.""\n\n7. During her marriage to Kris, Kris had total control over Caitlyn\xe2\x80\x99s finances. According to Caitlyn, she did not have a checking account during the peak KUTWK days and her credit card purchases were ""carefully pored over.""\n\n8. Caitlyn really did not like O.J. Simpson. Caitlyn got to know him via Kris\'s friendship with Nicole Brown Simpson and never enjoyed spending time with him: ""He was the most narcissistic, egocentric, neediest asshole in the world of sports I had ever seen, and I had seen a lot of them.""\n\n9. Caitlyn thought O.J. was guilty, and according to Caitlyn, so did Kris and Robert Kardashian. Caitlyn says that she and Kris ""believed he had done it the minute we heard of her murder and the circumstances surrounding it."" As for Kardashian, who died in 2003, Caitlyn claims that he once said while in a car, ""I would\'ve been OK with it if they\'d gotten him in the first trial.""\n\n10. Rumors that Caitlyn regretted transitioning are completely untrue. Ian Halperin, who wrote the unauthorized biography Kardashian Dynasty, claimed in 2016 that Caitlyn regretted her transition. Caitlyn slams these rumors as ""100 percent wrong and garbage and swill.""\n\n11. She may have been the real brains behind the KUTWK operation. In one throwaway line, Caitlyn hints that she\'s actually the person who came up with the idea to film the Kardashian family. ""The house is awash in puberty and adolescence and young adulthood and two parents with very different styles,"" she writes. ""It seems to me something is there for television."" Then, in a new paragraph: ""Kris says she is the one who came up with the idea and decided to actively pitch it to Ryan Seacrest."" Care to weigh in, Ryan?\n\n12. Caitlyn\xe2\x80\x99s family was embarrassed by KUTWK. Caitlyn says her aunt Ellie sent a letter to her and Kris after the show debuted about how Caitlyn had become a ""disappointment"" to her fans. ""The implication is that I have sold myself out, willingly destroyed what positive reputation I have left,"" she writes. ""Pretty much on the mark.""\n\n13. But Caitlyn says her depiction on the show was more or less accurate. ""I come across in the reality show as a well-meaning but slightly doddering patriarch who has no life of his own and is subsumed by the women who surround him and only does what his wife tells him,"" she writes. ""In other words: a totally true depiction.""\n\n14. Burt, Brandon, and Brody Jenner hated Caitlyn\xe2\x80\x99s Vanity Fair cover. Caitlyn says it had less to do with the photograph being ""risqu\xc3\xa9"" and more to do with the fact that she ""did not gauge how a son would feel seeing his father in a cream-colored bustier.""\n\n15. Kim was a little disappointed that Caitlyn spelled her name with a ""C."" Caitlyn\'s recollection of this conversation makes it seem like Kim was joking, but Caitlyn also had this to say about Kim even asking about it: ""Spoken like a true Kardashian.""\n\n16. Caitlyn had gender confirmation surgery, which she calls ""the Final Surgery,"" in January 2017. While this is not something a transgender person ever has an obligation to discuss (and Caitlyn herself reiterates several times that it\'s no one\'s business but the person who\'s having it), Caitlyn says she chose to include it because she wanted to be able to stop talking about it. ""I feel not only wonderful but liberated,"" she writes. ""I am telling you because I believe in candor. So all of you can stop staring. You want to know, so now you know. Which is why this is the first time, and the last time, I will ever speak of it.""\n\nFollow Eliza on Twitter.\n\n\n\nEliza Thompson senior entertainment editor I\xe2\x80\x99m the senior entertainment editor at Cosmopolitan.com, which means my DVR is always 98 percent full.\n\nThis content is created and maintained by a third party, and imported onto this page to help users provide their email addresses.

Spring is all about lighting up your wardrobe, and the Hollywood starlet proves that it starts with bold colors.\n\nThe star matched her vibrant, orange-red T by Alexander Wang Silk & Cotton Crop Bomber with an army-green skirt and some white Reebok Classic Leather sneakers, for a more relaxed but put-together look that doesn't scream prison escape or walking traffic cone. The trick here is to complement the slouchy silhouette of the jacket with a structured piece, like her color-blocked bag.\n\nOn top of adding some pop and edge to your outfit, a cropped bomber is the perfect way to putting on a light layer.

The film is being helmed by James Ponsoldt.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGetting to act with Tom Hanks in any scene is bit of a dream.

( REUTERS )\n\nThe actor was earlier quoted by the International media as saying that she started working on the film with a lot of expectations from Tom Hanks. And it goes without saying how he lived up to all of them. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no way he\xe2\x80\x99s going to be as nice as everyone says he is and whatever else. And then he was! He\xe2\x80\x99s so generous and funny and easy-going and he\xe2\x80\x99s all the things you would want him to be. So I\xe2\x80\x99m very happy to be able to report that to you sincerely because it would have broken my heart, I think, if Tom wasn\xe2\x80\x99t Tom,\xe2\x80\x9d she was quoted by E! News.\n\nIn the film, while Emma Watson essays the role of Mae Holland, the youngest employee of The Circle, Tom Hanks plays Eamon Bailey, who is the founding head of the organisation. The Circle is expected to hit theatres in India on May 19.\n\nTalking about the relationship that their onscreen characters share, the Beauty and the Beast actor adds, \xe2\x80\x9cMae and Bailey, well it starts out as employer employee and it becomes, I would say one of those very complicated, patriarchal relationships where Bailey takes on the kind of father figure sort of role with her but of course is her employer at the end of the day.

"b'When Shawna Craig first met Lorenzo Lamas in 2011, she didn\xe2\x80\x99t think the two would start a romance. For starters, the \xe2\x80\x9cFalcon Crest\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cRenegade\xe2\x80\x9d actor was already involved with someone else.\n\nThe 31-year-old actress and model was first introduced to the 59-year-old through a friend in Los Angeles, who suggested the pair should date.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLorenzo said, \xe2\x80\x98Oh, I would love to, but I have a girlfriend,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Craig told Fox News. \xe2\x80\x9cSo it was kind of an awkward transition. I thought we could be friends.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWHY \'SECOND WIVES CLUB\' SHIVA SAFAI TURNED DOWN \'REAL HOUSEWIVES OF BEVERLY HILLS\'\n\nBut a week after the initial meeting, the two saw each other again \xe2\x80\x94 and this time the actor made a move.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe said, \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99d like to take you out on a date, if that\xe2\x80\x99s OK,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d she recalled. \xe2\x80\x9cI said, \xe2\x80\x98Well, you have a girlfriend and I would never do that.\xe2\x80\x99 Then he said, \xe2\x80\x98I actually broke up with her because it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a serious relationship. I wanted to be honest with you and start things off properly with you. That\xe2\x80\x99s all buttoned up now and I would like to take you out.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd after three months of dating, Lamas proposed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe showed me the ring. And I said, \xe2\x80\x98Oh, no, no, no,\'\xe2\x80\x9d said Craig. \xe2\x80\x9cI mean, it had only been three months\xe2\x80\xa6 [but] we were engaged for a little over a year and then got married in Mexico. It was great.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut marrying the actor wasn\xe2\x80\x99t all glitz and glamour. Lamas, who was previously married four times and has six children, was faced with financial issues.\n\nIn 2015, Lamas told Fox News he didn\xe2\x80\x99t have his former wives sign prenuptial agreements because \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s like you\xe2\x80\x99re almost professing failure at the outset.\xe2\x80\x9d In addition, he grew tired of waiting for a phone call to \xe2\x80\x9cget me on another B-movie,\xe2\x80\x9d prompting him to pursue a new role as a commercial pilot.\n\nStill, Craig insisted Lamas\xe2\x80\x99 past didn\xe2\x80\x99t make her think twice about the marriage.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it didn\xe2\x80\x99t make me question anything because he\xe2\x80\x99s such an honest, good person and my best friend, first and foremost,\xe2\x80\x9d she explained. \xe2\x80\x9c[But] it did bother me. I just felt like he had spent all of his time, energy, and resources on these people who I didn\xe2\x80\x99t really feel had his best interest at heart and didn\xe2\x80\x99t love him as much as I love him unconditionally.\n\n""So it would always make me sad that he struggled with his finances\xe2\x80\xa6 I thought, \xe2\x80\x98I wish our lives had started off easier where we can have fun and enjoy each other\' instead of, from the very beginning, be stressed with all the things that come along with being with Lorenzo. But that\xe2\x80\x99s something I\xe2\x80\x99ve always struggled with. It has gotten better in the last year or so, but\xe2\x80\xa6 I would get very said about it and I cried.

She believed discussing her husband\xe2\x80\x99s finances made them more relatable to audiences.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think the way that was put together, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t really say it exactly the way it came across,\xe2\x80\x9d she admitted. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is definitely an issue because he\xe2\x80\x99s got three kids that are still young and he\xe2\x80\x99s taking care of them\xe2\x80\xa6 but I think a lot of people go through that. Sometimes finances are great, sometimes it\xe2\x80\x99s hard. I think that\xe2\x80\x99s really relatable. There\xe2\x80\x99s no shame in struggling\xe2\x80\xa6 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s just life.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nViewers also learned how Craig willingly took on the role of step-mom despite not wanting children of her own.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was never something Lorenzo said I needed to do,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was a lot for one person to handle, especially a single dad\xe2\x80\xa6 My mom was a single mother and the girls were really young when I came into Lorenzo\xe2\x80\x99s life. I just thought they needed guidance, structure, and stability. I knew I could provide that to them. It made me happy to do that. I\xe2\x80\x99m really proud of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nCraig particularly bonded with 31-year-old Shayne Lamas. When Lamas\xe2\x80\x99 eldest daughter suffered a near-fatal miscarriage in 2014 that resulted in a full hysterectomy, Craig volunteered to become her surrogate.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never wanted to have children of my own. I always knew I wanted to help in some form,\xe2\x80\x9d said Craig. \xe2\x80\x9cI started out as an egg donor and I did that many times. And all the couples were able to have children because of it. I thought, \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to be doing egg donations for much longer, I would love to carry a child.\n\n""I offered my assistance to Shayne and [her husband] Nik. They were hesitant about it. I said, \xe2\x80\x98Take your time and think about it. If this is something you\xe2\x80\x99d like to move forward with, I\xe2\x80\x99m here.\xe2\x80\x99 And so week later, they called me and said, \xe2\x80\x98Let\xe2\x80\x99s do it, we\xe2\x80\x99re on board.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe couple welcomed their second child together on July 4, 2015. Craig enjoyed every moment of carrying the baby boy named Lyon.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHonestly, if I could be pregnant my whole life, I would,\xe2\x80\x9d she gushed. \xe2\x80\x9cI love being pregnant, it\xe2\x80\x99s so much fun. I know that sounds crazy, but I love it. Shayne is so happy and feels very fulfilled on having a little boy and girl. She\xe2\x80\x99s definitely got her hands full.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nStill, Craig stressed she and her husband have zero plans to have children of their own.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe actually thought about in vitro for about a week,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I was like, \xe2\x80\x98No, I can\xe2\x80\x99t do it.\xe2\x80\x99 He was kind of upset about it, but he looks back and goes, \xe2\x80\x98Thank you so much. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to get a little bit of my life to do my own thing. And if we had kids, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I\xe2\x80\x99d been raising kids my whole life.\xe2\x80\x99 It\xe2\x80\x99s definitely not something I see for myself. Being a surrogate?

His dad demanded that he be delivered as scheduled,\xe2\x80\x9d she recalls. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s one thing to be called a negligent parent, but I will not be one.\xe2\x80\x9d (In July, Maguire filed for sole custody of Harper, claiming Curtis was \xe2\x80\x9cnot a fit\xe2\x80\x9d mother, but later dropped the request.)\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t express in words what it feels like looking at your sick baby and being told that a \xe2\x80\x98parenting time\xe2\x80\x99 schedule trumps their wellbeing. I woke up Thanksgiving morning and thanked God that I was able to have that time with him,\xe2\x80\x9d she continues. \xe2\x80\x9cI arrived at the airport and literally had my baby ripped out of my arms and whisked away as I was \xe2\x80\x98screwing up\xe2\x80\x99 Thanksgiving plans. The cycle never ends.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nImage zoom\n\nStill, Curtis sees one positive opportunity to come out of her situation: sharing her struggles with other parents, and telling them there\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cno shame\xe2\x80\x9d in it.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOver the past ten years [since Rehab Addict\xe2\x80\x99s debut], I have heard from hundreds of \xe2\x80\x98single\xe2\x80\x99 parents. They shared their stories and applauded seeing Ethan\xe2\x80\x99s dad and me in photos, from everything from soccer games to Christmas dinner,\xe2\x80\x9d she tells PEOPLE referring her older son, now in his twenties. \xe2\x80\x9cI encouraged each one to keep trying because it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t always that way and it took a lot of work.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSpeaking of her Instagram post, she explains, \xe2\x80\x9cI wrote my post because it\xe2\x80\x99s something that most people will luckily never understand, but those that do feel shame and just sadness. I am surrounded by AMAZING people and I still have to shake myself loose from the negativity and carry on and it\xe2\x80\x99s a struggle \xe2\x80\x94 I think of those parents that don\xe2\x80\x99t have that. And I have to think about them because they write me, sad and losing hope and the will to keep fighting for their children. Children deserve better.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIn her 2016 memoir Better than New, Curtis describes Maguire\xe2\x80\x99s reaction to her pregnancy as unexpected and writes that she planned to move forward raising the child on her own. (Maguire\xe2\x80\x99s lawyer told PEOPLE in 2016 that his client \xe2\x80\x9ccouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been happier to find out he was the father to his son.\xe2\x80\x9d)\n\nImage zoom Credit: Nicole Curtis/Instagram\n\nMaguire filed for paternity and joint custody in December 2015. He was awarded both, according to The Detroit News.\n\nCurtis and Maguire\xe2\x80\x99s relationship had seemed to take a positive turn in March of 2018, when they had dinner together. \xe2\x80\x9cShane has been to L.A. and the new house,\xe2\x80\x9d Curtis told PEOPLE. \xe2\x80\x9cWe went to dinner the other night just the two of us.\xe2\x80\x9d But things quickly dissolved again when Curtis alleges, she was denied time with Harper on Easter."""

You have two job offers. One pays more, but the other is secure and steady. Which do you choose?\n\n\n\nDefinitely the lucrative job; steady work sounds like drudgery.\n\nProbably the lucrative job, although I\'d look into the secure job.\n\nThe secure job, unless the other job was outrageously lucrative.\n\nDefinitely the secure job, because I plan for the long term.\n\n\n\n35. What\'s the best path to wealth?\n\n\n\nIt\'s a matter of luck and being in the right place at the right time.\n\nStaying flexible so you can take advantage of good opportunities.\n\nFollowing a long-term plan that incorporates a comfortable level of risk.\n\nHard work and perseverance.\n\n\n\n36. If you accepted a job or contract, would you try to finish the task even if it got much more dangerous?\n\n\n\nYes, my word is my bond.\n\nYes, because it\'s good to have a reputation for dependability.\n\nYou can bet I\'d be renegotiating.\n\nIf it\'s no longer a good deal, then the deal is off.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore clicking, make sure JavaScript is enabled, and that all pop-up window-managers are disabled!\n\n\n\n'"

"b'Former \xe2\x80\x9cThe Bachelor\xe2\x80\x9d star Chris Soules \xe2\x80\x9cacted reasonably\xe2\x80\x9d after he rear-ended a fellow Iowa farmer by calling 911 and trying to resuscitate the man, his new legal team said Thursday.\n\nSoules is charged with leaving the scene of a deadly accident, a felony that carries up to five years in prison, in Monday night\xe2\x80\x99s crash near his farm in northern Iowa that killed 66-year-old Kenneth Mosher.\n\nAuthorities say that Soules\xe2\x80\x99 truck rear-ended Mosher\xe2\x80\x99s tractor, throwing him into a ditch. Police audio shows that Soules called 911 to report that he had \xe2\x80\x9crear-ended a guy on a tractor\xe2\x80\x9d and sought medical help for Mosher before he left the scene in another vehicle.\n\nAuthorities say that Soules was located at his home about 10 miles away but that he initially refused to answer his door for officers. He was arrested five hours after the crash after they obtained a warrant to enter the home. Soules was released on bond Tuesday after 10 hours in jail.\n\nInvestigators are looking into who drove Soules away and whether alcohol, speed or texting played a role in the crash. The sheriff says alcoholic beverages were found at the scene and police are trying to determine who had possessed them.\n\nSoules had been represented by attorney Molly Spellman at his initial court appearance Tuesday. But on Thursday, high-profile Iowa defense lawyer Alfredo Parrish and two colleagues from his Des Moines law firm informed the court that they are now representing Soules in the case.\n\nA statement issued Thursday from the firm and Soules\xe2\x80\x99 publicist argued audio of the 911 call showed that initial portrayals of Soules having fled the scene were misleading.\n\nThe statement noted that Soules identified himself on the call and \xe2\x80\x9cexplained his role in the terrible accident.\xe2\x80\x9d It added that he tried to perform CPR on the victim and stayed until emergency medical personnel arrived \xe2\x80\x94 two facts that aren\xe2\x80\x99t clear on the call.\n\nThe call featured someone performing CPR but it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t clear that it was Soules, who told the dispatcher that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t know the technique. The call was abruptly ended by Soules, who police say then \xe2\x80\x9ctook off\xe2\x80\x9d in a truck.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis attorneys are confident that once all the evidence is made public, it will show Soules acted reasonably and did everything in his power to provide aid to Mr. Mosher,\xe2\x80\x9d the statement said, adding that everyone \xe2\x80\x9cin this close-knit farming community is mourning Mr. Mosher\xe2\x80\x99s passing.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSoules, who is required to wear an ankle bracelet for monitoring, is due in court next week for a preliminary hearing.'"
"b'This is beginning to look like the year of Selena Gomez. The musician and actress has been revealed as the host for the 2017 WE Day, the annual one-day California event that brings together thousands of young people in promotion of youth advocacy for social issues.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy first WE Day experience was three years ago and to say I was impressed is an understatement,\xe2\x80\x9d Gomez, 24, said in a statement. She was one of the performers at last year\xe2\x80\x99s event. \xe2\x80\x9cThe electricity of an arena full of thousands of young people who are making real change in the world is like nothing I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever experienced. I am grateful to be a part of such a supportive community and hope I can inspire the kids at WE Day just as they continue to inspire me.\xe2\x80\x9c\n\nShe will be joined by Alicia Keys, who will perform. Other VIP appearances are expected to include Demi Lovato, Bryan Cranston, Lily Collins, Magic Johnson, DJ Khaled, Miss Piggy and Alessia Cara. Lovato was also in attendance last year, as were Charlize Theron and Joe Jonas.\n\nGomez has been making a calculated return to the spotlight since releasing her \xe2\x80\x9ccomeback\xe2\x80\x9d record, \xe2\x80\x9cRevival,\xe2\x80\x9d in October 2015.

He has written and worked on some of the most iconic songs of all time, from Whitney Houston classics to A Whole New World in Disney\xe2\x80\x99s Aladdin.\n\nHe also produced Titanic\xe2\x80\x99s song My Heart Will Go On and wrote Mariah Carey\xe2\x80\x99s Hero.\n\nKatie is truly a small town girl, originally from Elmira, New York.

That scenario and the whole \xe2\x80\x9coff the charts\xe2\x80\x9d vibe caught the eye of mega-producer SallyAnn Salsano (Jersey Shore) who created a TV series Nail Files with Katie as the star.\n\nBut her path to being a successful business owner was hard, and Katie noted on the new E! series how she lived out of her car early on as she made her way in Los Angeles.\n\nThe road to doing nails and creating her own line of nail products was made possible through proper cosmetic nail school and following her imaginative take on this fun and lucrative beauty discipline.\n\nThe Painted Nail sits right outside the W Hotel and will be used in the series as a set while the Second Wives Club cast gets buffed and dishes on other cast members not present.\n\nAll through it, we see Katie act as a Swiss mediator and referee with a wicked sense of humor.\n\nIn past interviews, Katie has mentioned that she really loves fast food chain Taco Bell and we saw this as she took one of the affluent wives, Veronika (formerly married to plastic surgeon Dr. Michael Obeng), to the drive-through for tacos.\n\nEven though she loves \xe2\x80\x9cthe Bell\xe2\x80\x9d, Katie can go high-brow too with food and has a new place to visit in Los Angeles: Hi SocieTEA, which she describes as a \xe2\x80\x9cmini tea bar serving gourmet loose leaf teas, artisan sandwiches and \xe2\x80\x98Hi Tea\xe2\x80\x99 with a twist.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nA total fashionista, Katie has described her look in previous interviews as a \xe2\x80\x9cbit butch\xe2\x80\x9d and has a knack for pairing inexpensive clothes with high-end accessories like shoes and handbags.\n\nHer complete off-script realness and sense of humor and her willingness to work hard daily to make everyone feel more beautiful makes her one of our favorite reality stars, period.\n\nSecond Wives Club airs Thursdays at 9/8c on E!'"
"b'Welcome to Taurus Season, the time in the zodiac calendar when we connect with the earth beneath our feet. Taurus is the fertility of life, the soil the grows the food we eat, the stability that comes with having resources like money and a roof over our head. Taurus is also the pleasure and sensuality that comes with living.\n\nThis Taurus Season, however, will bring a bit of a jolt. Starting May 15 the planet Uranus, after seven years in Aries, will arrive in Taurus, awakening of consciousness to element earth. Uranus in Taurus will be a revolution of value and ownership, a transformation of our relationship with food and money. On its most fundamental level, Uranus in Taurus will give us a radical new understanding of our planet and the fragile balance that everyone and everyone takes for granted.\n\nMars will also change signs on May 15, adding fuel to an already supercharged day. Moving into Aquarius, a sign that it will be in until August, action will now happen on a collective level. Social causes, politics, and activism will all be hot button issues. On a personal level, Mars in Aquarius will inspire us to form community and make friendships or social connection a priority. Mars\xe2\x80\x99s square off with Uranus on May 16, however, may bring a jolt to this new Uranus in Taurus era.\n\nEven though the movements of Uranus and Mars dominate the headlines for May, there are other things going on, namely a Taurus New Moon on May 15. Money, stability, and material needs are at the forefront for the coming lunar month. Additionally, with the energy of the new moon pointing to Venus in Gemini, the coming four weeks will be busy, chatty, and filled with movement.\n\nMercury finally switches signs, too. After two months in Aries, Mercury arrives in Taurus on May 13. Taurus is a slow and chill placement for the usually quick and agile Mercury, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll be acutely aware of the value of our choices. Communication will be practical and down to earth.\n\nVenus also changes sign, moving into Cancer on May 19. We\xe2\x80\x99ll see a shift in Taurus Season after this point too, moving from the restless curiosity of Gemini to the heart and emotional connection of Cancer. Whatever is shaking up with Uranus in Taurus may now have an emotional component. And seeing how Venus will start to face off with Saturn, we may have a serious decision to make around May 26.\n\nWe end the month with a Sagittarius Full Moon, one that will highlight themes we were working on during Saturn\xe2\x80\x99s visit to Sagittarius from 2015 to 2017. Themes like faith, meaning, integrity, right and wrong. Full moons bring matters to a head, but whatever does come about may touch on the spiritual and intuitive with Jupiter harmonizing with compassionate Neptune. Maybe everything is going to work out after all.\n\nRead for your Sun and rising sign.\n\nDATES TO NOTE: 5/6 Sun sextile Neptune; 5/7 Mercury square Pluto, Venus square Neptune; 5/8 Sun opposite Jupiter; 5/11 Sun trine Pluto; 5/12 Mercury square Mars; 5/13 Mercury in Taurus, Mercury conjunct Uranus; 5/15 New Moon 24 Taurus, Uranus in Taurus, Mars in Aquarius; 5/16 Mars square Uranus; 5/18 Mercury trine Saturn; 5/19 Venus in Cancer, Venus sextile Uranus; 5/20 Sun in Gemini, Mars sextile Chiron, Venus square Chiron; 5/22 Mercury sextile Neptune; 5/23 Mercury opposite Jupiter, Sun trine Mars; 5/25 Jupiter trine Neptune, Mercury trine Pluto; 5/26 Venus opposite Saturn; 5/29 Full Moon 8 Sagittarius, Mercury in Gemini.\n\nAries\n\nMarch 21\xe2\x80\x93April 19\n\nAries, did you read your horoscope last month? We had a bit of a chat \xe2\x80\x94 a chat about the last seven years and how your life has been in a major state of ups and downs since then. If astrology teaches us about time and our relationship with time, then the planets are like hands on the clock that move into different signs or different hours. In 2011, the planet Uranus moved into the sign of Aries for a seven year stay, pointing you to a new hour \xe2\x80\x94 a time of revolution, evolution, breakthrough, and awakening. Now at the end of this story, it\xe2\x80\x99s time to reflect a bit on what\xe2\x80\x99s changed and how you have transformed as a person. You\xe2\x80\x99re the sign of bravery, Aries, so hopefully your courage has seen you through the many times you\xe2\x80\x99ve had to reinvent yourself. This month will straddle two chapters, one where you\xe2\x80\x99re seeing the end of this part of your life and another where you\xe2\x80\x99re stepping into a new story. That\xe2\x80\x99s when Uranus arrives in Taurus on May 15. With the hand of the clock pointing to a new hour, it\xe2\x80\x99s time to evolve your consciousness around the material side of life. As the first earth sign, Taurus teaches us about the physical world, from the money and resources we need to survive to food, pleasure, and fertility. Uranus will be shaking up what you you value. It will be demanding new authenticity around what you own and how you make your money. It will be revolutionizing your awareness around what you need. It will push you to look at your self worth as well as the worth of everything around you . . . for the next seven years. Coincidentally, also on May 15, Mars will change signs. As your ruling planet, it\xe2\x80\x99s arrival in Aquarius will point you towards friends, community, and your hopes and wishes for the future. When Mars changes signs, it will square off with Uranus. You may feel quite restless in the run up to May 15, as if something has to radically change. If Mars\xe2\x80\x99s time in Capricorn during March and April has been any indication, you\xe2\x80\x99ve been working hard, trying to make something of yourself, and thinking about what direction you want to go in life. Maybe May is the month where you really put your ideas and ambitions into motion. (Not that Mars will go retrograde from June 26 until August 27 so whatever new beginnings you\xe2\x80\x99re thinking about may take some time to unfold as you pull back and rework things during the middle of 2018.) Want to learn more about how the astrology of May will affect you? Book your consultation now.\n\nKey Themes: Transformation, breakthrough, change, money, income, value, worth, material needs, material life, stability, security, what you own, assets, self worth, fertility, career, public life, reputation, status, responsibilities, ambitions, recognition, friendships, social network, social circle, community, belonging, the future, hopes, dreams, social issues, humanitarian work, the collective, politics.\n\nTaurus\n\nApril 20\xe2\x80\x93May 20\n\nHold onto your horns, Taurus. You\xe2\x80\x99re starting a new seven year story, one that will mark your life with change, transformation, and revolution. You know, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been talking about this for a few months now, how you were coming up to a big shift. And I get it, Taurus. You\xe2\x80\x99re a sign that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like to shake things up. You like things calm and predictable because, as an earth sign, you create the energy of stability. But here comes the planet Uranus, arriving in Taurus on May 15, and jolting your whole world. It\xe2\x80\x99s quite possible that you\xe2\x80\x99ve been feeling this coming, this restless feeling that something has to change. Like the mythical Prometheus, Uranus brings the fire of consciousness. You will have new sight on your life as well as yourself. And with new awareness comes the realization of what\xe2\x80\x99s working and not working in your life. It\xe2\x80\x99s safe to say that over the coming seven years \xe2\x80\x94 yes, seven \xe2\x80\x94 you\xe2\x80\x99re going to reinvent yourself. Maybe it starts with a change of hairstyle or clothes, but by the end it will almost be on a cellular level. Uranus demands authenticity, it demands truth, and it demands a break from the past. So, my dear Taurus, whatever is inauthentic, whatever is not in the truth of who you are, and whatever it is from the past that is holding you back will need to go. Yep, it\xe2\x80\x99s time for change, Taurus. With Uranus dominating the headlines this month, it\xe2\x80\x99s easy to forget that it\xe2\x80\x99s your birthday season. (Sorry, how could I forget???) And you\xe2\x80\x99re getting quite the cosmic gift. It\xe2\x80\x99s important to spend some time reflecting on what you want to create in your coming personal year, especially since the energy is fertile for powerful transformation. On the same day that Uranus changes signs, Mars will also change signs, bringing the energies of change also to your relationships. If you\xe2\x80\x99re in a partnership, you may see a shift, a change of seasons, the arrival of a new chapter, or possibly even a break. If you\xe2\x80\x99re single but wanting to connect with a mate, all these celestial gear shifts may awaken you to a new awareness of the type of partner you want versus what you\xe2\x80\x99ve been reaching for in the past. On May 19, your ruling planet, Venues, will arrive in Cancer, helping you to express your sensitive and caring side into the rest of the month. And since Cancer is one of your travel signs, you may round out the month on the go or planning a trip. By the end of May, a full moon will strike at the heart of your emotions. With everything in flux, you have have to do some soul searching, taking a deep look at your shadow self as well as how you sabotage and hold yourself back. As I mentioned, Uranus will be shining a light on everything, including the deepest parts of yourself. Want to learn more about how the astrology of May will affect you? Book your consultation now.\n\nKey Themes: You, the self, individuality, new beginnings, radical change, transformation, breakdowns, breakthroughs, awakening, new consciousness, new thought, new vision, earthquakes, shake ups, shocks, new you, reinvention, revolution, money, value, stability, security, material possessions, what you own, what you need, relationships, other people, partnerships, career, direction, responsibilities, life direction.\n\nGemini\n\nMay 21\xe2\x80\x93June 20\n\nGemini, if you\xe2\x80\x99ve been paying attention, you\xe2\x80\x99ll know that we\xe2\x80\x99re coming up on a big deal planetary shift on May 15, the day that Uranus, after seven years in Aries, changes signs and enters Taurus. Now, this change will likely be more subtle compared to what other signs are experiencing, but it will shake up a particular part of your chart, bringing Uranus\xe2\x80\x99s patented energy of awakening and transformation to your spiritual life. Let\xe2\x80\x99s unpack that for a moment. As a Gemini, you\xe2\x80\x99re the sign of communication, but you\xe2\x80\x99re also the sign of curiosity and information. While you like to explore, it safe to say that you don\xe2\x80\x99t know everything and that there\xe2\x80\x99s this unknown world out there that can\xe2\x80\x99t be touched \xe2\x80\x94 it can only be sensed. Uranus in Taurus will spark a seven year journey of shedding light on the invisible, the spiritual, the mystical. It\xe2\x80\x99s a time to go behind the scenes and delve into the unconscious and the hidden. Your dreams may be more vivid. You may be seeking out new spiritual paths or new ways to find answers to existential questions, too. Don\xe2\x80\x99t forget, it\xe2\x80\x99s Taurus Season this month, a time in your personal calendar when you\xe2\x80\x99re already pulling back and reflecting, preparing for your new personal year. It\xe2\x80\x99s a good time to meditate as well, being open to insights and downloads from the beyond. Also on May 15, Mars will changed signs, moving into your travel and education sign of Aquarius. Later this month you may be setting out a trip to a far flung destination or looking putting a focus on higher education such as university or anything that deepens your understanding of the world. But, paired with Uranus\xe2\x80\x99s change of signs, it\xe2\x80\x99s also a time when you\xe2\x80\x99re having to question a lot \xe2\x80\x94 both how you express your truth and faith in the world as well as how you find answers to life\xe2\x80\x99s deepest mysteries. And your view of yourself and the world may need to be rocked a little in order for you to move forward. By the end of the month, a full moon will light up your relationship sign of Sagittarius on May 29, highlighting partnership and connection into June. You may need to make a decision about a relationship then or you may find that it\xe2\x80\x99s easier to meet someone if you\xe2\x80\x99re looking for a partner. The same day, Mercury will finally arrive in Gemini, giving you a bit of a boost after a rather long and soulful May \xe2\x80\x94 just in time for your birthday.

Has your life gone in a different direction? Have you professionally reinvented yourself? It\xe2\x80\x99s quite possible that your life is quite different than it was in 2011 \xe2\x80\x94 like, radically different. One of the main culprits has been Uranus. It\xe2\x80\x99s been stirring up your career sign of Aries over the last seven years and you\xe2\x80\x99ve had to completely breakthrough into a new way of being in the world. That said, Uranus is poised to leave and it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to believe that you finally made it. (Yes, it was touch and go at times.) So, what\xe2\x80\x99s next? With Uranus saying goodbye to Aries on May 15, it set its sights on shaking up your sense of community and social connection. If you look at the other signs, Uranus\xe2\x80\x99s change doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have some of the same level of disruption. Instead, the planet of revolution and awakenings is helping you to gain a larger view of your life. Think of the next seven years as connecting you with higher vision and awareness. You may be seeing things from a different perspective. And, as your sense of community and social connection change, you may find your friendships transforming over the coming years. You may seek out radically different groups of people. You may feel a powerful need to find your real tribe or the people that truly understand you. You may feel called to align yourself with social, political, or humanitarian causes. That said, May is Taurus Season, the time in your personal calendar when you are already thinking about community and friendships. You\xe2\x80\x99re also in the last leg of a personal year, and this is a month to think about the future and the sort of things you want to create for yourself. Additionally, Mars will change signs on May 15, proving that the middle of this month is going to be a bit of a jolt. And this placement of Mars may be a bit emotionally prickly. It will also activate themes around trust, intimacy, power, and control. The rest of May will be a time to face your fears as well as look at issues around sexuality and identity. You may also be looking at themes around finance and assets, especially anything you share monetarily with a partner. By the end of May, a full moon will light up your chart\xe2\x80\x99s sector of health and wellness, which is always a good time to revisit fitness goals as well as how you take care of your body. You may even think of it as a mid-year check in on your New Year\xe2\x80\x99s resolutions. Want to learn more about how the astrology of May will affect you? Book your consultation now.\n\nKey Themes: Friendships, social circle, community, groups, the future, hopes, wishes, humanity, social causes, the collective, activism, belonging, intimacy, vulnerability, deep emotions, deep self, sexuality, facing fears, the psyche, rebirth, secrets, money, finance, assets, shared resources, your partner\xe2\x80\x99s money, wealth, debt, estate, health, wellness, diet, fitness, nutrition, organization, daily life, schedule, work, how you take care of your body.\n\nLeo\n\nJuly 23\xe2\x80\x93August 22\n\nLeo, again, like last month, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a lot to talk about. Let\xe2\x80\x99s just say that it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been a quiet time for you, what with the eclipses bouncing back and forth between Leo and your opposing sign of Aquarius. You\xe2\x80\x99re at a crossroads and it\xe2\x80\x99s safe to say that some things have changed in your life. So, here comes another one of those months. You know, the one that keeps you on your toes. May 15 is a big day because it contains within it three major astrological events. One, Uranus changes signs and brings its energy of revolution and transformation to your career sign of Taurus. Two, Mars changes signs, heating of your relationship sign of Aquarius. Then there\xe2\x80\x99s a new moon, which almost seems like an afterthought. Let\xe2\x80\x99s start with Uranus. As I mentioned, it\xe2\x80\x99s the planet of revolution and transformation. The question for you is, are you ready for a career change or professional reinvention? Are you ready to take your life in a new direction? Uranus demands authenticity and if your public life doesn\xe2\x80\x99t match your values, then you may find yourself feeling quite restless in the coming months. It\xe2\x80\x99s quite possible that you\xe2\x80\x99re already feeling this \xe2\x80\x94 this sense that something has to change. Maybe some crazy ideas are percolating, too. Don\xe2\x80\x99t discount them as Uranus has a habit of inspiring a one-eighty. Okay? Then there\xe2\x80\x99s Mars. When it changes signs on May 15, it will activate your relationship sign, which means that, in addition to your career and status, your relationships are getting a lot of action this month. Mars isn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly the softest of influences and if you are in a relationship that has stress in it or prone to arguments, just be aware that Mars will provoke, especially since it\xe2\x80\x99s squaring off of Uranus into May 16. You may feel very emotionally triggered, too, and restless to make a change. Further, the new moon merely underscores the fact that you\xe2\x80\x99re entering a new chapter in life, one that may take you in a very different direction. (I\xe2\x80\x99m reminded of Dorothy getting whisked away to Oz.) This is a lot of astro juju for one day, so just make sure you\xe2\x80\x99re taking care of yourself and making sure you\xe2\x80\x99re in your body. If fact, Saturn\xe2\x80\x99s in the health and wellness part of your chart for the next couple of years, so Saturn is teaching you how to better handle stress and change \xe2\x80\x94 diet, exercise, and having a daily schedule or daily rituals to ground yourself in. As the month progresses, keep an eye on Venus\xe2\x80\x99s change of signs on May 19. It may give you further insight to how these big changes are manifesting.

We have to self reflect, digging into the darker parts of ourselves. It\xe2\x80\x99s the alchemical recipe for personal transformation. With Mercury, your ruling sign, spending an extended time amount of time in Aries \xe2\x80\x94 plus last month\xe2\x80\x99s retrograde \xe2\x80\x94 you\xe2\x80\x99ve done just that. The last couple of months have likely brought a lot of personal reflection on such topics as intimacy, vulnerability, and power as well as facing the parts of ourselves that we don\xe2\x80\x99t want to face. In fact, it\xe2\x80\x99s probably worth mentioning that you\xe2\x80\x99ve had seven years to do this since Uranus was a long term fixture in Aries. If you think back on it, haven\xe2\x80\x99t you had seven years of intense emotional and psychic struggle? The good news is that Uranus will move out of Aries on May 15, but when it arrives in Taurus you\xe2\x80\x99ll begin a new seven year story of transforming what you believe in and how you see the world. Being an earth sign, you can get a little stuck at times. And Uranus will be shaking up your view of yourself and all those engrained limiting beliefs that you\xe2\x80\x99ve been hoarding onto forever. The best of Uranus in Taurus will be an opportunity to fling open the doors of life and get out into the world through travel and exploration. It will be a search for truth and meaning. It will be a time of expressing wisdom after learning some tough life lessons. Uranus will be like a lightning bolt to your mind, opening your awareness of yourself and the world. But \xe2\x80\x94 and it\xe2\x80\x99s a big but \xe2\x80\x94 you have to get out of your way. I love you, Virgo, but you can often get in the weeds with the details and anxiety that everything isn\xe2\x80\x99t perfect. The day that Uranus changes signs is also the same day as a Taurus New Moon, which is merely underscoring that May is kicking off some powerful new beginnings. Also on the same day (May 15 is really packing it in), Mars changes signs, turning up the heat on how you take care of yourself as well as health and work. I think that, with everything going on, it\xe2\x80\x99s a time for you to do what you do well as a Virgo \xe2\x80\x94 get clean, so to speak. There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of stuff you\xe2\x80\x99re holding onto to and some of it\xe2\x80\x99s emotional. So \xe2\x80\x94 and this is just a suggestion \xe2\x80\x94 you may want to use the second half of the month to clean out and organize, getting rid of things from the past and the stuff that really doesn\xe2\x80\x99t match who you are anymore. Maybe even try therapy if that\xe2\x80\x99s not something you\xe2\x80\x99ve considered before. Maybe go on a vision quest because the cosmos is really asking that you find your truth right now. And, by the full moon on May 29, you\xe2\x80\x99ll really be getting to the emotional core of things. Want to learn more about how the astrology of May will affect you?

If we look for your ruling planet, Venus, it\xe2\x80\x99s up in Gemini, putting a personal emphasis this month on travel, exploration, and education. It\xe2\x80\x99s a flirty sign for your Venus to be in, one that likes to socialize, charm, and schmooze. And it\xe2\x80\x99s a time when you need to pay closer attention to your choices and how they manifest. No big deal, right? You\xe2\x80\x99re a sign that generally likes to play it breezy, anyway. So let\xe2\x80\x99s not gloss over the fact that not only is it Taurus Season, a sign that touches on deeper emotions and experiences, but that you\xe2\x80\x99ve got some major planetary shifts on the horizon, one designed to get you to delve into your psyche, your fears, your vulnerability. Sometimes you like to maintain a facade that everything is okay. But what\xe2\x80\x99s bubbling beneath the surface? What don\xe2\x80\x99t you want to look at? Or that you only acknowledge in private? It\xe2\x80\x99s important to mention that on May 15 the planet Uranus will change signs after spending seven years in Aries. If you\xe2\x80\x99re in the astrological know, then you\xe2\x80\x99ll realize that Aries is your relationship sign and that Uranus is an agent of change, transformation, and awakening. Think back seven years ago, say around 2010\xe2\x80\x932011. How have your relationships changed? And I don\xe2\x80\x99t just mean your romantic ones. This includes the quality of connection you forge with other people. If you did your work \xe2\x80\x94 or if Uranus did its work \xe2\x80\x94 there has been a revolution in your relationships with other people over the last seven years. Something is likely fundamentally different. So, as you get closer to May 15, you may be reflecting on what\xe2\x80\x99s changed and how your consciousness around relationships has evolved. (Keep an eye out for the cosmic report card.) And when Uranus changes signs, you\xe2\x80\x99ll be entering a new seven year chapter of awakening your deeper emotions. Remember when I said that Libra has a tendency to gloss over anything that\xe2\x80\x99s imperfect or emotionally messy? This is a time to delve into your capital S Stuff. This is a time for you to stop pretending that everything is fine. This is a time for you to start pulling apart your psyche, examining your emotions as well as your fears and your deeper self. And this new era may start with a bang as Mars will also change signs on May 15, heating up themes around identity, self expression, and creativity. Who are you on a core level? When you strip all the BS away? Hopefully you\xe2\x80\x99re not too shook, Libra. That\xe2\x80\x99s why I wanted to start light and work our way down. (We\xe2\x80\x99re still friends, right?) Then again you\xe2\x80\x99re already feeling this era. Ever since Saturn moved in with you in December, you\xe2\x80\x99ve been in Get Real mode. Meaning, it\xe2\x80\x99s time to get your life in order \xe2\x80\xa6 and this includes your emotional and your financial life as well.

What\xe2\x80\x99s up? How you feeling? Like your whole world is going to turn upside down? No, of course not, Scorpio. You\xe2\x80\x99re in control. You\xe2\x80\x99re always in control. Why are your knuckles white? (Is this a conversation with myself?) Let\xe2\x80\x99s be real Scorpio because you don\xe2\x80\x99t like it any other way. This is a big month for you, one that kicks off a new seven year story around reinvention and transformation \xe2\x80\x94 your favorite! That\xe2\x80\x99s the irony about Scorpio, though. For a sign so much about transformation, it really doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like change. Or it only likes change on its own terms. But, as you know, change is inevitable, and starting May 15, your change will be centered on your relationships, from your romantic partnerships to how you interact and open up to everyone in your life. A revolution is coming and, because you\xe2\x80\x99re such a prescient sign, it\xe2\x80\x99s likely you\xe2\x80\x99ve been feeling this coming for the past couple of months, like the distant rumble of thunder. Uranus is not only going to change your world, it\xe2\x80\x99s going to change you. So, get ready to start tearing down all those defensive walls you put up because Uranus isn\xe2\x80\x99t having it anymore. What do you do with this information? Well, for one, be at peace with the reality that you can\xe2\x80\x99t control everything. Let that tension and anxiety leave your body. Two, it\xe2\x80\x99s good to do some creative visioning, especially around relationships. If you\xe2\x80\x99re single and looking for connection, what\xe2\x80\x99s the most radical thing that can change about how you relate to a romantic partner? Can you envision a totally different version of relationship, one that is more authentic to you? If you are in a committed relationship, where are you stuck? What needs to change in you connection? Let\xe2\x80\x99s not forget that Mars also changes signs on May 15, moving into Aquarius. Since Aquarius forms the foundation of your chart, the coming weeks will focus you in the home and with family. It will also get you seriously thinking about your roots and the choices you make about some of the most fundamental things in your life. Mars may bring a change in the home, from superficial and cosmetic changes to a move or a shift in your living situation. It may also bring unexpected news or disruption. Mars in this part of your chart tends to be noisy, but it also pulls you to nest. With so much up in the air and your life at a crossroads, it\xe2\x80\x99s important to get back to basics, focusing on creating a strong base for your life so that you can roll with these powerful transformations.

First, it\xe2\x80\x99s worth noting that you\xe2\x80\x99re halfway through a year long chapter of pulling back, rest, retreat, and reflection. It\xe2\x80\x99s a more spiritual time for you, one spend more inward than outward. Not that that is suddenly going to change \xe2\x80\x94 Jupiter, your ruling planet, is still behind the scenes until November 8 \xe2\x80\x94 BUT there\xe2\x80\x99s a big change on the horizon this month. Uranus will enter Taurus, kicking off a seven year chapter of reinventing your daily life. This may read a abstractly, but Uranus\xe2\x80\x99s arrival in Taurus is in sharp contrast to the low key vibe you\xe2\x80\x99ve been cultivating since last October. In short, some of the fundamental aspects of your daily life are going to change. Like how? Well, you may be getting a restless urge to breakout of patterns or habits. You may be looking to make a radical change in what you eat or how you take care of your body. Your work or something about your schedule may change in a big way. And this is something that\xe2\x80\x99s going to play out for the next seven years. See, Uranus isn\xe2\x80\x99t change for change\xe2\x80\x99s sake. It\xe2\x80\x99s a planet that wants to shake up how you see a certain area of your life because something about it has gotten stale or restrictive. And you should know all about this. Over the last seven years, when Uranus made its way through Aries, you\xe2\x80\x99ve had to reinvent yourself, your identity, and how you express yourself. There\xe2\x80\x99s something about you that\xe2\x80\x99s fundamentally different. It\xe2\x80\x99s not that you are a new person in the sense that you became something that you are not, but rather you (hopefully) gained the confidence to be the person you already were deep down inside. Honestly, Sag, it\xe2\x80\x99s been a liberation, although not without a mess at times. As your daily life gest a switcheroo, there may be a part of you that\xe2\x80\x99s still hanging back. (Jupiter, your ruling planet, is in retrograde until July 10.) That said, when Mars changes signs on May 15, you may have a lot more to say than usual and, to be fair, you\xe2\x80\x99re a sign that\xe2\x80\x99s known for its opinions. Try to exercise some tact and charm. After all, you have Venus in your relationship sign until May 19. It\xe2\x80\x99s a good time to make new partnerships and connections, btw. Just try to make nice as everything goes topsy-turvy. Then, on May 29, a Sagittarius Full Moon will put you in the spotlight, pushing you to take action or make yourself known. It may make for an emotional end to May, one that may inspire you to dream or vision something new for yourself. With Jupiter making a trine to Neptune, maybe miracles do happen.

They\xe2\x80\x99ve likely coincided with some of the most challenging experiences you\xe2\x80\x99ve been through. Caught between the planets Uranus and Pluto, your life likely looks very different in some way, too. You may also physically look different. You may live in a different home. You may feel light years away from where you were when this decade began. The good news is that come May 15 Uranus will leave Aries, the sign that forms the foundation of your chart. When it moves into Taurus, it will kick off seven years of reinventing your identity, how you express who you are, and even your confidence. And let\xe2\x80\x99s face it, you could use more confidence after all the ups and downs you\xe2\x80\x99ve been through. I would look at it this way. Having been stripped down to your core, what do you intentionally create in its place? That may be a hard question to answer right now, but I think it\xe2\x80\x99s safe to say that Uranus is helping you to think outside of the box. Maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s time to paint? Bake? Anything that gets the creative energy flowing. And the new moon, also on May 15, will give you a powerful restart. On the same day Mars will also change signs. (Yes, May 15 is supercharged with cosmic shifts.) Arriving in Aquarius, Mars will heat up themes around money, income, stability, and your material needs. With so much happening on that day, it\xe2\x80\x99s possible that you may have to confront an issue around value and worth, something that presses on an emotional button. Nevertheless, the rest of May and into the next few months will motivate you to create more material stability in your life. You may be making new purchases or gathering what you need to nest and feel comfortable. Looking ahead to May 19, Venus will arrive in Cancer, bringing attention to your relationships for the rest of the month and helping you to make new connections as well as tend to existing partnerships. By the end of the month, on May 29, a full moon will put the spotlight on your spiritual side. You may feel pulled inward as you arrive in June, needing to rest and relax after an action packed May.

With both Mars, Saturn, and Pluto all joining up over the last month, you\xe2\x80\x99ve perhaps been more emotional or sensitive than usual, your dreams more intense, your mood more existential. Getting poked and prodded by the cosmos hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been the greatest, but it\xe2\x80\x99s brought up some things about yourself that have heretofore been in your blindspot. Seeing how you\xe2\x80\x99ve been more sensitive, perhaps you\xe2\x80\x99ve been feeling the rumbles of change growing louder, perhaps you\xe2\x80\x99ve been getting restless knowing that you\xe2\x80\x99re at a major cross roads. Already last year and this year have been big years for you. You\xe2\x80\x99ve likely see some powerful shifts, especially in relationship or in your one-on-one connections. But it\xe2\x80\x99s Uranus\xe2\x80\x99s arrival in Taurus on May 15 that will really mark this year, kicking off a seven year story around home and family. Uranus is the planet of reinvention, awakening, and even revolution. So, it\xe2\x80\x99s arrival to one of the most fundamental areas of your chart will mean that the very axis of your life is moving. Over the coming years you may be literally changing home, moving to a place that is quite different from where you live. You may see a transformation in how you emotionally connect with others, opening up some of the more intimate parts of yourself. You may be dealing with issues with family or ancestry. You may need to make a break from the past. With your roots transforming, you may need to seek out new nourishment. Nevertheless, it\xe2\x80\x99s a new season and one that will get an extra jolt when Mars arrives in Aquarius on May 15 \xe2\x80\x94 the same day that Uranus changes signs. With Mars in Aquarius, the second half of the month will be active and dynamic. You\xe2\x80\x99ll feel a motivation to move forward, to make changes, and take command of your life. You may find yourself taking on more responsibilities, too. But it\xe2\x80\x99s quite possible that you\xe2\x80\x99re mulling over a career change or a shift in your professional direction. Careful that you\xe2\x80\x99re not too argumentative or aggressive because Mars isn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly known for its diplomatic touch. Instead, channel positive Mars through leadership, exercise, and acts of courage. By the end of May, with the full moon on May 29, you may have a decision to make about your future as well as friendships, community, and social network. In fact an opportunity may be opening for you. Dream big. Want to learn more about how the astrology of May will affect you?

It\xe2\x80\x99s a year for you to explore, travel, search for answers, and invest in your education. But it\xe2\x80\x99s important to take stock that while you\xe2\x80\x99re out there in the world, that your feet are on the ground. In fact, the last seven years have been a long lesson in you reconnecting with earth. As a Pisces, you have a tendency to float through life, the physical world often feeling too harsh. But what Uranus\xe2\x80\x99s long journey through Aries taught you was the power of resource, from money and income to food and shelter. How has your sense of these things transformed since 2011? Meditate on this question throughout the first half of May because as Uranus closes out it time in Aries, it may give you one last push, one last test to see what you learned about taking care of your material life in a powerful new way. Then, come May 15, Uranus will change signs, kicking off a new seven year story around communication and learning. This will be a revolution for your voice as well as your mind. Since you\xe2\x80\x99re a sensitive sign, Uranus may overload or speed up your thoughts. You may have a million ideas, but not sure where to start. Your natural psychic abilities may be stronger than ever. Again, don\xe2\x80\x99t forget to stay grounded. Make sure you\xe2\x80\x99re breathing and really connected to your body if that happens. Otherwise the restlessness or the anxiety may be too much. (Since you\xe2\x80\x99re a Pisces, your go-to remedies have always been a long bath or time spent in water.) On the same day that Uranus changes signs, Mars will as well. Moving into the last house of your chart, a quiet, contemplative area, you may feel the need to pull back, rest, and retreat for the rest of the month. Mars in this part of your chart is typically low energy, but it looks like you\xe2\x80\x99re getting pulled in different directions in May. Just make sure you\xe2\x80\x99re taking care of your emotional and spiritual needs. By the end of the month, a full moon on May 29 will put the spotlight on your career or professional life. This may be a time to make a change, change positions, or change direction. With a beautiful alignment between Jupiter and Neptune, whatever changes you make may feel divinely led or guided. You may be traveling for work or you may be seeing the world, all to enrich your mind as well as your soul. Want to learn more about how the astrology of May will affect you?

"b'One of the most controversial aspects of fashion magazines, and the fashion industry, is models. Specifically, how young they are and how thin they are. It\'s a topic that continues to create endless debate, in the press and in the community. As the editor of Australian Vogue, my opinion was constantly sought on these issues, and the images we produced in the magazine were closely scrutinised. It\'s a precarious subject, and there are many unpleasant truths beneath the surface that are not discussed or acknowledged publicly.\n\nWhen I first began dealing with models in the late 1980s we were generally drawing from a pool of local girls, who were naturally willowy and slim, had glowing skin, shiny hair and loads of energy. They ate lunch, sparingly for sure, but they ate. They were not skin and bones. I don\'t think anyone believes that a model can eat anything she wants, not exercise and still stay a flawless size 8 (except when they are very young), so whatever regime these girls were following was keeping them healthy.\n\nBut I began to recognise the signs that other models were using different methods to stay svelte. I was dressing a model from the US on a beauty shoot, and I noticed scars and scabs on her knees. When I queried her about them she said, nonchalantly: ""Oh yes. Because I\'m always so hungry, I faint a lot."" She thought it was normal to pass out every day, sometimes more than once.\n\nOn another shoot I was chatting to one of the top Australian models during lunch. She had just moved to Paris and was sharing a small apartment with another model. I asked her how that was working out. ""I get a lot of time by myself actually,"" she said, picking at her salad. ""My flatmate is a \'fit model\', so she\'s in hospital on a drip a lot of the time."" A fit model is one who is used in the top designer ateliers, or workrooms, and is the body around which the clothes are designed. That the ideal body shape used as a starting point for a collection should be a female on the brink of hospitalisation from starvation is frightening.\n\nThe longer I worked with models, the more the food deprivation became obvious. Cigarettes and Diet Coke were dietary staples. Sometimes you would see the tell-tale signs of anorexia, where a girl develops a light fuzz on her face and arms as her body struggles to stay warm. I have never, in all my career, heard a model say ""I\'m hot"", not even if you wrapped her in fur and put her in the middle of the desert.\n\nSociety is understandably concerned about the issues surrounding body image and eating disorders, and the dangerous and unrealistic messages being sent to young women via fashion journals. When it comes to who should be blamed for the portrayal of overly thin models, magazine editors are in the direct line of fire, but it is more complex than that. The ""fit"" model begins the fashion process: designer outfits are created around a live, in-house skeleton. Few designers have a curvy or petite fit model. These collections are then sent to the runway, worn by tall, pin-thin models because that\'s the way the designer wants to see the clothes fall. There will also be casting directors and stylists involved who have a vision of the type of woman they envisage wearing these clothes. For some bizarre reason, it seems they prefer her to be young, coltish, 6ft tall and built like a prepubescent boy.\n\n\'I was horrified to hear what the industry was covering up\' \xe2\x80\xa6 Kirstie Clements, former editor of Vogue Australia. Photograph: Anthony Reginato / Newspix / Rex\n\nIt is too simplistic to blame misogynistic men, although in some cases I believe that criticism is deserved. There are a few male fashion designers I would like to personally strangle. But there are many female fashion editors who perpetuate the stereotype, women who often have a major eating disorder of their own. They get so caught up in the hype of how brilliant clothes look on a size 4, they cannot see the inherent danger in the message. It cannot be denied that visually, clothes fall better on a slimmer frame, but there is slim, and then there is scary skinny.\n\nDespite protestations by women who recognise the danger of portraying any one body type as ""perfect"", the situation is not improving. If you look back at the heady days of the supermodels in the late 80s and early 90s, beauties such as Cindy Crawford, Eva Herzigov\xc3\xa1 and Claudia Schiffer look positively curvaceous compared to the sylphs of today. There was a period in the last three years when some of the girls on the runways were so young and thin, and the shoes they were modelling so high, it actually seemed barbaric. I would watch the ready-to-wear shows on the edge of my seat, apprehensive and anxious. I\'m not comfortable witnessing teen waifs almost on the point of collapse\n\nCindy Crawford in 1999 \xe2\x80\xa6 curvaceous compared to the sylphs of today. Photograph: Graham Whitby-Boot/Sportsphoto Ltd.\n\nAfter the shows, the collection is made available for the press to use for their shoots. These are the samples we all work with and they are obviously the size of the model who wore them on the runway. Thus, a stylist must cast a model who will fit into these tiny sizes. And they have become smaller since the early 90s. We\'ve had couture dresses arrive from Europe that are so minuscule they resemble christening robes. There are no bigger samples available, and the designer probably has no interest in seeing their clothes on larger women. Many high fashion labels are aghast at the idea of producing a size 14, and they certainly wouldn\'t want to see it displayed in the pages of the glossies.\n\nAs a Vogue editor I was of the opinion that we didn\'t necessarily need to feature size 14-plus models in every issue. It is a fashion magazine; we are showcasing the clothes. I am of the belief that an intelligent reader understands that a model is chosen because she carries clothes well. Some fashion suits a curvier girl, some doesn\'t. I see no problem with presenting a healthy, toned, Australian size 10 [UK 8-10]. But as sample sizes from the runway shows became smaller, 10 was no longer an option and the girls were dieting drastically to stay in the game.\n\nIt is the ultimate vicious cycle. A model who puts on a few kilos can\'t get into a sample size on a casting and gets reprimanded by her agency. She begins to diet, loses the weight, and is praised by all for how good she looks. But instead of staying at that weight, and trying to maintain it through a sensible diet and exercise, she thinks losing more will make her even more desirable. And no one tells her to stop.\n\nGirls who can\'t diet their breasts away will have surgical reductions. They then enter into dangerous patterns of behaviour that the industry \xe2\x80\x93 shockingly \xe2\x80\x93 begins to accept as par for the course. We had a term for this spiral in the office. When a model who was getting good work in Australia starved herself down two sizes in order to be cast in the overseas shows \xe2\x80\x93 the first step to an international career \xe2\x80\x93 we would say in the office that she\'d become ""Paris thin"". This dubious achievement was generally accompanied by mood swings, extreme fatigue, binge eating and sometimes bouts of self-harming. All in the quest to fit into a Balenciaga sample.\n\nNot every model has an eating disorder, but I would suggest that every model is not eating as much as she would like to. In 1995 I cast a lovely Russian model for a studio shoot in Paris, and I noticed that by mid-afternoon she hadn\'t eaten a thing (we always catered). Her energy was fading, so I suggested we stop so she could have a snack. She shook her head and replied: ""No, no. It is my job not to eat."" It was one of the only sentences she knew how to say in English.\n\nA few years later we booked another Russian girl, who was also starving herself, on a trip to Marrakech. When the team went out to dinner at night she ordered nothing, but then hunger would get the better of her and she would pick small pieces of food off other people\'s plates. I\'ve seen it happen on many trips. The models somehow rationalise that if they didn\'t order anything, then they didn\'t really take in the calories. They can tell their booker at the agency before they sleep that they only had a salad. By the end of the trip, she didn\'t have the energy to even sit up; she could barely open her eyes. We actually had her lie down next to a fountain to get the last shot.\n\nIn 2004, a fashion season in which the girls were expected to be particularly bone-thin, I was having lunch in New York with a top agent who confidentially expressed her concern to me, as she did not want to be the one to expose the conspiracy. ""It\'s getting very serious,"" she said. She lowered her tone and glanced around to see if anyone at the nearby tables could hear. ""The top casting directors are demanding that they be thinner and thinner. I\'ve got four girls in hospital. And a couple of the others have resorted to eating tissues. Apparently they swell up and fill your stomach.""\n\nI was horrified to hear what the industry was covering up and I felt complicit. We were all complicit. But in my experience it is practically impossible to get a photographer or a fashion editor \xe2\x80\x93 male or female \xe2\x80\x93 to acknowledge the repercussions of using very thin girls. They don\'t want to. For them, it\'s all about the drama of the photograph. They convince themselves that the girls are just genetically blessed, or have achieved it through energetic bouts of yoga and eating goji berries.\n\nI was at the baggage carousel with a fashion editor collecting our luggage after a trip and I noticed a woman standing nearby. She was the most painfully thin person I had ever seen, and my heart went out to her. I pointed her out to the editor who scrutinised the poor woman and said: ""I know it sounds terrible, but I think she looks really great."" The industry is rife with this level of body dysmorphia from mature women.\n\nIn my early years at the magazine there was no minimum age limit on models, and there were occasions that girls under the age of 16 were used. Under my editorship, the fashion office found a new favourite model \xe2\x80\x93 Katie Braatvedt, a 15-year-old from New Zealand. We had her under contract: the idea being that Vogue grooms and protects the girls at the beginning of their careers. But in April 2007 I ran a cover of Katie wearing an Alex Perry gown standing in a treehouse, and received a storm of protest, from readers and the media, accusing us of sexualising children. I lamely debated the point, claiming that the photographs were meant to be innocent and charming, but in the end I had to agree wholeheartedly with the readers. I felt foolish even trying to justify it. I immediately instigated a policy that we would not employ models under the age of 16. Internationally Vogue has since launched a project called Health Initiative, instigated by the US Vogue editor-in-chief, Anna Wintour, which bans the use of models under 16 and pledges that they will not use models they know to be suffering from eating disorders. The first part you can police. The second is disingenuous nonsense, because unless you are monitoring their diet 24/7, you just can\'t be sure.\n\n\'The deference she commands from people is astonishing to watch\' \xe2\x80\xa6 Anna Wintour. Photograph: Astrid Stawiarz/Getty Images\n\nI had no dealings with Wintour during those years, and on the few occasions we were introduced, her sense of froideur was palpable. The deference she commands from people is astonishing to watch. There appears to exist some kind of psychological condition that causes seemingly sane and successful adults to prostrate themselves in her presence. It\'s not just respect \xe2\x80\x93 it\'s something else. People actually want to be scared witless of her, so she obliges. After they had met me, people would often say: ""You\'re so nice and normal"" \xe2\x80\x93 often I think with a tinge of disappointment, wishing I\'d been just a little bit like Wintour. I could never win. I was either expected to be terrifying or snobbish. And I don\'t consider myself either.\n\nBeing a Vogue editor is precarious. It\'s a job everybody in the industry desires, and most people are convinced they could do it better. I was harder on myself than anybody would be if I made a mistake, and when you\'re the editor of Vogue, your slip-ups are very public. Traditional publishing is under enormous pressure, with declining revenues and readership, and decisions are being made to radically cut costs and do anything to please the advertiser. For me, this is perilous. I still believe in the magic.\n\nThis is an edited extract from The Vogue Factor by Kirstie Clements.

"b'Japanese fashion label\n\nComme des Gar\xc3\xa7ons (also known as CDG) is a Japanese fashion company and label founded and headed by Rei Kawakubo in Tokyo and Paris. The label began in 1969 and the company was founded in 1973. Its Japanese flagship store is in Aoyama, Tokyo. It also establishes country-wide and world-wide store chain for various lines of products, including Dover Street Market, in major cities such asLondon, Melbourne, Hong Kong, and New York City.[1] Other than fashion, it expands its business to jewelry and perfume.[2]\n\nThe company shows their main collections during Paris Fashion Week and Paris Men\'s Fashion Week.[3] In 2017 it was reported that the company and its affiliates generates a revenue ""of over $280 million a year"".[4]\n\nHistory [ edit ]\n\nThe label was started in Tokyo by Rei Kawakubo in 1969 and established as a company in 1973. It is written in Japanese as \xe3\x82\xb3\xe3\x83\xa0\xe3\x83\xbb\xe3\x83\x87\xe3\x83\xbb\xe3\x82\xae\xe3\x83\xa3\xe3\x83\xab\xe3\x82\xbd\xe3\x83\xb3 (Komu de Gyaruson), and translates as ""like boys"" in French.[5] The brand\'s name was inspired by Francoise Hardy\'s 1962 song ""Tous les gar\xc3\xa7ons et les filles"", particularly from the line Comme les gar\xc3\xa7ons et les filles de mon \xc3\xa2ge.[6] The brand became successful in Japan in the 1970s and a menswear line was added in 1978. In 1981 the company had a debut show in Paris. Kawakubo\'s heavy use of black, as well as distressed fabrics and unfinished seams, were viewed negatively by French critics.[7]\n\nThroughout the 1980s, its clothes often were associated with a distressed and punk oriented style. In 1982, Kawakubo\'s collection which she named ""Destroy"" was heavily criticized. ""Women\xe2\x80\x99s Wear Daily called it the \'Hiroshima bag lady look,\' and the Associated Press proclaimed Kawakubo the \'high priestess of the Jap wrap.\'"" Unusual styles continued through the 1990s, many of which were disliked by experts.[8] But the company carried on, and in 2004, the company split business into handmade garments in France and non-handmade garments in Japan, Spain and Turkey. Product lines like Deux, Shirt, Tricot, Homme Plus Evergreen, Junya Watanabe, and Ganryu are handmade in France.[9] The product line Play, which is the most recognizable and mainstream CDG brand, is largely produced in Japan, Spain and Turkey, but some of its product are handmade in France.[9]\n\nPlay is the company\'s casual luxury line. It has a heart-shaped logo with two eyes. It is targeted at the younger market and is the best selling clothes line of the company.[citation needed] Filip Pagowski designed the heart logo and stitched onto Play pieces.[citation needed]\n\nPlay introduced collaborations with Nike, Jordan, and Louis Vuitton.[10] Dover Street Market Group carries both Play products and higher-end lines of the company.[citation needed]\n\nFashion [ edit ]\n\nIts collections are designed in the studio in Aoyama, Tokyo and manufactured in Japan, France, Spain, and Turkey. Over the years, the company has recurrently associated itself with the arts and cultural projects internationally. The 1997 spring-summer collection, often referred to the lumps and bumps collection, which contained fabric in bulk and balls on the garments, led to a collaboration, also in 1997, between Rei Kawakubo and New York-based choreographer Merce Cunningham called Scenario. The 2006 autumn/winter collection dealt with the concept of the persona,[11] the different ways to present self to the world. Fusing tailored menswear with more feminine elements such as corsets and flower printed dress fabrics, Persona was another collection that combined the feminine with the masculine.\n\nJunya Watanabe[12][13] and, as of recently, Tao Kurihara[14][15] have started their own sub-labels under the label. Both also were involved in designing for the casual women\'s knitwear line Tricot.\n\nComme des Gar\xc3\xa7ons dress\n\nThe company have collaborated with various other labels over the years such as Hammerthor[16] and H&M.[17][18]\n\nBj\xc3\xb6rk wore the label in the music video for Isobel.[citation needed] Some celebrities refer to the label and the founder. Frank Ocean devoted a song to the founder.[citation needed] John Waters devoted a chapter of his 2010 book Role Models to the label and founder.[citation needed] Swedish musician Jonna Lee collaborated with the company in the creation of her audiovisual album Everyone Afraid to Be Forgotten, where the fashion house designed the costumes for the film.[citation needed]\n\nExhibitions [ edit ]\n\nAfter the Paris d\xc3\xa9but, the company exhibited photographs by Peter Lindbergh at the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris in 1986.[19] In 1990, it held an exhibition of sculpture. And again in 2005 it held an exhibition in Shinjuku, Tokyo of advertising and graphic designs.\n\nIn August 2010, the company opened a 19,000 square feet (1,800 m2), six-level flagship store in Seoul, South Korea, featuring a branded art-exhibition space, its first outside Japan.[20]\n\nIn May 2017, Metropolitan Museum of Art of New York held a fashion exhibition with theme Rei Kawakubo/Comme des Gar\xc3\xa7ons Art of the In-Between.[21]\n\nPerfume [ edit ]\n\nThe company also produces a line of agendered fragrances, most of which are unconventional in the world of perfume aligned with the styles of its garments.[22]\n\nThe company released its first fragrance, Comme des Gar\xc3\xa7ons, in 1994 [23] and its first anti-perfume Odeur 53 in 1998.[24] The anti-perfume is a blend of 53 non-traditional notes to create a modern and striking scent.[25] Some of these notes are oxygen, flash of metal, wash drying in the wind, mineral carbon, sand dunes, nail polish, cellulose, pure air of the high mountains, burnt rubber and flaming rock.[citation needed] Director John Waters and architect Stephen Alesch both wear the fragrance.[26][27]\n\nThe company also released the Luxe series Champaca, for which artist Katerina Jebb produced the visuals.[citation needed]\n\nAdrian Joffe, the founder\'s husband and the CEO of the company, set up two companies. Comme des Gar\xc3\xa7ons Parfums is for licensing some of the perfumes to Puig from 2002[28][29] and Comme des Gar\xc3\xa7ons Parfums Parfums for selling the rest by its own.[30]\n\nThe company developed a unisex fragrance, G I R L and released it on 28 August 2014.[31] Artist KAWS designed the bottle.[32]\n\nComme des Gar\xc3\xa7ons lines [ edit ]\n\nDesigned by Rei Kawakubo\n\nComme des Gar\xc3\xa7ons \xe2\x80\x93 main womenswear line (since 1969)\n\nComme des Gar\xc3\xa7ons Noir \xe2\x80\x93 black-dominated womenswear collection (since 1987)\n\nComme des Gar\xc3\xa7ons Comme Des Gar\xc3\xa7ons \xe2\x80\x93 (a.k.a. \'Comme Comme\') womenswear (since 1993)\n\nComme des Gar\xc3\xa7ons Homme Plus \xe2\x80\x93 main menswear line (since 1984)\n\nComme des Gar\xc3\xa7ons Homme Plus Sport \xe2\x80\x93 sporty subline of Homme Plus\n\nComme des Gar\xc3\xa7ons Homme Plus Evergreen \xe2\x80\x93 subline of Homme Plus, re-invented items from past collections (since 2005)\n\nComme des Gar\xc3\xa7ons Homme Deux \xe2\x80\x93 formal tailored menswear (since 1987)\n\nComme des Gar\xc3\xa7ons Shirt \xe2\x80\x93 shirt-dominated collection (since 1988)\n\nComme des Gar\xc3\xa7ons Shirt Girl\n\nComme des Gar\xc3\xa7ons Shirt Boy (since 2014, discontinued 2019)\n\nComme des Gar\xc3\xa7ons Girl (since 2015)\n\nPlay Comme des Gar\xc3\xa7ons \xe2\x80\x93 casual streetwear for younger men and women with bug-eyed heart logo (collaboration with New York City graphic artist Filip Pagowski )\n\nBLACK Comme des Gar\xc3\xa7ons \xe2\x80\x93 unisex, lower-priced line, initially started due to the recession in 2008, and also sold in signature BLACK pop-up shops.\n\nDesigned by Junya Watanabe\n\nComme des Gar\xc3\xa7ons Homme \xe2\x80\x93 menswear Japanese line (since 1978)\n\nComme des Gar\xc3\xa7ons Robe de Chambre \xe2\x80\x93 womenswear Japanese line (discontinued)\n\nJunya Watanabe Comme des Gar\xc3\xa7ons \xe2\x80\x93 womenswear (since 1992)\n\nJunya Watanabe Comme des Gar\xc3\xa7ons Man \xe2\x80\x93 menswear (since 2001)\n\nJunya Watanabe Comme des Gar\xc3\xa7ons Man Pink \xe2\x80\x93 menswear items for women (discontinued)\n\nDesigned by Tao Kurihara\n\nTao Comme des Gar\xc3\xa7ons \xe2\x80\x93 womenswear (launched 2005, discontinued after spring 2011)\n\nTricot Comme des Gar\xc3\xa7ons \xe2\x80\x93 womenwear knits\n\nDesigned by Fumito Ganryu\n\nGanryu Comme des Gar\xc3\xa7ons \xe2\x80\x93 asexual street style label, Ganryu was a former pattern-maker at Junya\n\nDesigned by Kei Ninomiya\n\nNoir Kei Ninomiya \xe2\x80\x93 womenswear (launched in 2013), Ninomiya was a former pattern-maker at CdG\n\nAccessories\n\nComme des Gar\xc3\xa7ons Edited \xe2\x80\x93 special items for Edited shops in Japan\n\nComme des Gar\xc3\xa7ons Pearl \xe2\x80\x93 jewelry (since 2006)\n\nComme des Gar\xc3\xa7ons Parfum \xe2\x80\x93 (since 1994)\n\nComme des Gar\xc3\xa7ons Parfum Parfum\n\nComme des Gar\xc3\xa7ons Wallet\n\nSpeedo Comme des Gar\xc3\xa7ons \xe2\x80\x93 swimwear collaboration (since 2005)\n\nHammerthor Comme des Gar\xc3\xa7ons Shirt \xe2\x80\x93 underwear collaboration (since 2007)\n\nOthers\n\nComme des Gar\xc3\xa7ons Peggy Moffitt\n\nComme des Gar\xc3\xa7ons Six \xe2\x80\x93 bi-annual magazine (from 1988 to 1991)\n\nStores [ edit ]\n\nAoyama Store\n\nSignature boutiques are located in London (as Dover Street Market), Paris, New York City,[33] Beijing,[34] Hong Kong,[35] Seoul, St. Petersburg, Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka, Fukuoka.

"b'Months ago, I waffled over whether to re-read American Gods before the TV show started airing. Did I want to experience the show as its own unique thing or should I go back to the book and reacquaint myself with the plot? The decision to go back to Neil Gaiman\xe2\x80\x99s modern fantasy epic won out and I feel like I made the right choice, one that will change the way I watch the series.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBased on what I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen of the upcoming American Gods TV show, the main difference between the series and the award-winning 2001 novel it\xe2\x80\x99s based on will be one of tonal approach. Both things tell the same story, where an ex-con named Shadow acts as bodyguard to older con man Wednesday as the latter prepares for a reckoning between old and new gods, but the color gradients feel different.\n\n\n\nThe TV adaptation of American Gods glimmers more brightly than the book. It\xe2\x80\x99s not in the art direction or color choices so much as the self-consciously askew aesthetic of the show, which presents a fictional landscape where celestial energies are still flowing through the world. They show up in sharp neon contrast to the mundanity that we know. There\xe2\x80\x99s a puckish playfulness in the performances, special effects, and shot angles that make the Starz series vibrate on a radiant wavelength.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRevisiting the book while encountering the show makes the original text feel like it\xe2\x80\x99s done up in a somber, more nuanced palette. Gaiman\xe2\x80\x99s 2001 novel wears its intentions on its lapel like a boutonniere flower and is more of a character piece concerned with sketching out Shadow\xe2\x80\x99s reactions to the long, strange trips he gets sent on. American Gods\xe2\x80\x99 journey is one that happens through texts and traditions and Shadow\xe2\x80\x99s arc throughout the book has him meeting deities and culture heroes who have been long forgotten. The book shows that we lose important pieces of the past when society moves on to worship new phenomena.\n\nOne thing the show won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to do is seductively evoke an encyclopedic knowledge of myth and literature the way Gaiman does in the book. It\xe2\x80\x99s long been a snarky compliment that Gaiman writes so he can show off what he\xe2\x80\x99s read and American Gods teems with tangents and asides concerned with mythological ephemera from cultures all over the world. This signature practice rarely comes across as self-indulgent, though, because Gaiman makes it clear why he\xe2\x80\x99s telling you about piskies, djinn, or thunderbirds. You might need to wait several hundred pages for the payoff, but the trust he asks for is earned.\n\n\n\nG/O Media may get a commission AirPods Pro $170 at Amazon\n\nThe book clearly means to be a sweeping consideration of the metaphysics of the polyglot American soul, talking about what it means to believe in a higher power, move to a new land, and how the latter act impacts the former. There\xe2\x80\x99s a cycle that American Gods investigates in an appropriately itinerant fashion: native people were here on this continent, other people came\xe2\x80\x94either by free will or in bondage\xe2\x80\x94and then displaced them in horrific ways. The migration patterns and available levels of agency for various groups changed over the centuries, but it was a constant that these different peoples had faith systems and folkways that they bought with them. In highlighting the different textures and bracing similarities of the small towns, big cities and dangerous dreamscapes that Shadow moves through, Gaiman illuminates the promise and threat of the idea that America is a place where anything can happen.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHaving just finished re-reading the 750-page, author\xe2\x80\x99s preferred version of American Gods, I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking that there\xe2\x80\x99s no way that the show will be able to touch on everything Gaiman accomplishes in the novel. Book passages do get used almost verbatim in the show, but the audience\xe2\x80\x99s demands on the two forms of entertainment are so different that changes have to happen. But I like knowing where the book went and seeing where the show will diverge. I already prefer the TV version of Laura and Technical Boy to their book counterparts because they feel more aligned to the current cultural moment.\n\nThat kind of cross-media change isn\xe2\x80\x99t a new paradigm, but the effect here winds up making the book\xe2\x80\x99s very existence even more mythological. Now the novel is itself a metaphorical story that\xe2\x80\x99s being built upon and re-interpreted for a new age, like the myths that Gaiman builds on. American Gods is a meta-myth that\xe2\x80\x99s getting a new layer laid on top of it, an exceedingly appropriate fate for a book about what happens to gods as the times and places change.'"
"b""It was reported earlier this week that he is moving into his own home.\n\nAnd it seems like Rob Kardashian won't be alone.\n\nThe 28-year-old will be joined in his new house by his model girlfriend Blac Chyna according to a Wednesday report from E! News.\n\nScroll down for video\n\nMoving in? Rob Kardashian will be joined in his new home by his model girlfriend Blac Chyna according to a Wednesday report from E! News\n\nA source told the entertainment site: 'Chyna has been helping Rob with the house. She pretty much will be living there once it is up and running.\n\n'They both have discussed moving in with each other. They feel this is a fresh house and a fresh start for them.'\n\nNo doubt that is a big move as the two have yet to even hit the two month mark of officially dating.\n\nDespite their generally short time together, the youngest Kardashian sibling appears to be fully trusting of the Lashed beauty salon owner as he is letting her control the reins when it comes to the decor of the new property.\n\nMoving on up: It was reported earlier this week that the 28-year-old has bought a $2.3m home in Calabasas\n\nThe insider explained: 'Rob is letting her take control of whatever she wants. She is his queen.\n\n'She is helping with the decorating and the new pieces in the home. They haven't moved in yet, but will very soon.'\n\nChyna also has been helping with Rob's diet and recently shared an Instagram video of the food stocked in his kitchen, according to an article on Wednesday by TMZ.\n\n'Are we supposed to eat this?,' she can be heard saying as the video showed cartons of sorbet, 'raincoast crisps' and I Can't Believe It's Not Butter.\n\n'What is that?!,' Chyna exclaimed as she repeatedly giggled and made Rob laugh.\n\nLots of space: The 4,256 sq ft two-storey house, sits on 12,700 sq ft of land\n\nSources said that Rob and Chyna have a strict rule against eating carbohydrates that has been instrumental in his weight loss.\n\nThe younger brother of Kim Kardashian is seemingly not only welcoming his girlfriend to his new place but also her three-year-old son King Cairo.\n\nShe shares the child with rapper Tyga, who is currently in a relationship with Rob's 18-year-old half-sister Kylie Jenner.\n\nLoved up: Rob and the model have been dating for less than two months but seems certainly seem to be getting hot and heavy between the two as they were spotted putting on an amorous display\n\nThe source said: 'Rob is making a room for Chyna's child....he loves him.'\n\nNo doubt that he is aiming to maintain his 40 pound weight loss as it is claimed that he will have a gym on the property.\n\nRob is the new owner of a $2.3million home in the same exclusive gated Calabasas neighbourhood as his sisters Khloe, Kourtney, and Kylie, and up the road from Kim and even Kris herself, according to TMZ.\n\nAccording to the site, the momager 'helped out' with the purchase, which is under the family trust.\n\nThe 4,256 sq ft two-storey house, on 12,700 sq ft of land, boasts four bedrooms and five bathrooms.\n\nThings certainly seem to be heating up for the couple as UsWeekly recently reported that Rob is so smitten with the pinup that he is not only going to get a tattoo for her, but he is already 'talking about a proposal.'\n\nBig heart: It has been reported that Rob is also making space for Chyna's three-year-old son King Cairo, as they are pictured here during an outing in LA back in January 2014\n\n'He feels he's never been this into a girl and that she's the one for life,' a source said.\n\nThis all comes at an interesting time for the former star of Keeping Up With The Kardashians as he posted an eyebrow-raising message on his Instagram Tuesday evening.\n\nThe full entry read: 'When the p***y good but your family don't like her so you drop your family and become an orphan.'"""

"b'2017 song by Katy Perry\n\n""Bon App\xc3\xa9tit"" is a song by American singer Katy Perry featuring American hip hop group Migos from Perry\'s fifth studio album Witness (2017). It was released as the album\'s second single on April 28, 2017 by Capitol Records. It is a dance-pop, trap-pop, electronic and Euro disco song with lyrics that feature oral sex double entendres involving food. An accompanying music video followed on May 12, 2017, and features Perry being prepared and served by chefs as a meal. As of September 2020, the video has garnered more than 1 Billion views on YouTube. Commercially, the song charted within Top 5 in Israel and Bulgaria, the top twenty in Belgium, Canada, and Panama, and the Top 30 in Scotland, the Philippines, Slovakia, France, and the Netherlands.\n\nComposition [ edit ]\n\nKaty Perry described her fifth album Witness as a ""360-degree liberation"" record, with ""Bon App\xc3\xa9tit"" representing a ""sexual liberation"".[1] She also called it a ""pretty sexual"" song that was part of ""some of that good \'ol Katy Perry, fluffy stuff that you love so much"".[2] ""Bon App\xc3\xa9tit"" is a disco-infused[3] dance-pop,[4] trap-pop,[3] electronic[5] and Euro disco[6] song with a duration of 3 minutes and 47 seconds.[7] According to Hugh McIntyre from Forbes, the track\'s rhythm features ""breezy, summery, 90\'s-invoking vibes"" and a beat that gradually builds, eventually becoming ""undeniable"".[8] MTV writer Sasha Geffen calls the track ""a smorgasbord"" of double entrendres with food saying that ""...""eating"" can only mean two things"",[4] with Anna Gaca of Spin explicitly noting its connotations of oral sex.[9] In the song, Perry sings ""\'Cause I\'m all that you want, boy/All that you can have, boy/Got me spread like a buffet/Bon a, Bon app\xc3\xa9tit, baby"".[10] Christopher R. Weingarten of Rolling Stone found the song similar to the music of AC/DC.[11]\n\nThe song is written in the key of B\xe2\x99\xad Phrygian with a tempo of 106 beats per minute in common time. Perry\'s vocals span from G\xe2\x99\xad 3 to E\xe2\x99\xad 5 .[12]\n\nRelease and promotion [ edit ]\n\nOn April 24, Perry sent out a recipe for the ""World\'s Best Cherry Pie"", teasing the song\'s release. Fans sent photos of their completed pies to Perry on Twitter where she said they ""may get a surprise"" and rated their pies.[13][14] Perry subsequently announced the track\'s release two days later. Capitol Records released it for download on April 28, 2017, as the second single from her upcoming fifth studio album.[7][15] To promote the song on the day of its release, Perry went to Times Square in a food truck to hand out cherry pies to fans.[3] Three days later, she and Migos performed it at the 2017 Met Gala after Perry also sang her songs ""Chained to the Rhythm"", ""Dark Horse"", and ""Firework"". According to Vogue, ""Bon App\xc3\xa9tit"" was the highlight of the show, writing the performance was where ""things really got going"", concluding ""that\'s how you wrap up a Met Gala.""[16]\n\nCritical reception [ edit ]\n\nEntertainment Weekly\'s Nolan Feeney gave ""Bon App\xc3\xa9tit"" a B+ rating writing, ""she is back to garish, stupid-fun party jams that don\'t even try to be subtle about cramming in as many sex metaphors as possible in three-and-a-half minutes. In other words, the kind of songs she\'s best at.""[17] Forbes writer Hugh McIntyre felt the song was ""great pop music"" with potential for success.[8] Jon Carmanica of The New York Times states, ""Ms. Perry is in her least convincing mode\xe2\x80\x94dance-floor diva\xe2\x80\x94but the production is direct and effective.""[18] NME writer Jamie Milton calls ""Bon App\xc3\xa9tit"" a ""recipe for greatness"", and ""supremely confident, addictive, steamed-up sound of summer 2017"". Milton praised Migos\' presence on the song saying they ""could grace any track and make it even better"".[19] Chris Willman of Variety said ""Bon App\xc3\xa9tit"" is, ""a gleefully ridiculous exercise in chewing the comedic scenery by presenting female sexuality as a four-course-plus meal"", noting Perry is moving ""further into a pure EDM-pop realm here"".[20] Idolator\'s Mike Wass ranked it as the 8th best pop song of 2017,[21] and described the song as ""catchy"" as well as a ""tasty treat"", though felt its chorus had too many double entendres.[22]\n\nIn a negative review, USA Today contributor Jayme Deerwester criticized the track\'s production as ""unsubstantial and ultimately unsatisfying"".[23] Spin writer Anna Gaca was equally critical of the song. Gaca called the song ""Katy Perry\'s drooling one-trick pony of a new single, also featuring Migos. It\'s about food and none-too-coded references to Katy Perry\'s vagina, and it will make you a little uncomfortable.""[24] Isha Aran of Fusion was critical of the lyrics and production, while considering the song an improvement to its predecessor commenting ""I can\'t say the song is great (Katy Perry songs always feel incomplete to me, like they\'re giving 70%), but it\'s something of a relief\xe2\x80\x94much less awkward than \'conscious\' Katy.""[25] Perry\'s collaboration with Migos was criticized by media commentators and fans due to the group\'s homophobic comments on American rapper iLoveMakonnen.[26][27][28]\n\nChart performance [ edit ]\n\nIn Australia, the track debuted at number 35 on the ARIA Charts with sales of 4,358 copies.[29] In the United Kingdom, it entered at number 40 on the UK Singles Chart.[30] It later ascended to number 37 in the nation.[31]\n\nIn the United States, the song opened at number 76 on the Billboard Hot 100 dated May 12, 2017, with first week digital downloads of 18,000 copies and an airplay audience of 3.8 million.[32] Following the music video\'s release, it Re-Entered at number 59 in the nation and debuted on the country\'s Streaming Songs chart at number 36 with 11.7 million streams.[33] It also peaked at number 28 on Hot Dance Club Songs, thus breaking her streak of 18 consecutive number-one singles on the chart.[34] In Canada, ""Bon App\xc3\xa9tit"" entered at number 41[35] before rising to number 14.[36] In France, the song debuted at number 37 on May 5, 2017. Following Perry\'s performance on The Voice: la plus belle voix on June 4, 2017, the song peaked at number 9 on June 16, 2017.[37][38]\n\nMusic video [ edit ]\n\nDent De Cuir directed the song\'s music video, which was released on May 12, 2017 and features chef Roy Choi. It first shows Perry wrapped in plastic before chefs cut the wrapping open and ""start kneading her like dough"" before she is boiled in a pot with carrots and prepared like a food while singing her lyrics and Choi serves her as a meal to various cannibalizing patrons. Migos watch and rap their verses as Perry rings the bell, signaling them to turn a switch allowing her to turn the tables on the patrons. In a scene heavily inspired by the 1988 film Beetlejuice, the patrons are then bound, gagged and then dismembered by the chefs as Perry then dances on a pole. Perry then is served a pie containing dismembered body parts of the patrons.[39]\n\nBrian Josephs of Spin criticized the video as ""uncomfortable to watch"", and wrote that it is ""Weird as Hell"".[40] Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Nolan Feeney called it both ""eye-catching"" and ""as creepy as it is bonkers"".[41]\n\nThe video accrued over 16 million views within 24 hours on YouTube, the most since Adele\'s ""Hello"" music video.[42] As of 21 September 2020 , the music video has over 1 billion views.[43]\n\nAt the 2017 MTV Video Music Awards, it was nominated for ""Best Art Direction"".[44]\n\nAwards and nominations [ edit ]\n\nTrack listing [ edit ]\n\nDigital download[7] No. Title Length 1.

Through sheer force of her personality and by simply being herself, she reinvented the talk show and still reigns as the undisputed champ of daytime television.\n\nWinfrey was born in 1954 on a farm in Kosciusko, Mississippi. Her unmarried parents drifted apart and moved elsewhere shortly after her birth, leaving her in the care of her maternal grandmother, a harsh but loving disciplinarian whom Winfrey credits with fostering her outgoing personality and precociousness. Under her grandmother\'s tutelage, she learned to read by the age of 2, and by the time she was 3, her speaking talents had already begun to emerge. She was often invited to recite poetry at social clubs and church teas, where they referred to her as ""the little speaker.""\n\nAt age 6, Winfrey moved to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to live with her mother, who was working as a domestic. Adjusting to life in the urban ghetto after enjoying the peace of a Mississippi farm proved to be a difficult challenge for Winfrey. To make matters worse, her mother was so preoccupied with her own problems that she had little time for Winfrey. This lack of parental supervision left her vulnerable, and beginning when she was 9 and continuing for several years thereafter, Winfrey was sexually abused by several different men, including a teenage cousin and her mother\'s boyfriend. (Years later, during a show she was doing on incest, Winfrey burst into tears and shared with her audience the story of her ordeal.)\n\nConfused, ashamed, guilt-ridden and afraid to tell anyone what was being done to her, Winfrey began to act out. Her increasing belligerence and delinquency proved too much for her mother to handle. She tried to put Winfrey in a detention center, but the institution didn\'t have enough beds, so instead she sent her to live with her father in Nashville, Tennessee. A strict disciplinarian, Winfrey\'s father changed the course of her life. ""My father turned my life around by insisting that I be more than I was and by believing I could be more,"" Winfrey told Good Housekeeping magazine. ""His love of learning showed me the way.""\n\nUnder her father\'s guidance, Winfrey became an honor student and rediscovered her flair for public speaking, emerging as a standout orator. Her speaking skills earned her a scholarship to Tennessee State University, where she majored in speech and drama. In 1973, while only a sophomore, the 19-year-old Winfrey was offered a job as co-news anchor at Nashville\'s CBS affiliate, WTVF-TV, and became not only Nashville\'s first female co-anchor but the first black co-anchor as well.\n\nInspired by her success at WTVF-TV, Oprah left college during her senior year to accept a position in Baltimore with WJZ-TV as co-anchor of the evening news. But she soon found that hard news wasn\'t truly her forte. Deeply empathetic, she had difficulty distancing herself from her work, often having to fight back tears while reporting stories that touched her. Unable to get past this emotional connection to her subjects, she was fired.\n\nFortunately, a new manager at the station saw a way to make a virtue of Winfrey\'s reporting shortcomings. Phil Donahue\'s nationally syndicated talk show had won a large following in Baltimore, and the manager wanted to tap the market with a local version. In 1977, ""People Are Talking"" aired with Winfrey as co-host. Oprah had found her niche. Her uncommon ability to connect intellectually and emotionally with a wide variety of topics made the show an instant success. ""I came off the air,"" she says of her first show, ""and said to myself, \'This is what I should be doing. It\'s like breathing.\'""\n\n""People Are Talking"" rocketed up the ratings chart, eventually becoming the top show of its genre in the Baltimore market. Winfrey\'s success attracted the attention of Chicago-based WLS-TV, which offered her a chance to anchor the station\'s floundering talk show ""AM Chicago."" Winfrey\'s earthy, down-home, comfortable style captivated audiences, and the show became an instant smash hit. It bested even hometown-boy Phil Donahue in the ratings, and was quickly syndicated in 120 cities.\n\nBut Winfrey\'s biggest break came in 1985, when producer Quincy Jones offered her a role in the screen adaptation of Alice Walker\'s The Color Purple. Winfrey\'s acting debut garnered rave reviews, won her nominations for both a Golden Globe and an Academy Award, and catapulted her to national stardom. Riding this wave of publicity, ""The Oprah Winfrey Show"" made its national debut in 1986, and within five months became the third-highest rated show in syndication and the No. 1 talk show, reaching upwards of 10 million people daily in 192 cities.\n\nTo further capitalize on her success, in 1986, Oprah formed Harpo (""Oprah"" spelled backwards) Productions Inc. In 1988, she purchased a state-of-the-art production studio in Chicago and took over ownership and production of ""The Oprah Winfrey Show."" The move made Winfrey only the third woman in history-behind Mary Pickford and Lucille Ball-to own and produce her own show as well as the first African-American, male or female, to own her own entertainment production company.\n\nDuring the 1990s, the airwaves became flooded with talk shows, but Winfrey\'s ratings continued to soar despite the increased competition. Part of the reason for her success is that she has avoided the tabloid ""nuts and sluts"" approach many of her competitors adopted. Choosing to take the high road, she empathized with people in trouble and emphasized solutions to the problems her show revealed, instead of wallowing in the mire of sensationalism. Even more so, she went beyond being merely a talk-show host to become a shaper of American culture. The books she likes invariably become bestsellers. The records of musicians she invites on her show shoot up the charts. And diets concocted by her personal cook have influenced the eating habits of millions.\n\nBy the end of the 1990s, Winfrey\'s $415 million talk empire had made her the wealthiest woman in show business and one of the most powerful figures in the television industry. Her recipe for success is simple: ""Follow your instincts,"" she says in a Ladies Home Journal magazine article. ""That\'s where true wisdom manifests itself.""\n\nComic Relief\n\nTo polish her instinctive flair for entertainment and improve her spontaneity, Oprah Winfrey once studied improvisation with Chicago\'s Second City comedy troupe, whose alums include such famous comedians as Dan Aykroyd, John Belushi and John Candy.\n\nA Really Bad Hair Day\n\nWhile Oprah Winfrey was co-anchoring the evening news in Baltimore, an assistant news director decided that her hair was ""too thick"" and sent her to an expensive New York City salon for a makeover-with disastrous results. A botched permanent left her completely but temporarily bald, and she was forced to cover her scalp with a scarf. Although she cried ""constantly,"" she found in the ordeal an opportunity for self-discovery, admitting in a Ms. magazine interview, ""You learn a lot about yourself when you\'re bald.""'"

"b'Share this: email\n\nQ: My daughter is 13 and an eighth grader in middle school. Her friends have recently become obsessed with the Netflix show, 13 Reasons Why. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t read the book or watched the show, but have been seeing a few news articles that worry that the show may be dangerous for kids to watch graphic depictions of suicide, bullying and forced sex. My daughter feels that it is only \xe2\x80\x9cdrama\xe2\x80\x9d (in the teen use of the word), and she\xe2\x80\x99s been feeling left out of the conversation with her friends. Is it ok for me to let her watch it?\n\n~ Just One Reason Why Not, USA\n\nA: Dear Just,\n\nYour question is timely. Many parents (and educators, judging from the flurry of school-parent communication around the country) have been concerned about the content of 13 Reasons Why and its massive popularity among pre-teens and teens. It is currently the most popular Netflix show on social media, in part because it is being heavily marketed to adolescents, with a personal social media campaign from Executive Producer and powerful teen influencer, Selena Gomez. The show\xe2\x80\x99s subject matter is titllating because it is, as your daughter says \xe2\x80\x9cteen drama\xe2\x80\x9d. The problem is that she and her peers may not yet be neurodevelopmentally capable of processing that \xe2\x80\x9cdrama\xe2\x80\x9d in healthy, safe ways.\n\nAlthough it is based on a popular YA novel (for readers 12-18), 13 Reasons Why is rated TV-MA (unsuitable for viewers under 17) and several episodes are preceded by an onscreen \xe2\x80\x9cgraphic content\xe2\x80\x9d warning. As you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen with your own daughter, media made for older adolescents and adults are attractive to younger kids. Younger kids\xe2\x80\x99 media consumption is aspirational, meaning that they look to older kids, including media representations, to see how they should act, dress, and behave in the strange new worlds of high school, summer camp, and college. There is a real difference between your 13-year-old daughter reading the book and watching an adult filmmaker\xe2\x80\x99s graphic recreation of the book. And selling an admittedly TV-MA show to a YA readership is just as concerning as cross-marketing children\xe2\x80\x99s action figures based on R-rated movies like Deadpool.\n\nBecause of the normal stage of development at age 13, the decision whether and how your daughter should watch 13 Reasons Why is an important one. The intense emotions, confusion, and behaviors of the show\xe2\x80\x99s characters can be disturbing to any viewer. But younger viewers, who are looking for clues on how to be a teenager and have limited life experience to reference, are especially vulnerable to being upset and activated. As her parent, you know best what your daughter can and cannot handle when it comes to seeing emotionally intense content created by adults whose life experience and brain development provide them perspective and resilience that a 13-year-old does not yet have. If you feel that your daughter isn\xe2\x80\x99t ready to process graphic images of substance abuse, suicide, rape, and physical assault in a healthy and safe way, 13 Reasons Why is not for her.\n\nMore concerning than its graphic visuals is the show\xe2\x80\x99s narrative and how it may be interpreted by young viewers. This is in part because children and teens will not develop brain executive functions such as impulse control and future thinking for more than a decade. Because the plot of 13 Reasons Why revolves around suicide and many of the characters grapple with suicidal thoughts and hurting themselves, this may be interpreted by young viewers as normal adolescent behavior. While teen suicide is the second leading cause of adolescent death in this country, it is fortunately a relatively rare occurrence, and far from \xe2\x80\x9cnormal\xe2\x80\x9d teen behavior. From an adult sensibility, it has been argued that 13 Reasons Why provides an opportunity to bring hush hush subjects like teen suicide, substance use, and rape out into the open. Unfortunately, while the premise and title of 13 Reasons Why claim that it presents the reasons why the main character, Hannah, takes her life, the show neglects the primary reason for her suicide, which is Hannah\xe2\x80\x99s mental health at a time when she has not fully developed impulse control, proving to be a deadly combination.\n\nSuicide primarily results from depression, the most common, and commonly missed, chronic illness. Despite the story presented by 13 Reasons Why, suicide is not a reaction to (or revenge for) what others do to or do not do for someone like Hannah, but arises from depression, her sense of hopelessness and helplessness to make life better. This is the fundamental reality of suicide that is, unfortunately, never addressed in the show. 13 Reasons Why sends a harsh and untrue message that Hannah\xe2\x80\x99s classmates actually cause her death. In the show\xe2\x80\x99s final episodes, the teens note again and again that they killed Hannah. Particularly unnerving is Hannah\xe2\x80\x99s final reason why \xe2\x80\x93 she sought help from the school counselor and received none.\n\n13 Reasons Why concludes with the main protagonist\xe2\x80\x99s realization that a \xe2\x80\x9cchange\xe2\x80\x9d in terms of how he and his peers treat each other is needed \xe2\x80\x93 but specific changes are never mentioned. This missed opportunity to describe how depression feels and how it looks to others is the show\xe2\x80\x99s greatest failure. Not only could it have opened the meaningful discussion of teen suicide that the producers sought, but it would have given viewers the tools to recognize depression, support and care for their friends, and seek care for themselves when they need it.\n\nEvery young person and viewer is going to respond to 13 Reasons Why differently. If you are going to allow your daughter to watch it, discuss some of the themes beforehand. Ask her why she wants to watch the show and what her friends have been saying about it. Then sit down and watch the show together. Help her to process it by discussing ways Hannah could have reached out to her friends, her parents, and her teachers \xe2\x80\x93 and the different outcomes that might have resulted had she done so. Think together about what Hannah\xe2\x80\x99s friends could have noticed, what they might have done had they known about her depression, and to whom they might have reached out. Explicitly note that the school counselor is not an accurate portrayal of a responsible mental health professional. Make sure your daughter knows that you are there for her, and that others are there for her as well. Identify the people in your daughter\xe2\x80\x99s life to whom she can turn when she feels sad, lonely, or helpless. Finally, recognize that 13 Reasons Why is a work of fiction, made more compelling by suggesting you could wreak revenge on peers who have bullied you or that the boy or girl you had a crush on will pine for you and avenge your death. But these are emotionally manipulative and unrealistic clich\xc3\xa9s of entertainment that glamorize and romanticize \xe2\x80\x9cteen drama.\xe2\x80\x9d There is no glamor or romance in the tragedy of a child taking her own life. None.\n\nEnjoy your media and use them wisely,\n\n~ The Mediatrician\xc2\xae\n\nAdditional resources:'"

I did it in one day.\n\nLet me explain: My father\xe2\x80\x99s best friend since summer camp, \xe2\x80\x9cUncle\xe2\x80\x9d John, had known Jason and me separately our whole lives, but Jason and I had never met. I went to college out east and took my first job in California. When I moved back home to Chicago, John \xe2\x80\x94 who thought Jason and I were perfect for each other \xe2\x80\x94 set us up on a blind date.\n\nIt was 1989. We were only 24. I had precisely zero expectations about this going anywhere. But when he knocked on the door of my little frame house, I thought, \xe2\x80\x9cUh-oh, there is something highly likable about this person.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBy the end of dinner, I knew I wanted to marry him.\n\nJason? He knew a year later.\n\nI have never been on Tinder, Bumble or eHarmony, but I\xe2\x80\x99m going to create a general profile for Jason right here, based on my experience of coexisting in the same house with him for, like, 9,490 days.\n\nFirst, the basics: He is 5-foot-10, 160 pounds, with salt-and-pepper hair and hazel eyes.\n\nThe following list of attributes is in no particular order because everything feels important to me in some way.\n\nHe is a sharp dresser. Our young adult sons, Justin and Miles, often borrow his clothes. Those who know him \xe2\x80\x94 or just happen to glance down at the gap between his dress slacks and dress shoes \xe2\x80\x94 know that he has a flair for fabulous socks. He is fit and enjoys keeping in shape.\n\nIf our home could speak, it would add that Jason is uncannily handy. On the subject of food \xe2\x80\x94 man, can he cook. After a long day, there is no sweeter joy than seeing him walk in the door, plop a grocery bag down on the counter, and woo me with olives and some yummy cheese he has procured before he gets to work on the evening\xe2\x80\x99s meal.'"
"b'Kurt Russell Beats Up James Corden in \'Late Late Show\' Sketch\n\nTry as he might, Corden can\'t escape the actor.\n\nJames Corden has learned to cower every time Kurt Russell comes along.\n\nIn a new bit for The Late Late Show, Russell\'s friendly greetings to Corden are quick to turn violent, escalating from one encounter to the next. At first, they meet and Russell talks about how cool and fun Corden is, giving him a ""light"" punch on the arm that leaves Corden clutching himself in pain.\n\nThe next time they interact, he kicks Corden in the face while telling him how much he loves him.\n\n""I love you too, you crazy bastard,"" Corden says as he lays in the fetal position on the floor.\n\nThe third incident is particularly volatile, with Russell happily throwing Corden through walls with a smile.

For other uses, see Fyre (disambiguation)\n\nNot to be confused with Fyter Fest\n\n2017 fraudulent music festival\n\nFyre Festival was a fraudulent luxury music festival founded by Billy McFarland, CEO of Fyre Media Inc, and rapper Ja Rule. It was created with the intent of promoting the company\'s Fyre app for booking music talent. The festival was scheduled to take place on April 28\xe2\x80\x9330 and May 5\xe2\x80\x937, 2017, on the Bahamian island of Great Exuma.\n\nThe event was promoted on Instagram by social media influencers including Kendall Jenner, Bella Hadid, Hailey Baldwin and Emily Ratajkowski, many of whom did not initially disclose they had been paid to do so.[1] During the Fyre Festival\'s inaugural weekend, the event experienced problems related to security, food, accommodation, medical services and artist relations, resulting in the festival being postponed indefinitely. Instead of the luxury villas and gourmet meals for which festival attendees paid hundreds of dollars, they received prepackaged sandwiches and FEMA tents as their accommodation.[2]\n\nIn March 2018, McFarland pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud to defraud investors and ticket holders, and a second count to defraud a ticket vendor that occurred while out on bail.[3] In October 2018, McFarland was sentenced to six years in prison and ordered to forfeit US$26 million.[3] The organizers became the subject of at least eight lawsuits, several seeking class action status, and one seeking more than $100 million in damages. The cases accuse the organizers of defrauding ticket buyers.\n\nTwo documentaries about the events of the festival were released in 2019: Hulu\'s Fyre Fraud,[4] and Netflix\'s Fyre: The Greatest Party That Never Happened.[5][6] It was also featured on an episode of the CNBC series American Greed in 2019.[7]\n\nPlanning and organization [ edit ]\n\nBilly MacFarland and Ja Rule at the 2016 Web Summit\n\nAn aircraft featuring Fyre Festival branding, used to transport attendees to the festival.\n\nThe festival was organized by Billy McFarland and Ja Rule,[2] to promote the Fyre music booking app.[1] Ja Rule had come to know McFarland through regular visits to events McFarland hosted at his previous venture, Magnises. During a flight to the Bahamas, McFarland and Ja Rule\'s private plane touched down on a lightly populated island which they later discovered was Norman\'s Cay, the former private island of Carlos Lehder Rivas, a kingpin of the Medell\xc3\xadn Cartel.[8] McFarland then leased the island from the current owners, with the owners giving the strict condition that McFarland make no reference to Pablo Escobar (leader of the Medell\xc3\xadn Cartel) in any marketing materials.[9][10]\n\nPromotional footage with hired supermodels was shot on Norman\'s Cay, and planning for the festival went ahead. On December 12, 2016, Kendall Jenner, Emily Ratajkowski and other influencers paid by Fyre simultaneously posted to their Instagram feeds a video with a thumbnail consisting of an orange square and a logo made of stylized flames. The video showed Bella Hadid and other models represented by her agency running around a tropical beach. Text with the video promised ""an immersive music festival ... two transformative weekends ... on the boundaries of the impossible"". This was the beginning of the Fyre Festival\'s promotional campaign, during which McFarland himself claimed that the island had been owned by Pablo Escobar.[11] The owners cancelled their arrangement with McFarland soon after.[12]\n\nIn reality, Pablo Escobar never owned Norman\'s Cay. When they were kicked off of Norman\'s Cay, they only had four months before their inaugural festival on April 28\xe2\x80\x9330th. After several small islands that seemed like likely venues were turned down, and with only two months to go before the Fyre Festival, the Bahamian government gave McFarland a permit to use a site set aside for development at Roker Point (Coordinates: ) on Great Exuma, just north of the Sandals Resort.[11] Material released on social media continued to promote the falsehood that the Festival was being hosted on Pablo Escobar\'s private island, with maps of the site altered to make it appear as if Roker Point was an island unto itself.[9]\n\nIn reality, the Festival was in a remote parking lot north of a Sandals Resort and a nearby marina where locals\' boats were stored.[citation needed] Furthermore, Great Exuma was not a private or remote island. Instead, the festival was scheduled to take place in an abandoned resort development. McFarland never announced the change; he just simply renamed the island ""Fyre Cay"". With no infrastructure and no villas, the team had just under two months to turn Roker Point into Fyre Cay.\n\nAn investor, fashion executive Carola Jain, reportedly arranged for Fyre to receive a $4 million loan, which the company used most of to rent luxurious offices in Manhattan\'s Tribeca neighborhood. With no experience staging an event of the proposed festival\'s scale, McFarland began approaching companies that did, and was reportedly taken aback when informed the event would cost at least $50 million to stage in the time available as he had promised. Furthermore, the more experienced consultants told them that in addition to the cost, an event of this magnitude would have needed an extra year to plan. He and his associates at Fyre believed it would cost far less and continued with their plans under that assumption. The organizers tried to do things themselves where possible; McFarland supposedly learned how to rent the stage by doing a Google Search.[11]\n\nIn the days leading up to the festival, they cut expenses extensively, having learned that the luxury villas were going to cost $10 million alone, and targeted deposits for the bands, food, infrastructure and staff.\n\nScheduled for two weekends in April and May 2017, the event sold day tickets from US$500 to US$1,500, and VIP packages including airfare and luxury tent accommodation for US$12,000. Customers were promised accommodation in ""modern, eco-friendly, geodesic domes""[13] and meals from celebrity chefs.[14] The final advertised lineup was for 33 groups, including Pusha T, Tyga, Desiigner, Blink-182, Major Lazer, Disclosure, Migos, Rae Sremmurd, Kaytranada, Lil Yachty, Matoma, Klingande, Skepta, Claptone, Le Youth, Tensnake, Blond:ish, and Lee Burridge.[15] In the days leading up to the festival, all of the aforementioned acts pulled out, with Major Lazer never confirming their attendance despite being advertised. To make matters worse, organizers of the Fyre Festival planned their first event for April 28\xe2\x80\x9330th, the same weekend as the Exuma Regatta, a Bahamian sailing race series that utilized most of the island\'s hotels, vacation rentals and resources.\n\nWhile the festival\'s promotional material kept claiming that the festival would be held on a remote private island that once belonged to drug trafficker Pablo Escobar, workers were busy preparing Roker Point for the festival, scattering sand over its rocks and improving a road to a nearby beach, where they built some cabanas and installed swing seats.[11]\n\nOn the mainland, 5,000 tickets had been sold, and an air service was hired to charter festival-goers from Miami. A medical-services company and caterer were also hired, but the latter withdrew a few weeks before the festival.[11] With only two weeks to go, a new catering service with a $1 million total budget was hired, drastically reduced from the $6 million originally allocated to provide for what was promised as ""uniquely authentic island cuisine...local seafood, Bahamian-style sushi and even a pig roast"".[9][16]\n\nIn March 2017, Fyre also hired a veteran event producer, Yaron Lavi, who saw that it was impossible to hold the sort of event McFarland and Ja Rule envisioned at the site. He assumed they would postpone the event to November as they had been discussing since they were not ready. However, when Fyre told him they would stage the event in the spring anyway, Lavi told them to abandon plans for temporary villas and instead erect tents, the only accommodation that could be delivered in the time remaining. Lavi advised Fyre to make this clear to those who had already bought tickets, as otherwise it would be damaging to their brand. He says the company assured him that an email was being prepared, but he was not sure if it was sent.[11]\n\nComcast Ventures considered investing $25 million in the Fyre app, which McFarland apparently hoped would allow him to finance the festival, but declined days beforehand.[17] Reportedly, McFarland had valued Fyre Media at $90 million but was unable to provide sufficient proof of that when Comcast requested it.[11]\n\nWriting for New York magazine, one of the event organizers later noted that since at least mid-March there were significant problems with the planning, and at one point it was suggested they reschedule the 2017 festival until 2018.[18]\n\nThese plans, however, were revoked at the last minute with the decision to go on with the event as planned. ""Let\'s just do it and be legends, man,"" one of the organizers is reported to have said.[18] Later that month, Page Six began reporting rumors that the festival organizers were too disorganized and ""in over their heads.""[19]\n\nAfter the Comcast deal fell through, McFarland obtained some temporary financing for Fyre through investor Ezra Birnbaum that required the company repay at least US$500,000 of the loan within 16 days.[11]\n\nIn order to raise quick cash for the event, and with under two weeks to go before the inaugural event, Fyre informed ticket-holders that the event would now be ""cashless (and cardless),"" and encouraged attendees to put up thousands of dollars in advance on a digital Fyre Band to cover purchases at the festival, according to one lawsuit. Each attendee would be issued an RFID-equipped, smartwatch-like ID to use during the festival;[20] this was despite warnings that such digital bracelets would be useless because of the poor Wi-Fi connection at the site.[9]\n\nMcFarland, who signed the email, suggested that attendees deposit $300\xe2\x80\x93500 for every day they planned to attend. About $2 million from festival goers was taken for these bracelets, 40% of which, according to a lawsuit later filed by Birnbaum, was used by McFarland to pay off the short-term loan.[11][21]\n\nFestival events and attendee experiences [ edit ]\n\nEarly in the morning of April 27, heavy rain fell on Great Exuma, soaking the open tents and mattresses piled out in the open air for guest arrivals later that day.\n\nThe first flights from Miami International Airport to Exuma International Airport, operated by Swift Air and Xtra Airways, landed at 6:20 a.m.[9] That afternoon, Blink-182 announced that it was withdrawing from the festival, stating in a Twitter post that: ""We\'re not confident that we would have what we need to give you the quality of performances we always give our fans.""[9]\n\nInitial arrivals were brought to an ""impromptu beach party"" at a beachside restaurant, where they were plied with alcohol and kept waiting for around six hours while frantic preparations at the festival site continued.[9] McFarland had hired hundreds of local Bahamian workers to help build the site. Meanwhile, organizers had to renegotiate the guarantees they offered to the people who would be playing at the festival as costs spiraled out of control. Later arrivals were brought directly to the grounds by school bus where the true state of the festival\'s site became apparent: their accommodations were little more than scattered disaster relief tents with dirt floors, some with mattresses that were soaking wet as a result of the morning rain. The gourmet food accommodations were nothing more than inadequate and poor quality food (including cheese sandwiches served in foam containers).[22][23]\n\nFestival-goers were dropped off at the production bungalow where McFarland and his team were based so they could be registered, but after hours of waiting in vain, people rushed to claim their own tents.[9] Although there were only about 500 people, there were not enough tents and beds for the guests, so they wound up stealing from others. Attendees were unable to leave the festival for the nearby Sandals resorts as it was peak season, with almost every hotel on Great Exuma already fully booked for the annual Exuma Regatta. Around nightfall, a group of local musicians took to the stage and played for a few hours, the only act to perform at the event. In the early morning, it was announced that the festival would be postponed and that the attendees would be returned to Miami as soon as possible.\n\nReports from the festival mentioned various other problems, such as the mishandling or theft of guests\' baggage, no lighting to help people find their way around, an unfinished gravel lot, a lack of medical personnel or event staff, no cell phone or internet service, portable toilets,[24] no running water and heavy-handed security. These problems were exacerbated as the festival had been promoted as a cashless event, leaving many attendees without money for taxi fare or other expenses.\n\nMany attendees were reportedly stranded, as flights to and from the island were cancelled after the Bahamian government issued an order that barred any planes from landing at the airport.[2][25]\n\nThe first flight back to Miami boarded at 1:30 a.m. on April 28, but was delayed for hours due to issues with the flight\'s manifest. It was cancelled after sunrise, and passengers were locked in the Exuma Airport terminal with no access to food, water[26] or air conditioning; a passenger recalled that at least one person passed out from the heat and had to be hospitalized.[11]\n\nThe flight eventually left Exuma that morning, and more charter flights to Miami departed from Exuma throughout the day. One attendee who was stuck in Miami reported that the pilot of their airplane had told them to get off so they could turn the plane around for immediate departure, as they were now serving as a rescue aircraft to get attendees off Great Exuma Island.[citation needed]\n\nInvolved parties [ edit ]\n\nOrganizers [ edit ]\n\nWith US$3,100,000 (equivalent to about $3,400,000 in 2019) in venture capital and 25 employees, McFarland also founded a card company called Magnises in 2013,[27] which promised members paying an annual $250 fee that they could ""unlock their cities and take their lives to the next level"", including ""private members-only concerts, tastings with notable chefs, and exclusive art previews at top galleries"". The Washington Post reported that ""some of those benefits never materialized or were far from what was advertised"".[28] ""They send the same email for every problem, but it\'s like fill-in-the-blanks for what the problem is"", a member reported to Business Insider.[29] Magnises reportedly became profitable in 2015.[29]\n\nThe Washington Post also reported that McFarland ""has a history of overpromising"" in his previous business ventures, and cited multiple examples, including McFarland selling VIP tickets to the musical Hamilton for $430 then cancelling at the last minute. In a complaint to the Better Business Bureau, one customer seeking a refund reported getting no response to multiple queries for over a month and a half.[28]\n\nCelebrity and social media promoters [ edit ]\n\nThe event was promoted on Instagram by Kardashian family socialite Kendall Jenner (who was paid $250,000 and has since deleted the post), Bella Hadid, Emily Ratajkowski, Hailey Baldwin, Elsa Hosk, Chanel Iman, Lais Ribeiro, Alessandra Ambrosio, Shanina Shaik, Nadine Leopold, Rose Bertram, Gizele Oliveira, Hannah Ferguson, and other niche-actresses and media personalities.[1] Ratajkowski was reportedly the only actress or model to use the hashtag #ad,[30] but has also since deleted the post.[31] Only later was it reported that Jenner and the others had been paid to make the posts, something they were required under federal law to disclose. The Federal Trade Commission said #ad only worked at the beginning of paid posts, and that the hashtag alone was not a sufficient disclaimer.[31][32]\n\nHadid has acknowledged and apologized for participating in the promotion.[33] Baldwin revealed that she donated her entire payment to charity after seeing the aftermath of the event.[34]\n\nFuckJerry and Jerry Media were partially responsible for promotions and social media marketing, and were possibly[clarification needed] responsible for the Netflix documentary that neglected to acknowledge their involvement and participation in the event marketing.[35]\n\nAftermath [ edit ]\n\nJa Rule posted a note on Twitter that said ""it was NOT A SCAM"" and ""this is NOT MY FAULT"".[36]\n\nFyre Festival posted a statement on their website:\n\nFyre Festival set out to provide a once-in-a-lifetime musical experience on the Islands of the Exumas. Due to circumstances out of our control, the physical infrastructure was not in place on time and we are unable to fulfill on that vision safely and enjoyably for our guests. At this time, we are working tirelessly to get flights scheduled and get everyone off of Great Exuma and home safely as quickly as we can. We ask that guests currently on-island do not make their own arrangements to get to the airport as we are coordinating those plans. We are working to place everyone on complimentary charters back to Miami today; this process has commenced and the safety and comfort of our guests is our top priority. The festival is being postponed until we can further assess if and when we are able to create the high-quality experience we envisioned. We ask for everyone\'s patience and cooperation during this difficult time as we work as quickly and safely as we can to remedy this unforeseeable situation. We will continue to provide regular updates via email to our guests and via our official social media channels as they become available.[37]\n\nMany news organizations compared the chaos to William Golding\'s novel Lord of the Flies and Suzanne Collins\'s novel The Hunger Games.[38][39][40][41] The Bahamas Ministry of Tourism apologized on behalf of the nation, and denied having any responsibility for how the events unfolded.[42] The workers who constructed the site and the restaurant that provided meals for festival staff were never paid, leading to the restaurant owner appealing for assistance on the crowdfunding platform GoFundMe.[43]\n\nFyre Festival announced that it would offer all attendees a choice between a full refund or VIP tickets to the following year\'s festival (which was proposed, but never happened).[44][45]\n\nLawsuits [ edit ]\n\nAs a result of the festival, McFarland and Ja Rule are the subject of a $100 million lawsuit in the state of California, with Ja Rule later being dismissed from the lawsuit by the Judge in July 2019.[46] It was filed on behalf of plaintiff Daniel Jung by entertainment lawyer Mark Geragos, who is seeking class action status for the lawsuit with more than 150 plaintiffs.[47] Per the filing, Jung\'s lawsuit alleges fraud, breach of contract (partly because of the decision by the organizers to make the festival cashless so that attendees didn\'t bring money for taxis), breach of covenant of good faith (partly due to the inadequate catering and the incident where attendees were locked in the airport) and negligent misrepresentation.[48] Ben Meiselas of Geragos\'s firm pledged to hold ""all those who recklessly and blindly promoted the festival"" accountable, which was interpreted as being directed at Jenner, Hadid, and other social media influencers.[49] A Geragos lawyer stated that Fyre Festival sent cease and desist letters to whistleblowers.[50]\n\nA second class action lawsuit against Fyre Media, McFarland, Ja Rule, and the event promoters identified as ""Does 1\xe2\x80\x93100"" was filed in Los Angeles by personal injury lawyer John Girardi on behalf of three attendees.[51] The plaintiff alleges that they deceived patrons into attending the festival by paying more than 400 social media personalities and celebrities to promote it. The parties are accused of breach of contract, negligent misrepresentation, and fraud [52] however this lawsuit was later dismissed.[53] A Bloomberg reporter filed a FOIA request to the FTC regarding their Instagram knowledge, after the second class action lawsuit.[51]\n\nA third lawsuit was filed in New York federal court against Ja Rule, McFarland, Fyre Media, and chief marketing officer Grant Margolin. Plaintiffs Matthew Herlihy and Anthony Lauriello accused the festival organizers of ""false representations, material omissions... negligence, fraud, and violations of consumer protection statutes.""[54] ""Upon the arrival of guests to the island of Great Exuma for the first weekend, the island was lacking basic amenities, was covered in dirt, and guests had to sleep in tents with wet blankets,"" the suit claims. ""There were no communal showers or bathrooms as promised; instead there were porta potties (only about one for every 200 yards) that were knocked down and only three showers although there were hundreds of people arriving."" however this lawsuit was dismissed in November 2019 with the Judge granted plaintiffs limited leave to replead with respect to particular allegations against Ja Rule.[55]\n\nOn May 4, another lawsuit was filed by National Event Services (NES), which provided medical services for the festival and claimed to have suffered $250,000 in damages, alleging breach of contract, fraud, and negligence by the organizers. The suit alleged that Fyre ""failed and/or refused"" to buy cancellation insurance and ""failed to secure a contract with a medical evacuation helicopter or plane."" NES employees reported that the local medical clinic was closed and the accommodation was ""uninhabitable"" with ""bug infestation, bloodstained mattresses, and no air conditioning.""\n\nAlso in May, festival attendee Andrew Petrozziello filed a lawsuit in New Jersey federal court alleging that the organizers violated the state\'s consumer fraud act and committed breach of contract.[56]\n\nA sixth lawsuit, filed in Florida federal court as a class action suit, alleged violations that include fraud, negligence, and breach of contract. The plaintiffs, Kenneth and Emily Reel, accused the organizers of sending cease and desist letters to people who criticized the festival on social media.[57]\n\nA seventh lawsuit was filed in Manhattan federal court as a class action suit on behalf of Sean Daly and Edward Ivey. In addition to the infractions mentioned in the other lawsuits, this suit alleges unjust enrichment and violation of New York state business law, claiming that the organizers continued to offer VIP upgrades and opportunities to deposit money into the ""Fyre Band"" payment system after the festival had been canceled.[58]\n\nAn eighth lawsuit was filed in Suffolk County Superior Court in Boston on behalf of ticketing vendor Tablelist. The company is alleging that the festival organizers and financial backers committed breach of contract and fraudulently deceived Tablelist and ticket purchasers. Tablelist is seeking $3.5 million to refund customers, as well as damages resulting from loss of business after being forced to lay off 40% of their workforce to focus on the litigation.[59]\n\nOn July 3, 2018, two North Carolina attendees, Seth Crossno and Mark Thompson, were awarded $5 million in damages. The judgment was granted against Billy McFarland in absentia after he failed to respond to the court proceedings. Ja Rule was initially named as a co-defendant, but was later removed from the suit after an undisclosed private agreement with the two attendees\' attorney.[60]\n\nJa Rule said in January 2019 that he had also been defrauded by McFarland;[61] in November 2019, he was dismissed from a class action lawsuit filed by festival attendees, the judge determining that it had not been proven his promotion of the festival on social media had directly led to the plaintiffs\' attending.[62]\n\nCriminal investigation [ edit ]\n\nOn May 21, 2017, The New York Times reported McFarland and his associates were under an active federal criminal investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation for mail fraud, wire fraud, and securities fraud. The case was overseen by the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York.[63] On June 30, 2017, McFarland was arrested and charged with one count of wire fraud.[64]\n\nIn March 2018, McFarland pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud in what the U.S. Justice Department called a scheme to defraud investors, as well as a second count of wire fraud related to a scheme to defraud a ticket vendor. In October 2018, McFarland was sentenced to six years in prison and ordered to forfeit US$26 million.[3][65][66]\n\nOn July 24, 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced that McFarland, two companies he founded, a former senior executive, and a former contractor agreed to settle charges arising out of an extensive, multi-year offering fraud that raised at least $27.4 million from over 100 investors. McFarland admitted to the SEC\'s allegations against him, agreed to a permanent director-and-officer bar, and agreed to disgorgement of $27.4 million. Grant H. Margolin, Daniel Simon, Fyre Media, and Magnises, Inc. agreed to the settlement without admitting or denying the charges. Margolin has agreed to a seven-year director-and-officer bar and must pay a $35,000 penalty, and Simon has agreed to a three-year director-and-officer bar and must pay over $15,000 in disgorgement and penalty. The settlements are subject to court approval.[67]\n\nCompensation [ edit ]\n\nLike other Bahamian suppliers, the caterer who worked on the event was not paid; in 2019 a crowdfunding appeal raised over $200,000 to compensate her.[68][69] In 2020 the United States Marshals Service auctioned Fyre Festival-branded merchandise that McFarland had kept for future sale, with the proceeds to go to victims.[69]\n\nFilms [ edit ]\n\nIn 2019, two documentary films were released that covered the Fyre Festival and McFarland.\n\nFyre Fraud, directed by Jenner Furst and Julia Willoughby Nason, premiered on Hulu on January 14, 2019. On the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 79% approval rating with an average rating of 6.41 out of 10, based on 28 reviews.[70] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 66 out of 100, based on 12 critic reviews, indicating ""generally favorable reviews.""[71]\n\nFyre, directed by Chris Smith, was released by Netflix on January 18, 2019. Like Fyre Fraud, the film received positive reviews. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 90% rating with an average rating of 7.54 out of 10, based on 73 reviews.[72] On Metacritic, the film holds a score of 76 out of 100, based on 26 critic reviews, indicating ""generally favorable reviews.""[73]\n\nIn popular culture [ edit ]\n\nIn a 2017 tweet, Seth Rogen stated that The Lonely Island comedy trio were planning a movie about a failed music festival.[74] In 2019, Jorma Taccone confirmed that the parody film was still in process.[75]\n\nIn 2018, American punk band Alkaline Trio \xe2\x80\x93 whose singer and guitarist Matt Skiba also plays in Blink-182, who were among the first acts to cancel their planned performance at the festival \xe2\x80\x93 released the song ""Goodbye Fire Island"", which was inspired by Blink-182\'s involvement with the festival.[76]\n\nIn 2019, Ryan Reynolds featured Andy King and his signature quote from the Fyre documentary in an advertisement for his gin brand.[77]\n\nSee also [ edit ]'"

"b'A few days after Chris Soules\xe2\x80\x99 arrest for allegedly leaving the scene of a fatal car crash, police have obtained a search warrant for the results of his blood test, a law enforcement source tells Us Weekly.\n\nThe season 19 Bachelor, 35, was driving his pickup truck on Monday, April 25, when he rear-ended a tractor trailer. Soules called 911 and checked the victim\xe2\x80\x99s pulse, but the tractor driver, Kenneth Mosher, later died as a result of his injuries. Hours later, Soules was arrested at his home in Arlington, Iowa.\n\nAccording to TMZ, the search warrant allows police to obtain Soules\xe2\x80\x99 blood test results from the hospital. However, the results may not be accurate, because when police arrived to arrest Soules, there was a delay while they obtained a search warrant to enter his home. \xe2\x80\x9cChris did stay in his home and would not come out until the police provided a search warrant to enter his home,\xe2\x80\x9d the law enforcement source tells Us. (The Buchanan County Sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s Office has no comment.)\n\nHe later went to a hospital for medical attention and a blood test. TMZ says police may be interested in the results to determine if alcohol or drugs were a factor in the accident. The site reported that Soules allegedly had alcoholic beverage containers in his possession at the time of the crash, but he was not charged with driving under the influence.\n\nTMZ also reports that police have obtained a search warrant for the red Chevy that picked up Soules from the scene of the accident. Per the Associated Press, a judge sealed the warrants that let police obtain the blood samples and to enter Soules\xe2\x80\x99 home.\n\nThe reality star has been holed up in his home in the aftermath of the incident. \xe2\x80\x9cChris has a location-monitoring device on his leg and had to surrender his passport,\xe2\x80\x9d a source told Us earlier this week. The ankle monitor was a precaution because Soules previously \xe2\x80\x9chad plans to leave the country\xe2\x80\x9d before his arrest.\n\nSoules has retained Des Moines attorneys Alfredo Parrish, Brandon Brown and Gina Messamer. In a statement to Us Weekly, the legal team says, \xe2\x80\x9cSoules\xe2\x80\x99 911 call, released yesterday, proved that the initial knee-jerk coverage of this accident was incorrect. While initial reports suggested Soules fled the scene, the 911 call confirms that Soules in fact was the one who contacted law enforcement immediately. During the call, he clearly identified himself and explained his role in the terrible accident. Soules attempted to resuscitate Mr. Mosher and remained on the scene with him until emergency medical personnel arrived.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe statement continued: \xe2\x80\x9cHis attorneys are confident that once all the evidence is made public, it will show Soules acted reasonably and did everything in his power to provide aid to Mr. Mosher. Due to the nature of the pending charges, neither Soules nor his counsel will be making any statements at this time. Soules and his family request that their privacy and the privacy of Mr. Mosher\xe2\x80\x99s family is respected.\xe2\x80\x9d'"

"b'What to know before diving into Netflix\'s \'Casting JonBenet\'\n\nErin Jensen | USA TODAY\n\nShow Caption Hide Caption Watch the trailer for \'Casting JonBenet\' Netflix takes a unique look at the mysterious death of JonBenet Ramsay in \'Casting JonBenet,\' available for streaming April 28.\n\nCorrections & clarifications: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated the length of the documentary. It is one hour and twenty minutes.\n\nCasting JonBen\xc3\xa9t is not your typical true crime documentary du jour. Rather, it serves as a contrast to the numerous programs devoted to the villainy that aired on CBS, Investigation Discovery, Lifetime and Dr. Phil last year.\n\nThose yearning to resolve this two-decade-old crime need to check those lofty ambitions at the foot of the bed or armrest of the couch prior to devouring the one hour and 20-minute film to sidestep disappointment. The latest directorial exploit from Kitty Green (Ukraine Is Not a Brothel and The Face of Ukraine: Casting Oksana Baiul) does not provide puzzle pieces or insight as to why the lifeless body of JonBen\xc3\xa9t Ramsey was discovered in December of 1996.\n\nInstead of focusing on friends of the six-year-old beauty queen\'s parents, John and Patsy Ramsey, or investigators, the lens turns to local actors in the Boulder community to be featured in limited reenactments. Also, unlike its title suggests, auditions for the role of the blonde beauty are only a tiny fraction of the film.\n\nConfused? Green\'s approach is certainly a unique way to look at the case. Over the course of 15 months, filmmakers met with the Coloradans and sought out their beliefs about the crime. The result is a documentary that conveys popular theories about the case as well as biases.\n\nDuring their auditions, many reveal a tie to the incident. A voice teacher\'s students knew JonBen\xc3\xa9t. A hopeful vying for the part of Patsy revealed her parents met the Ramsey matriarch and patriarch ""several times,"" because her brother\'s murder connected the grieving parents. Another actor revealed he was ""effectively (his girlfriend\'s) alibi,"" because she was slated to be John\'s successor, therefore, police believed she had something to gain.\n\nThe amateur thespians recall details of JonBen\xc3\xa9t\'s death, though not everyone\'s speech is dripping with confidence or certainty. They talk about the ransom note, totaling almost three pages, which was addressed on CBS\' docu-series The Case of: JonBen\xc3\xa9t Ramsey last September. Their comments are similar to ones that could be heard at a brunch with friends discussing the latest episode of the popular podcast My Favorite Murder.\n\nThey mention the length of the letter discovered by Patsy, along with the highbrow language used, and the fact that it was written with pen and paper belonging to the Ramseys, which, even without training, they found peculiar. A man who spoke of performing at weddings but not investigative experience declared that a kidnapper would typically request a rounded amount, not the $118,000 specified. It seems the media, with some sensationalized reports and a surplus of shows surrounding the 20th anniversary of the crime, have made us all experts.\n\nSimilarly, one actress expresses her doubts that a 9-year-old \xe2\x80\x94 the age of JonBen\xc3\xa9t\'s brother Burke at the time of her death \xe2\x80\x94 would have the strength inflict the head injury she suffered. In juxtaposition, the camera then cuts to young boys successfully splitting a watermelon with a flashlight, the weapon some believe was used to kill JonBen\xc3\xa9t.\n\nFurther showcasing the strong beliefs held, some women freely spew their opinions of Patsy, despite not knowing her directly. \xe2\x80\x9cShe was no longer doing the beauty queen thing,"" one surmises. ""She\xe2\x80\x99d gotten too old and so this was her opportunity to live it again through her daughter.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThose who watch the film will quickly understand that its centerpiece is not a child\'s untimely and cryptic death; Green\'s focal point is one that has been less frequently addressed. Turning not to the stone, but its ripple, the subsequent conversations and attitudes formed about a family that intrigues many but few actually know.\n\nWould it be easy to release the white-knuckled grip on our convictions, formed with the help of experts, to admit that we may never know what happened to that little girl? Are we so desperate to make sense of the senseless act that we cling to theories even if it means persecuting innocent people? These are just a couple of questions to pose while peering into Green\'s mirror.'"

She appeared frequently with her twin sister Nikki as The Bella Twins. She is also a one-time WWE Divas Champion.\n\nEarly life [ edit ]\n\nBrianna Monique Garcia-Colace was born in San Diego, California, and raised on a farm in the Phoenix suburb of Scottsdale, Arizona.[9] She was born sixteen minutes after her twin sister, Nicole, to parents Jon Garcia and Kathy Colace.[10] She is of Mexican and Italian descent.[6] Keen soccer enthusiasts, she along with her sister played for the Scottsdale club in elementary school. She graduated from Chaparral High School in 2002.[10] She then returned to San Diego for college,[9] and relocated to Los Angeles a year later, where she worked as a waitress at the Mondrian Hotel while trying to find an agent.[10]\n\nShe then started modeling, acting, and doing promotional work.[6][11] She made her first national TV appearance on the Fox reality show Meet My Folks.[10][12] Following this appearance, the Garcia twins were hired to be the World Cup Twins for Budweiser and were photographed holding the World Cup trophy.[13] Brie and her sister Nikki were contestants in the 2006 ""International Body Doubles twins search"".[14] Brie and Nikki later participated in the 2006 WWE Diva Search, but they did not make the cut.[15]\n\nProfessional wrestling career [ edit ]\n\nWorld Wrestling Entertainment/WWE [ edit ]\n\nFlorida Championship Wrestling (2007\xe2\x80\x932008) [ edit ]\n\nBrianna and Nicole were signed to developmental contracts by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) in June 2007 and were assigned to Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW), WWE\'s then-developmental territory, in Tampa, Florida.[12] On September 15, 2007, the twins made their in-ring debut. Dubbed The Bella Twins, they defeated Nattie Neidhart and Krissy Vaine with Victoria Crawford as the special guest referee.[1][16] The duo quickly started a scripted rivalry with Neidhart and Crawford, and had a series of matches against them throughout October 2007. As a part of their on-screen personas, they switched places behind the referee\'s back if one of them was hurt. They also occasionally competed in mixed tag team matches, teaming with male wrestlers including Kofi Kingston and Robert Anthony. They also made some non-wrestling appearances on Heath Miller\'s Happy Hour promo segment.[16]\n\nStarting in December 2007, they managed Derrick Linkin,[16] but this storyline was cut short when Linkin was released in January 2008. They then resumed their feud with Neidhart and Crawford, wrestling them throughout much of 2008.[17] After Neidhart was called up to the WWE roster in April 2008, Milena Roucka took her place in the feud.[17][18] The twins also competed in bikini contests, and wrestled against other competitors including Katie Lea Burchill and Daisy. Their last FCW appearance was on September 2, when they competed in a Divas battle royal won by Miss Angela.[17]\n\nThe Bella Twins (2008\xe2\x80\x932011) [ edit ]\n\nOn the August 29, 2008 episode of SmackDown, Brianna debuted as Brie Bella and defeated Victoria.[19] She quickly began a scripted rivalry with Victoria and Victoria\'s accomplice, Natalya, and had a series of matches against them.[20][21][22] In each match, Brie would roll out of the ring and go underneath it, emerging and appearing revived, and then win the match.[20][23] On the October 31 episode of SmackDown, when Brie went under the ring Victoria grabbed her legs, but a second pair of legs kicked her off, implying that a second person was under the ring.[24] The following week on SmackDown, Brie picked up a win against Victoria and then ran under the ring to escape Natalya and Victoria, but Victoria and Natalya both reached for Brie under the ring, resulting in both Nicole and Brie being pulled out. The twins then attacked them and celebrated afterward.[25] Nicole was then introduced as Nikki Bella. The twins had their first official match as a team on the November 21 episode of SmackDown, defeating Victoria and Natalya.[26] They continued competing in tag team matches over the following months.[27][28][29]\n\nRaw event in 2009 Brie (right) and Nikki Bella (left) during aevent in 2009\n\nStarting in November, the twins developed an on-screen relationship with The Col\xc3\xb3ns (Carlito and Primo), appearing in numerous backstage segments with them, and accompanying them to the ring. In February 2009, the storyline expanded to include John Morrison and The Miz, who flirted with the Bellas and took them on a date for Valentine\'s Day.[30][31] The date provoked a rivalry between the teams of The Miz and Morrison and Primo and Carlito, with the four competing for the affection of the twins, who were seemingly unable to choose between them.[32][33] On March 17 on ECW, Carlito and Primo, aiming for Morrison and The Miz, accidentally spat apples in the face of Brie.[34] Nikki began to laugh at Brie\'s misfortune, and a fight broke out between the two, which led to Nikki leaving with The Miz and Morrison, while Brie stayed with Primo and Carlito.[34] Brie won her first match over Nikki in a six-person intergender tag team match on SmackDown the following week,[35] but was defeated by her villainous sister in their first singles match against each other on the edition of March 31 of ECW, after a distraction from Morrison and The Miz.[36]\n\nOn April 15, 2009, The Bella Twins were both drafted to the Raw brand as part of the 2009 supplemental draft.[37] On April 27, Brie made her Raw in-ring debut in an eight-Diva tag team match, which her team won. Nikki also made an appearance, reuniting with her twin, as she was under the ring to help Brie during the match.[38] Nikki then made her in-ring debut for the brand the following month in a battle royal but was eliminated by Beth Phoenix.\n\nOn June 29, 2009, they were both traded to the ECW brand.[39] They returned to ECW the following night on The Abraham Washington Show, as the special guests.[40] They quickly developed a storyline feud with Katie Lea Burchill, when Nikki defeated her in a match by switching places with Brie behind the referee\'s back.[41] The following week on Superstars, Brie defeated Burchill after a similar fashion, and the feud ended in September, when Nikki defeated Burchill on Superstars.[42][43]\n\nOn October 12, the Bellas were traded back to Raw as part of a tri-branded Divas trade,[44] where they predominately appeared in backstage segments with the weekly guest stars and only occasionally competed in matches.[1] On the January 4, 2010, episode of Raw, Brie participated in a tournament for the vacant Divas Championship, but lost to Maryse in the first round, when a switch resulted in Nikki being pinned.[45] In June 2010, they developed a feud with Jillian Hall, when Brie defeated her after switching places with Nikki.[46] The following week, Nikki defeated Hall after switching with Brie.[47] The feud was exacerbated when the Bellas acted as the special guest referees during one of Hall\'s matches. During the match, Hall attacked both twins, but lost the match when Nikki made a fast count, allowing her to be pinned by Gail Kim.[48] The next week on Superstars, the twins defeated Hall and Maryse in a tag team match to end the storyline.[49]\n\nOn August 31, The Bella Twins announced they would be part of the all-female third season of NXT, mentoring Jamie.[50] Jamie was the first rookie Diva eliminated on the October 5 episode of NXT.[51] In November, the twins began a storyline with Daniel Bryan, when Brie accompanied him to the ring for his match. Following his win, Nikki ran out and the two fought over Bryan\'s affection, until Bryan broke it up and had them hug each other.[52] They began to manage Bryan and frequently accompanied him to the ring over the next two months.[53][54] In January 2011, both Bellas turned into villainous characters when they discovered Bryan kissing Gail Kim backstage and assaulted her.[55] They continued to attack Kim, both at the Royal Rumble and on Raw, and on February 7, they teamed with Melina in a losing effort to Kim, Eve Torres, and Tamina.[56][57][58]\n\nDivas Champion (2011\xe2\x80\x932012) [ edit ]\n\nThe Bellas began feuding with Eve Torres after they appeared as lumberjills during a Divas Championship match between Torres and Natalya on the February 14 episode of Raw. Following the match, they attacked Torres backstage before Gail Kim and Natalya stopped them.[1] The next week, the twins defeated Torres and Kim in a tag team match.[59] The following week, Nikki won a battle royal to become the number one contender for the Divas Championship, and unsuccessfully challenged Torres for the championship on March 7.[60][61]\n\nOn April 11, Brie defeated Torres to win the Divas Championship, marking the first time either twin had held a championship in WWE.[62][63] Brie went on to successfully defend the championship against Kelly Kelly at Over the Limit, after switching places with Nikki.[64] On a special ""Power to the People"" episode of Raw on June 20, Brie defended her WWE Divas Championship against Kelly, who was selected by voters. Kelly then defeated Brie and won the championship. On July 17, Brie challenged Kelly for the championship in a rematch at Money in the Bank, but failed to win.[65]\n\nThe twins spent the majority of the rest of the year in tag team matches, regularly facing Kelly and Torres.[66][67] The Bellas began to show friction for the second time since joining WWE in March 2012, after both twins lost to AJ Lee in singles competition.[68][69] After Brie\'s match with Lee, Nikki revealed that Brie was rooting for Team Johnny in the 12-man tag team match at WrestleMania XXVIII, whilst Nikki was rooting for Team Teddy, thus furthering their dissension.[70]\n\nOn the April 6 episode of SmackDown, Nikki defeated the Divas Champion Beth Phoenix in a non-title match, after Kelly Kelly distracted Phoenix.[71] On April 23, Nikki defeated Phoenix in a lumberjill match on Raw to win the Divas Championship for the first time.[72][73] Brie lost Nikki\'s championship to Layla at Extreme Rules after Twin Magic failed, ending her Divas Championship reign after only a week.[74] The following night on Raw, they competed in their last match with the WWE, failing to win back the Divas Championship from Layla in a triple threat match.[75] Later that night, WWE announced on their website that the twins had been fired by Executive Administrator Eve Torres.[76]\n\nIndependent circuit promotions (2012\xe2\x80\x932013) [ edit ]\n\nOn May 1, 2012, the twins appeared at their first independent wrestling show in Newburgh, New York at Northeast Wrestling.[77][78] They later appeared for CTWE Pro Wrestling at the Season Beatings pay-per-view on December 15, each accompanying a different wrestler to the ring.\n\nReturn to WWE [ edit ]\n\nTotal Divas storylines (2013\xe2\x80\x932014) [ edit ]\n\nAfter returning to WWE, the twins began dressing in different outfits as seen here\n\nThe Bella Twins returned to WWE on the March 11, 2013, episode of Raw in a backstage segment with Team Rhodes Scholars (Cody Rhodes and Damien Sandow).[79] On the March 15 episode of SmackDown, the twins attacked The Funkadactyls (Cameron and Naomi),[80] and the following week interfered in matches between Team Rhodes Scholars and Brodus Clay and Tensai, but were attacked by The Funkadactyls.[81][82] The twins made their in-ring return facing and defeating The Funkadactyls on the March 27 episode of Main Event after interference from Cody Rhodes,[83] and also defeated them on Raw five days later.[84] The Bella Twins were scheduled to participate in an eight\xe2\x80\x93person tag team match with Team Rhodes Scholars against Tons of Funk (Clay and Tensai) and The Funkadactyls at WrestleMania 29, but the match was cancelled due to time restraints,[84] and instead took place the following night on Raw, where The Bella Twins and Team Rhodes Scollars were defeated.[85] The twins continued their feud with The Funkadactyls throughout April, defeating them in standard tag team,[86] and six-Diva tag team matches.[87][88] In June, Nikki suffered a fractured tibia.[89]\n\nUpon the debut of the Total Divas reality television program in July, The Bellas began feud with their co\xe2\x80\x93star on the show, Natalya. Brie and Natalya went on to trade victories in singles competition on Raw and at SummerSlam.[90][91][92] The cast of Total Divas then transitioned into a scripted feud with Divas Champion AJ Lee, who mocked the show and cast, turning The Bellas faces in the process.[92] At Night of Champions, Brie unsuccessfully challenged Lee for the Divas Championship in a four-way match, which also involved Natalya and Naomi.[93] Following Brie\'s real-life engagement to Daniel Bryan, their relationship began to be acknowledged on WWE television.[94] Continuing their feud into October, Brie and AJ Lee faced off at the Battleground and Hell in a Cell pay-per-views for the Divas Championship, but Brie was unsuccessful.[95][96] Nikki returned to in-ring action on the October 25 episode of SmackDown, losing to Lee.[97] At Survivor Series the following month, the twins were part of the victorious Team Total Divas.[98] The twins failed to win the Divas Championship again at WrestleMania XXX in the Divas Invitational match, which was won by AJ Lee.[99]\n\nBella in September 2014\n\nIn April 2014, Brie became involved in her real-life husband Daniel Bryan\'s ongoing storyline with Stephanie McMahon and Kane,[100] where as part of the storyline, McMahon threatened to fire Brie if an injured Bryan did not relinquish the WWE World Heavyweight Championship at Payback, which forced Brie to ""quit"" WWE before slapping McMahon in the face.[101] After Brie quit, McMahon put Nikki in several handicap matches as punishment.[102][103][104] After a month absence, Brie returned to WWE television, appearing in the crowd on July 21; following a confrontation, McMahon slapped Brie and was subsequently arrested.[105] In order to have Brie drop the ""charges"", Brie was rehired and received a match against McMahon at SummerSlam.[106]\n\nAt the pay-per-view, Nikki turned heel by attacking Brie, which allowed McMahon to win the match.[107] The next several weeks saw the twins fight in several backstage and in-ring segments, including a cameo appearance from Jerry Springer on Raw on September 8.[108] As part of the storyline, McMahon declared Nikki the face of the WWE Divas division and granted her a match at Night of Champions for the Divas Championship, which she failed to win.[109][110] Nikki then obtained permission to begin forcing Brie to compete in handicap matches, similar to her punishment at the hands of McMahon, although Brie was able to win them.[111][112] This led to a match between the twins at Hell in a Cell, where the loser was forced to become the winner\'s personal assistant for 30 days, in which Nikki defeated Brie.[113] Five days later on SmackDown, Nikki won a Halloween costume battle royal to become the number one contender for the Divas Championship.[114]\n\nTeam Bella (2014\xe2\x80\x932016) [ edit ]\n\nNikki received her title match against AJ Lee on November 23 at Survivor Series, which she won, with Brie\'s help, to become a two-time Divas Champion.[115] The duo had reconciled at this point, with Brie also turning heel in the process.[116][117][118] Nikki then went on to retain her championship in three separate occasions \xe2\x80\x93 against Lee in a rematch on December 14, at TLC: Tables, Ladders and Chairs,[119] against Naomi two days later on SmackDown,[120] and against Paige at Fastlane on February 22, 2015.[121] Paige and AJ then formed an alliance against the Bellas[122] which led to a tag team match at WrestleMania 31, where AJ and Paige were victorious.[123][124]\n\nOn April 26, after Nikki, with the help of Brie, once again retained her title against Naomi at Extreme Rules[125] a feud started, with Naomi aligning with the returning Tamina to even the odds against the Bellas, who began showing more heroic characteristics,[126][127] This change in character was criticized as ""sudden"", ""randomly"" and ""for no reason"".[128] This led to a tag team match between the two teams on May 17, at Payback, which Naomi and Tamina won.[129] Two weeks later, at Elimination Chamber, Nikki retained her title against Naomi and Paige in a triple threat match, with Brie banned from ringside.[130]\n\nIn June, The Bella Twins became villains once again by employing Twin Magic, which helped Nikki retain the title against Paige on the June 1 episode of Raw and at Money in the Bank.[131][132] During the feud with Paige, Alicia Fox allied with them to form Team Bella.[133] At The Beast in the East on July 4, Nikki retained the title against Paige and Tamina.[134] After weeks of Team Bella outnumbering Paige, Naomi, and Tamina, Stephanie McMahon called for a ""revolution"" in the WWE Divas division and introduced the debuting Charlotte and Becky Lynch as Paige\'s allies, while NXT Women\'s Champion Sasha Banks debuted as an ally to Naomi and Tamina, which led to a brawl between the three teams.[135][136] Nikki then lost to Charlotte in a tag team match on the August 3 episode of Raw,[137] and to Banks on the August 17 episode of Raw in a non-title match.[138] The three teams faced off on August 23 at SummerSlam in a three team elimination match, in which Team Bella first eliminated Team B.A.D., before Team PCB\'s win.[139]\n\nOn the September 14 episode of Raw, Nikki defended her title against Charlotte, who pinned Brie after the twins had switched places to win the match;

(Naomi and Tamina), Summer Rae and Emma, leading to a 10-Diva tag team match on the WrestleMania 32 kickoff show, which Team Total Divas would win after Naomi submitted to Brie.[155][156] Three days later on April 6, Brie confirmed that she would be taking an extended break from in-ring competition, citing family reasons, while also stating that she would continue working for WWE as an ambassador.[157]\n\nSporadic appearances (2018\xe2\x80\x93present) [ edit ]\n\nThe Bella Twins returned for the 25th anniversary of Raw on January 22, 2018.[158] Brie later returned to in-ring competition at Royal Rumble, entering at number 28 in the inaugural women\'s Royal Rumble match, one number after her sister Nikki, who would eliminate her from the match minutes later.\n\nAt SummerSlam, The Miz defeated Daniel Bryan after an interference from Miz\'s wife Maryse.[159] On the following SmackDown, Miz and Maryse came out, Miz then mocked Bryan\'s retirement speech two years earlier.

The scene combined visual special effects with some carefully-timed choreography to create the episode\xe2\x80\x99s most stunning tableau, even in a premiere crammed with visual delights.\n\nWhen I spoke with Bilquis herself, Yetide Badaki, at Comic-Con last summer, the actress described filming the scene with an excited gleam in her eye. As a lifelong fan of Neil Gaiman\xe2\x80\x99s work, she said she knew how important it was for her entrance to convey both tragedy and frightening divine power. During the Comic-Con panel earlier in the day, star Ricky Whittle joked that they had nicknamed Badaki\xe2\x80\x99s nether regions \xe2\x80\x9cJoy\xe2\x80\x9d during filming. When I got technical and asked her if the nickname was required because there was some kind of prosthetic involved in the scene, Badaki told me with a grin, \xe2\x80\x9cNo prosthetic. I think that you start to envision it in your mind, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you see Joy\xe2\x80\x94as far as I know.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThat scene\xe2\x80\x94which easily could have been cut\xe2\x80\x94belongs in both the show and the first chapter of Gaiman\xe2\x80\x99s novel for a very good reason. And, no, it\xe2\x80\x99s not so American Gods can win some unofficial sexual arms race with Game of Thrones and Outlander. What we learn in this scene is that a) gods are real, b) they are diminished in power (we see Bilquis looking slightly faded before she absorbs her victim), and c) they are willing to stoop to trickery to get the vitality they need from their worshippers. Essentially, in this scene, we are seeing a blueprint of what\xe2\x80\x99s to come in the show, all tied up in a very alluring crimson-hued package.\n\nFor those unfamiliar with every nook and cranny of myth and legend, Bilquis\xe2\x80\x94also called Bilqis or Balkis or Makeda\xe2\x80\x94was the legendarily beautiful and uncommonly wise Queen of Sheba. Legend has it she is at least half djinn (or genie). In both the Bible and the Koran, she meets with\xe2\x80\x94and is not outwitted by\xe2\x80\x94King Solomon of Israel. Bilquis doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have a massive role to play in the novel American Gods; she has this unforgettable scene and another, even more tragic one. But according to Badaki, the role has been expanded for the TV series. So be on the lookout for some more insane sexual encounters. Something tells me you won\xe2\x80\x99t miss them.'"

"b'Warning: Minor spoilers ahead for the second season of ""13 Reasons Why.""\n\nNetflix\'s hit series ""13 Reasons Why"" will return with a second season on May 18. The first season of this controversial series explored the suicide of high school student Hannah Baker and the impact of her choice on a small town community.\n\nHannah left behind 13 tapes explaining the precisely how various peers and adults had impacted her life and ultimately contributed to her choice to take her own life. There will be 13 new episodes on the second season, but no more cassette tapes this time around.\n\nAccording to the season two synopsis, polaroids will take the place of cassettes. Here\'s the full description:\n\n""Season 2 picks up in the aftermath of Hannah\'s death and the start of our characters\' complicated journeys toward healing and recovery. Liberty High prepares to go on trial, but someone will stop at nothing to keep the truth surrounding Hannah\xe2\x80\x99s death concealed. A series of ominous polaroids lead Clay and his classmates to uncover a sickening secret and a conspiracy to cover it up.""\n\nINSIDER is here to reveal everything we know so far about what\'s in store for ""13 Reasons Why."" Let\'s dive in.\n\nNew hints in the season two announcement video\n\nWhen Netflix shared a new teaser video announcing the May 18 release date, several clues about what\'s to come were contained inside.\n\nThe teaser showed Mr. Porter\'s desk with two files \xe2\x80\x94 one on Bryce and another on Tyler. Netflix\n\nIt looks like both Bryce and Tyler will be involved in investigations. The teaser showed us Bryce possibly drugging and assaulting another girl at a party, while a file on Tyler was sitting on the school counselor\'s desk.\n\nWe\'ll get into what this means for Tyler in a bit, but first here\'s more about what will happen with Bryce.\n\nA series of sexual assaults committed by athletic teams will be uncovered\n\nOn the first season, it\'s revealed that both Hannah and another student, Jessica, were raped by a fellow student and local sports-star named Bryce.\n\nHannah names Bryce as one of the reasons why she committed suicide, but Jessica (who is also on the tapes for other reasons) takes more time to come to terms with what happened with her. By the first season finale, Jessica had confronted her own substance abuse issues she was using as a coping mechanism for the trauma and had decided to open up to her dad about what happened to her.\n\n""Jessica\'s experience continues to be a central part of season two,"" Yorkey said during a recent Netflix panel. ""We wanted to look at her recovery and what it [means] to go from being a victim of sexual of sexual assault to being a survivor and what that journey is like.""\n\nJessica is still coming to terms with her assault. Beth Dubber/Netflix\n\n""We said from day one of season one in our writers\' room that we wanted this show to be about the way we treat girls and women in this culture, and the way we raise boys up into men,"" Yorkey said. ""In season two, we explore a storyline that has to do with an ongoing case of numerous sexual assaults that is connected to the athletic teams at Liberty High School.""\n\nThis new case will examine ""the ways sexual assault has been perpetrated [and documented] over a number of years"" within the athletic department and Liberty High School as a whole.\n\nYorkey says the parallel between this new storyline and the real-world #MeToo movement is happenstance.\n\n""We developed [it] many many months ago based on quite a bit of research we had done, but at the time we had these discussions about whether it was realistic to think serial sexual abuse could be kept secret by so many people for so long,"" Yorkey said. ""And then we watched events unfold in our culture that confirmed... unfortunately it is possible for severe sexual abuse at a very high and systematic level to be kept secret and for institutions to be complicit in it.""\n\nWhich of the other high school athletes has been assaulting women? Beth Dubber/Netflix\n\nThe community might help stop Tyler\'s school shooting plan\n\nThe first season of ""13 Reasons Why"" ended with the implication that Tyler Down, a Liberty High student who was bullied often, was planning an attack on his fellow students with a stash of guns and bullets hidden in his room.\n\nBut according to Yorkey, the community might reach out to Tyler in the ways it failed to do with Hannah. Maybe this is why Mr. Porter has a file on Tyler sitting on his desk in the new teaser.\n\n""One of the themes we\'ve talked about a lot for season two is the journey from isolation to finding community, and I think Tyler suffers \xe2\x80\x94 especially at the end of season one \xe2\x80\x94 from some severe social isolation,"" Yorkey told INSIDER.\n\nTyler had photographs of all the students who he thinks wronged him. Beth Dubber/Netflix\n\n""[Tyler is] thinking about making a tragic choice to restore to some sense of control or power,"" Yorkey said. ""And I think we\'ll see over the course of season two that he continued to struggle with that but that hopefully there will be a community that is able to support him in a way that maybe there wasn\'t for Hannah.""\n\nFor more on how this storyline might play out, read INSIDER\'s full interview with Yorkey and Netflix\'s vice president of original series.\n\nThe Bakers\' lawsuit against Hannah\'s school will go to trial\n\nBy the finale of the first season, Hannah Baker\'s parents, Olivia and Andrew, have brought a lawsuit against Liberty High School, holding it responsible for their daughter\'s death.\n\n""Hannah Baker\'s parents suing the school district is a central story engine to the whole season,"" showrunner Brian Yorkey told INSIDER. ""This question of whether and how the school was responsible for what happened to Hannah is a really interesting one.""\n\nHannah\'s parents are taking their case even further. Netflix\n\nMany of the students featured on Hannah\'s 13 tapes had been deposed already on the first season, but now we\'ll see them testify in an actual court. By the finale, Hannah\'s parents were finally in possession of the tapes themselves, which will surely be a key part of evidence in their case.\n\n""As we see that all play out, we also see these kids come to court and testify and tell these stories under oath,"" Yorkey said. ""Secrets are revealed and over the course of the season people will find that their opinion on who was complicit and who wasn\'t, and their opinions about Hannah, will go through a series of changes. Hopefully that will be a really interesting ride.""\n\nWhy we\'ll see a ""very different"" Hannah in flashbacks\n\n""13 Reasons Why"" star Katherine Langford (Hannah) made waves last year when she said the second season will show a ""very different"" version of her character. Since Hannah was already dead by the start of the first episode, all of her appearances were flashbacks narrated by either Hannah herself (on the tapes) or memories Clay and the other students had of her.\n\n""On season one, Hannah told her story. And in season two, the other kids get a chance to tell their stories,"" Yorkey told INSIDER. ""There\'s more to the story than what is on the tapes. And I think what we\'ll see [\xe2\x80\xa6] will certainly complicate our understanding of who Hannah was.""\n\nHannah\'s version of events might not have been entirely accurate. Netflix\n\n""I don\'t think it will lessen the tragedy of her death in any ways [and] it doesn\'t change any of what she went through,"" Yorkey said. ""But it provides a fuller picture of what her life was and also of the kids whose stories she tells \xe2\x80\x94 how they saw what happened between them and Hannah and what happened in the community.""\n\nYorkey hopes the fans of the series will understand why we might see new sides to Hannah on this coming second season.\n\n""That\'s an important part of season two\'s storytelling and I think it will be an interesting challenge, especially for younger viewers, to understand that Hannah\'s story was not the definitive story.""\n\nAs we noted, most of the flashbacks shown on the first season were portrayals of the events as Hannah was describing them on her tapes. This means we were hearing (and seeing) her side of the story.\n\n""She\'s not a reliable narrator and she didn\'t necessarily put everything on those tapes,"" Yorkey said. ""There\'s always more to the story.""\n\nDylan Minnette stars as Clay Jensen on ""13 Reasons Why.""

Another new adult in the mix will be the character of Sonya, a litigator who\'s likely part of the Bakers\' lawsuit.\n\nLastly, there\'s the Liberty High School baseball coach, Rick, who we\'re guessing will be wrapped up in the new revelation of serial sexual abuse connected to the athletic departments.\n\n(For a full rundown of the new faces you\'ll see on the second season, read INSIDER\'s report here).\n\nBryce is one of the serial sexual assaulters at Liberty High School.

"b'With fashion\'s big night kicking off in just a few hours, everyone has been wondering whether or not red carpet regulars Kim Kardashian and Kanye West would be attending the Met Gala together or not? Well, according to People and confirmed by her rep to Bustle, Kardashian will be in attendance, but she\'ll be walking the red carpet without West, who will reportedly be staying in home with the couple\'s children, North and Saint. Bustle has reached out to a rep for West for comment, but did not receive a response at the time of publication.\n\nWest and Kardashian first attended the Met Gala together in 2013 and were probably the most talked about attendees that year because of the internet\'s obsession with the floral print dress Kardashian wore. Each subsequent year the two have been side by side on the red carpet, so it\'s a little surprising that West won\'t be joining his wife for what many call the fashion event of the year.\n\n""Kanye West will not be attending the Met Ball,"" a source claimed to People. ""He\xe2\x80\x99ll be staying back in L.A. with their kids. Everything is great with him and Kim and he\xe2\x80\x99s supportive of her going solo."" Although she\'ll be walking the red carpet without her husband, Kardashian probably won\'t be going to the gala all by herself, as other members of her famous family are also said to be going to the event. Kendall Jenner\'s rep confirmed she is attending, and Just Jared reports that sister Kylie Jenner will also be there. (Kylie\'s rep had not yet responded to Bustle\'s request for comment at the time of publication.)\n\nMike Coppola/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images\n\nRemember it\'s only been a few month\'s since West\'s hospitalization for exhaustion, and the couple have scaled back significantly when it comes to red carpet appearances. As the source who spoke to People explained, West is ""still very much enjoying his time off from public events."" And rightfully so! West and his family have been through a lot in the past year, and he certainly shouldn\'t feel rushed to get back out there in front of cameras.\n\nThe theme of this year\'s exhibit is Rei Kawakubo/Comme des Gar\xc3\xa7ons: The Art of the In-Between, and pieces in the museum will be arranged by contrasting themes like East/West, male/female, and past/present, according to Vogue. According to People, Kardashian will be wearing a dressed designed by Vivienne Westwood, and although West won\'t be by her side, I\'m definitely looking forward to seeing Kardashian on the red carpet.'"
"b'This post contains plot details for the entirety of House of Cards Season 6.\n\nFor a show built on the premise that people will abandon their values at the slightest hint of personal gain, credit must be given to how swiftly House of Cards, offscreen, handled the growing number of accusations of sexual misconduct against its star Kevin Spacey last year. (Spacey has apologized to actor Anthony Rapp, and sought treatment in the wake of further allegations.) Production was suspended, and a few days later, Spacey was fired. Season 6 was announced to be the show\xe2\x80\x99s last. It was convenient that before Spacey\xe2\x80\x99s firing, Season 5 of House of Cards ended with Robin Wright\xe2\x80\x99s character Claire Underwood wresting control from her husband to become president of the United States, herself. \xe2\x80\x9cMy turn,\xe2\x80\x9d she says directly to the camera, in one of the most successful finale twists the show has pulled off. The flip became a moment of unexpected foreshadowing, both for the direction of the show and for the nationwide conversation on the continued struggle for gender equality. In Season 6, all eight episodes of which debuted today, Claire is the president, and Frank is just a memory\xe2\x80\x94much discussed, but never heard from or spoken to ever again. House of Cards won\xe2\x80\x99t even play his voice, which becomes increasingly obvious as Frank\xe2\x80\x99s old voice memos become a sought-after testament to Claire\xe2\x80\x99s awful character. In the time line, which picks up a couple of months after Claire\xe2\x80\x99s ascension, Frank is dead, but we don\xe2\x80\x99t know how or why.\n\nUnfortunately, though\xe2\x80\x94even with the leg up provided by the Season 5 finale, and the delayed release\xe2\x80\x94the production is unable to wrap up the story. I don\xe2\x80\x99t even mean that House of Cards doesn\xe2\x80\x99t end well, although it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t; I mean, there are multiple story lines that are simply abandoned. Wright is excellent\xe2\x80\x94she\xe2\x80\x99s doing her best work in this season, half-flirting with the audience as she scrambles to consolidate her position. In the sense that House of Cards transports the viewer to a fantasy of absolute, destructive power, Wright offers a window into a female version of it\xe2\x80\x94one that is markedly more elegant, as it is not suffused with Spacey\xe2\x80\x99s over-the-top Southern drawl.\n\nAs the show has reiterated since its debut, the power is still ugly\xe2\x80\x94thrilling, cathartic, and fulfilling a very human desire, yet still ugly. But Wright has inherited an impossible task. The story is trying to wrap up five seasons of action\xe2\x80\x94which includes the death of a half-dozen business-casual flunkies and several layers of Machiavellian manipulation. The story of Season 6 just doesn\xe2\x80\x99t cohere; it barely even tracks well enough to summarize. In a way, the total breakdown is sort of beautiful; it\xe2\x80\x99s like watching the story collapse in upon itself, a deserted building, carefully demolished.\n\nIn exchange for a plot arc, House of Cards relies on what it has always done best: cynical provocation. The most confusing is Claire\xe2\x80\x99s canny exploitation of feminist language for political gain, which in the back half of the season turns into a story about her in-office pregnancy. (It is never made clear how Claire gets pregnant; presumably, it could be her naturally conceived child with Frank, but the careful rollout of her condition suggests a much more calculated method.) Wright puts a lot into the movement of her face, but House of Cards has very little to offer on Claire\xe2\x80\x99s feelings about impending motherhood, or how being pregnant changes the environment of the White House. Midway through the season, Claire announces she\xe2\x80\x99s returning to her maiden name, Hale. She also lectures the Situation Room, during a nuclear crisis, on how no one knows the word for the opposite of misogyny. (Claire, apparently, was not paying much attention to the Internet in, like, 2013.)\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s not just Claire\xe2\x80\x99s story that spins out of control. Diane Lane and Greg Kinnear play the billionaire Shepherd siblings who are trying to use Claire to their advantage, and end up becoming her primary opponents; a combination of the Koch brothers and Facebook, their corporate holdings manage to mine data, pollute the environment, steal users\xe2\x80\x99 privacy, and uphold traditional family values. But even though the siblings make for a fascinating if grotesque portrait of power, privilege, and traditional family values, they barely have a story; like so much else in this season, the plot arc merely gestures toward relevance. Lane\xe2\x80\x99s character Annette, a friend of Claire\xe2\x80\x99s since girlhood, provides a striking foil for Claire\xe2\x80\x99s ascent. (In one flashback to the dorms at Andover, the two are shown mirroring each other in elaborate cotillion-style curtsies, while sharing a bitten-off joint. It\xe2\x80\x99s a loaded, arresting moment, but it\xe2\x80\x99s just that: a moment.)\n\nThe Shepherds amass all of the not-yet-dead pawns from the last five seasons of House of Cards on their team\xe2\x80\x94journalists working on hit pieces, operatives-turned-data miners, Russian plants in Claire\xe2\x80\x99s administration, Cabinet secretaries and Supreme Court justices that can be bought for the right price. By the end of the season, in what feels like a desperate attempt to tie up loose ends, nearly all of these characters are killed. (The list includes Patricia Clarkson\xe2\x80\x99s character Jane, Boris McGiver\xe2\x80\x99s Tom Hammerschmidt, and Jayne Atkinson\xe2\x80\x99s Cathy Durant, who technically dies twice.) The Shepherds get behind a Supreme Court ruling that would limit Claire\xe2\x80\x99s power, so to outmaneuver them President Hale dives into a heated conflict between ICO, the show\xe2\x80\x99s version of ISIS, and Russian President Viktor Petrov (Lars Mikkelsen), the show\xe2\x80\x99s version of Vladimir Putin. This brings the nation to the brink of nuclear war. And if this were not enough drama, Annette begins to coolly plan the president\xe2\x80\x99s assassination, with a cabal of co-conspirators that includes the vice president (Campbell Scott). Her man for the job? Doug Stamper (Michael Kelly), Frank Underwood\xe2\x80\x99s long-serving jack-of-all-trades.\n\nWhich leads to the final scene of the entire series. A face-off, between Claire and Doug, in the Oval Office. During which Stamper confesses to murdering Frank, somewhat by accident, by tampering with his medication\xe2\x80\x94and then lunges at Claire with Frank\xe2\x80\x99s letter opener. Claire adroitly turns it back on him, and then, as he bleeds, suffocates him. He does not resist. So Stamper dies, in a pool of blood, inches from the presidential seal on the carpet. And Claire\xe2\x80\x94almost 30 weeks pregnant, with an armed nuclear football awaiting her, and political chaos looming\xe2\x80\x94whispers, \xe2\x80\x9cNo more pain,\xe2\x80\x9d and then turns to the camera, with an almost crazed look in her eye.\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s a great shot. The camera looks up at Claire, almost as if we are lying next to Doug on the ground. Wright\xe2\x80\x99s blonde bob arcs toward the lens in a sweep. But it\xe2\x80\x99s a mysterious, ambiguous ending for a show that has, until now, specialized in rather blunt storytelling. With Stamper dead, is Claire poised to succeed? Doomed to fail? Confident in her purpose? Haunted by guilt? Is this her last murder, or a harbinger of future carnage? What about everything else\xe2\x80\x94the press secretary who knew too much (Kristen Sieh), the fearmongering journalist (Athena Karkanis), the conniving Speaker of the House (Boris Kodjoe)? What about the data mining that exposed the midterms to fraud, or the nuclear conflict in Syria? What about Claire\xe2\x80\x99s as-yet unnamed daughter, and Annette\xe2\x80\x99s thwarted assassination attempt? What about the story Janine (Constance Zimmer) had worked for so long to report? The story of House of Cards took Macbeth and Machiavelli and unleashed it on the White House; at its end, all it can show the audience is a moment of interpersonal bloodlust.\n\nHouse of Cards has always been a show that works best when in conversation with its political moment; the early years were so striking because their chilly cynicism was juxtaposed against the vivid optimism of President Barack Obama\xe2\x80\x99s administration. In the Trump era, its cynicism seems like piling on to what\xe2\x80\x99s already pernicious. The weekend before the real 2018 midterms, it\xe2\x80\x99s jarring to watch this show, where politicians plot to steal elections and sway Supreme Court justices with horrifying gusto. In this season, the story seems to be simply about power, and the dangers of it\xe2\x80\x94but for a show that so rewarded Frank Underwood\xe2\x80\x99s precise, brutal reign, it feels like a sharp detour.\n\nIn its way, this abrupt conclusion is a staggering commentary on what came before: the stakes of the Underwoods\xe2\x80\x99 House of Cards were global and political, but it could only lead to this kind of intimate, selfish violence. The rest of the story\xe2\x80\x94the world outside the Oval Office\xe2\x80\x94is abandoned midway. It\xe2\x80\x99s as if House of Cards is telling us the rest of the story must be written by us.'"

"b'Bryan has learned this season that it\xe2\x80\x99s better to ask forgiveness than permission. He never gets permission, but he always gets forgiven if his reckless behavior gets results. So in \xe2\x80\x9cI Surrender\xe2\x80\x9d Bryan goes AWOL after Mejia. In a series of quick leaps and bounds, Mejia, Asha, Bryan and the ODNI team end up on Mexico.\n\nWe open with ODNI being briefed on Asha\xe2\x80\x99s kidnapping. They finally know a little about Bryan\xe2\x80\x99s personal life. Then we see Bryan hitching a ride on backroads. The woman who picks him up, imagines herself a contestant on a tv talent show. She mistakes Bryan\xe2\x80\x99s explanation, \xe2\x80\x9cSomeone took my girlfriend,\xe2\x80\x9d as a melancholy Country/Western theme. (Here is another personality, like Leah, who we are instantly drawn to, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll never see again.)\n\nAs Bryan hitchhikes across country to stay off the grid, we need reminding of what Bryan is after, with an escape attempt by his damsel and a phone call.\n\nBryan then strong arms Mejia\xe2\x80\x99s business contacts to find out where Mejia might seek help. He then manipulates Mejia\xe2\x80\x99s ex-wife to give him information on the tunnels leading to Mexico.\n\nBryan is further delayed when Hart\xe2\x80\x99s team shows up and tries talking him down.\n\nEven though Bryan\xe2\x80\x99s journey would take longer than Mejia \xe2\x80\x93 who had a head start, had people helping him, and knew exactly where he was going \xe2\x80\x93 somehow Bryan ends up in the tunnel at the same time as Mejia.\n\nGranted, Asha\xe2\x80\x99s lackluster attempts at escaping may have eaten up two minutes of screen time, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it would make up for the difference in time Bryan would have needed to get in the tunnels at that exact moment.\n\nInside the tunnel Bryan shoots Elena, who falls into a wall. Apparently Elena\xe2\x80\x99s ninety-pound frame falling against the wall is enough to collapse the tunnel. The team then catches up to Bryan in the tunnels. In a speech involving more words than the writers have given Bryan since the pilot, Bryan insists he isn\xe2\x80\x99t coming back to ODNI. (Seriously, I\xe2\x80\x99d almost forgotten how good Clive Standen\xe2\x80\x99s American accent was because we rarely hear anything but, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m good.\xe2\x80\x9d) The team decides they\xe2\x80\x99ll help Bryan, even though they wanted to bring him in before the last commercial break.\n\nHart still doesn\xe2\x80\x99t completely trust Bryan\xe2\x80\x99s thinking, but Christina respects John\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, so she flip flops again.\n\nThey learn from Agent Salt of an illegal arms operation in Juarez, Mexico set up by the Deputy Director of the FBI. Discovering and procuring guns takes all of thirty seconds. And it takes another five seconds to determine Mejia\xe2\x80\x99s location. (Bryan at least forces his team to think on their toes and cut red tape this season. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t Hart say it took hundreds or thousands of man hours for these operations? This one took 35 seconds.)\n\nThe action is slowed to a crawl, as the team looks around corners, opens doors, and quietly takes out Mejia\xe2\x80\x99s bumbling guards. It may have created a realistic feel, to have us hearing the fiesta music in the background, but it made the scene even less suspenseful.\n\nAsha makes a run for it when Mejia learns of the authorities and shoots his cousin. He tells everyone they all betrayed him. The idea that Mejia would be betrayed, only comes from Mejia\xe2\x80\x99s rantings and a quick mention from Bryan earlier. The writers could have built up the betrayal, and some actual tension, with some spicy cat and mouse conversation over dinner in Mejia\xe2\x80\x99s court, instead of having us watch Asha attempt to simply walk out the front door. (smh)\n\nChaos ensues as the party breaks up. Asha stops in the kitchen when Mejia shoots. Then for some unknown reason, Mejia puts his gun away.\n\nThis allows Asha time to attack Mejia with a knife, instead of RUNNING. And since she has already proven to have none of Bryan\xe2\x80\x99s skills, Mejia wrestles the knife to her throat as Bryan arrives. Bryan watches as Mejia slices her throat telling Bryan, \xe2\x80\x9cYou choose. Me or her.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThis promised to be a great scene. I actually held my breath. Instead, Bryan has the option of leaving Asha in John\xe2\x80\x99s trusting hands. Bryan doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know if she will survive, but John scoops her up to an awaiting medivac, destroying any suspense for me. Bryan bumps into Mejia at the end of the line, both cornered by Mexican forces.\n\nAfter some tense staring, Bryan is triggered by Mejia\xe2\x80\x99s, \xe2\x80\x9cI surrender. Goodbye.\xe2\x80\x9d Bryan shoots Mejia clean in the head, and is shot himself, in his bullet proof vest. Bryan is taken by the Mexican authorities. The last scene is Bryan raising his head in a prison cell.\n\nThis was the season finale of an action series, yet the only action in this episode, is Bryan slamming into a car\xe2\x80\x99s windshield and hopping out of a ground level window \xe2\x80\x93 hopping \xe2\x80\x93 while being chased by a colleague who is of no threat to him WHATSOEVER. Asha by contrast had four failed escape scenes that lacked any suspense or drama.\n\nWill \xe2\x80\x98Taken\xe2\x80\x99 be renewed? For his sake I hope Bryan doesn\xe2\x80\x99t rot in television purgatory. My take on the season as a whole, is that it was different and exciting, but it lost its rhythm after the first few episodes. When Bryan tells the truck driver he \xe2\x80\x9ccan cook,\xe2\x80\x9d it underscores that we still know very little about his, or any character on the show. Some episodes were so fast paced that the audience couldn\xe2\x80\x99t breathe or follow the plot jumps. Lulls in action were filled with melodramatic pauses, the development of characters we never see again(at least we saw Salt again this week), or the reiteration of obvious storylines. Do the writers assume the audience is brain dead at 10pm? Granted many did tune in after two hours of a tv talent contest.\n\nIf \xe2\x80\x98Taken\xe2\x80\x99 is renewed, I hope a rewrite and better time slot are \xe2\x80\x9ctaken\xe2\x80\x9d into consideration.\n\nCatch up on the recaps for all of Season One of \xe2\x80\x98Taken\xe2\x80\x99 HERE!\n\npicture source: http://www.nbc.com\n\nComments\n\ncomments'"

"b'Kelly Ripa has settled on Ryan Seacrest as the new permanent co-host of her syndicated daily morning show, which as of today is renamed \xe2\x80\x9cLive with Kelly and Ryan.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRipa and Seacrest announced the surprise choice at the start of Monday\xe2\x80\x99s edition of the show, which Ripa has hosted since early 2001. Seacrest\xe2\x80\x99s move into the seat next to Ripa comes nearly a year after Ripa\xe2\x80\x99s former co-host, Michael Strahan, left the Disney-distributed show for an anchor slot on ABC\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cGood Morning America.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cRyan is a quintessential broadcaster and at the top of his game,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ripa in a statement. \xe2\x80\x9cI am thrilled to start my mornings with him every day, and we are so fortunate at \xe2\x80\x98Live\xe2\x80\x99 to have him join the family.

It\xe2\x80\x99s consistently been my privilege and pleasure to work alongside Kelly with all her incredible talents, charm and humor,\xe2\x80\x9d Seacrest said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been so fortunate in my career to be a part of some incredible TV programs, and I\xe2\x80\x99m excited to join daytime\xe2\x80\x99s top entertainment talk show, and most important, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t think of anyone I\xe2\x80\x99d rather share this new chapter with than Kelly Ripa \xe2\x80\x93 she\xe2\x80\x99s a dream broadcast partner, and I can\xe2\x80\x99t wait to start.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSeacrest served as a co-host with Ripa a few times during the past year, when \xe2\x80\x9cLive\xe2\x80\x9d had a steady stream of guest hosts while she took her time in selecting a permanent partner. His most recent stint on the show came on Feb. 27 with \xe2\x80\x9cLive\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x9d annual post-Oscars edition. Seacrest will continue in his role as host and executive producer of E!\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cLive From the Red Carpet\xe2\x80\x9d franchise, as well as his annual hosting gig on ABC\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cDick Clark\xe2\x80\x99s New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Rockin\xe2\x80\x99 Eve.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSeacrest\xe2\x80\x99s move to \xe2\x80\x9cLive\xe2\x80\x9d comes a year after the curtain fell on the show that made him a household name, Fox\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cAmerican Idol.\xe2\x80\x9d Over the years Seacrest has parlayed his success on air into a business empire that includes everything from investments in digital media startups (including DigiTour Media, Pinterest) and marketing/PR firms (Civic Entertainment Group) to a menswear line with Macy\xe2\x80\x99s and an upcoming line of skincare products, Polished by Dr. Lancer.\n\nRyan Seacrest Productions (RSP) is also a busy producer of scripted and unscripted TV series, notably E\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cKeeping Up with the Kardashians\xe2\x80\x9d and its many spinoffs, Bravo\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cShahs of Sunset\xe2\x80\x9d and the NBC drama series \xe2\x80\x9cShades of Blue,\xe2\x80\x9d toplined by Jennifer Lopez. RSP will remain based in Los Angeles. The \xe2\x80\x9cLive\xe2\x80\x9d gig puts Seacrest squarely in business with each of the Big Four network parent companies. In addition to his deal with NBCUniversal\xe2\x80\x99s E!, RSP has an unscripted TV production pact with Fox\xe2\x80\x99s Endemol Shine North America and a scripted TV development deal with CBS Television Studios.\n\nMichael Gelman, the longtime exec producer of \xe2\x80\x9cLive,\xe2\x80\x9d called Seacrest \xe2\x80\x9ca master of live TV\xe2\x80\x9d with the experience and chops to handle chores of daily morning TV.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you combine those attributes with the talents and experience of the incomparable Kelly Ripa, you have two skilled and entertaining broadcasters, with great chemistry. Add in an experienced production team and a successful 30-year franchise and you have the perfect combination,\xe2\x80\x9d Gelman said.\n\nGetting Seacrest in place is a bookend to the drama that ensued after Strahan made his move to \xe2\x80\x9cGMA,\xe2\x80\x9d which angered Ripa as she was left out of the loop on the planning. The show that bowed in the late 1980s with Regis Philbin and Kathie Lee Gifford at the helm has maintained its strong ratings during the past year thanks to Ripa. Seacrest\xe2\x80\x99s high-profile in TV and visibility in other media can only be an asset to \xe2\x80\x9cLive.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne of the secrets to \xe2\x80\x98Live\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x99 decades of success in daytime is the relatability of our hosts and their ability to deeply connect with the audience,\xe2\x80\x9d said Janice Marinelli, president of Disney/ABC Home Entertainment and TV Distribution. \xe2\x80\x9cRyan has a charm and charisma that resonate with his devoted TV and radio audiences, and together, he and the remarkable Kelly Ripa will take \xe2\x80\x98Live\xe2\x80\x99 to a whole new level.\xe2\x80\x9d'"

"b'On December 26, 1996, a little more than a year after O.J. Simpson was acquitted of killing his ex-wife Nicole and her friend Ron Goldman, six-year-old beauty queen JonBenet Ramsey was found murdered in the basement of her family\xe2\x80\x99s home in Boulder, Colorado. By that point, Dateline NBC correspondent Josh Mankiewicz says, \xe2\x80\x9cthe criminal justice system had become, for some people, a spectator sport, and the machinery that had ramped up under O. J. went straight to Boulder.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTwenty years later, in a culture still jonesing for true-crime narratives (The Jinx, Mommy Dead and Dearest), the Ramsey murder has undergone a second round of scrutiny, once again in tandem with the Simpson case. If the first half of 2016 belonged to ESPN\xe2\x80\x99s Oscar-winning documentary, O. J.: Made in America, and FX\xe2\x80\x99s dramatic miniseries The People v. O. J. Simpson, the second saw six projects that revisited the still-unsolved Ramsey case\xe2\x80\x94including a three-part Dr. Phil special featuring JonBenet\xe2\x80\x99s brother, Burke Ramsey, and Mankiewicz\xe2\x80\x99s investigative Dateline report, \xe2\x80\x9cWho Killed JonBenet?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nA seventh project, the documentary Casting JonBenet, premiered on Netflix and in select theaters in late April. Directed by Kitty Green, a 32-year-old from Melbourne, Australia, it is a fascinating coda to its predecessors. If any of the projects wins awards, it\xe2\x80\x99ll be this one.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s weirder than Twin Peaks in a lot of ways,\xe2\x80\x9d Green says of the case, which does bear some parallels to the David Lynch TV series. Green took a highly unconventional approach to the story, interviewing more than 200 Coloradans who auditioned, via an open casting call, to play members of the Ramsey family and others involved in the saga. Those who end up on-screen inevitably interpret the whodunit theories through their own experiences and traumas, revealing the dark secrets behind picturesque small-town life. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s always somebody you know,\xe2\x80\x9d says one woman auditioning for the part of Patsy Ramsey, JonBenet\xe2\x80\x99s mother, before revealing that a man she knew attempted to molest her when she was six. Another auditioner, trying out for a cop role, reveals that he is a sex educator and ends up demonstrating S&M floggers on camera.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAmericans love to talk,\xe2\x80\x9d says Green, who, while remaining respectful of her subjects, has some fun with our national need to overshare. \xe2\x80\x9cEveryone let their guard down and were willing to be vulnerable with me,\xe2\x80\x9d she says, adding, \xe2\x80\x9cThere is no way I could have made that film in Australia.\xe2\x80\x9d'"

"b'If Sean Penn could offer up one piece of universal advice, it would probably be \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t believe everything you read.\xe2\x80\x99\n\nIf you assumed this was in reference to how he\xe2\x80\x99s portrayed in the press, you\xe2\x80\x99d be partially correct. It\xe2\x80\x99s more than that though: the award-winning humanitarian and two-time Oscar-winning actor would also be alluding to the public perception of Haiti, a place he has personally invested his time and finances in, and his attention to, for the past six years. After an earthquake ravaged the Caribbean country in 2010, he founded J/P Haitian Relief Organization (HRO), which began as an emergency relief organization of 32 Americans. It has since expanded to a rank of nearly 200\xe2\x80\x94most of whom are Haitian\xe2\x80\x94with a goal of turning over the previously-built medical, educational and community development centers entirely to the Haitian people. Despite all the progress he\xe2\x80\x99s made, the country is far from escaping its reputation as the poorest country in the western hemisphere, but Penn won\xe2\x80\x99t bow out until the job is done. \xe2\x80\x9cThere was a commitment that we made to the country, and it\xe2\x80\x99s just unfinished business, I suppose. That\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99re still here.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt that the 56-year-old icon has done\xe2\x80\x94and continues to do\xe2\x80\x94more than his part to help Haiti escape its vicious cycle of poverty and insecurity. However, the country\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98Open for Business\xe2\x80\x99 slogan isn\xe2\x80\x99t even close to being true right now, especially in the wake of the damage Hurricane Matthew inflicted upon the country\xe2\x80\x99s southern region, destroying several villages and killing more than 800 people. Penn, however, places blame on more than Mother Nature. \xe2\x80\x9c[Haiti] has been very close to staying open for business, and then it gets thrown back for two main reasons.\xe2\x80\x9d He notes that one is because the country\xe2\x80\x99s leaders and its wealthy residents seem to be overinvested in the comfort zone of a system that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t allow for export, and demands that the country \xe2\x80\x9cbe a slave to the poor.\xe2\x80\x9d The other, more pressing problem in his eyes is the media: \xe2\x80\x9c[Members of the press have] been so incredibly irresponsible and uninformed in their reporting on Haiti, politically,\xe2\x80\x9d he says, adding, \xe2\x80\x9cI think that a four-day visit is a lot more damaging than no visit at all. There\xe2\x80\x99s kind of an impatience with understanding culturally [and politically] what goes on.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThough he isn\xe2\x80\x99t a fan of media in general, he\xe2\x80\x99s quick to praise Anthony Bourdain\xe2\x80\x99s early coverage of the nation on his food and travel reality show, No Reservations. The celebrity chef and TV personality turned what could have been a frothy segment on Haiti\xe2\x80\x99s cuisine and culture into an insightful look at its 2011 climate. Penn filmed a small segment for the series and, after it aired, took himself out for a meal in the nation\xe2\x80\x99s capital, Port-au-Prince. \xe2\x80\x9cI remember going into a restaurant that night and people had seen [the piece]. Everyone was saying, \xe2\x80\x98Finally, somebody got Haiti,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d he recalls.\n\nSomebody besides him, that is to say. Because what started off for Penn as a two-week trip to \xe2\x80\x9clend a hand\xe2\x80\x9d distributing pain medications like morphine and ketamine to trauma centers turned into a nine-month pilgrimage. Bottom line: he wanted to do some good, and he wanted to be close enough to his daughter Dylan and son Hopper that, if something serious happened back home in Los Angeles, he\xe2\x80\x99d be a quick plane ride away from the US. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, some might say, \xe2\x80\x98Well, why not stick to the United States [if you want to do some good]?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d he notes. \xe2\x80\x9cIt really just happened this way: once I got to Haiti, like so many other people, I fell in love with it\xe2\x80\x94the people there, the possibilities that is has.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe also believes that the United States has a \xe2\x80\x9csacred debt\xe2\x80\x9d to the Haitians in order to correct some of the mistakes it made in the past\xe2\x80\x94a debt owed, if you will\xe2\x80\x94and that it really pays to get the country out of trouble for the first time and help provide secure footing. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not going to be an overnight process\xe2\x80\x94nobody ever said it would be\xe2\x80\x94but I think that the people are ready to take care of themselves, and that\xe2\x80\x99s when things change.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd change it will be a-coming in a very, very big way. In August, Penn and J/P HRO announced their participation in Haiti Takes Root, an ambitious, long-term commitment from both the Haitian and French governments, as well as billionaire Sean Parker via The Parker Foundation. The ten-year, $300 million initiative seeks to repair the country from within by increasing technical expertise and strengthening environmental governance. The goal is to improve government relations and both ecotourism and environmental legislation. Needless to say, it\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty ambitious undertaking, but Penn and his pals are up to the challenge.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA powerful consortium of commitments have been made from the French government, to the Haitian government, to many international NGOs, and of course the Parker Foundation,\xe2\x80\x9d he says of the collaboration. \xe2\x80\x9c[Sean Parker] signed on as the piper. He\xe2\x80\x99s an extremely generous philanthropist and I knock wood that things are going well for him [in his other philanthropic ventures, including The Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy] because he\xe2\x80\x99s really bold. He is a disrupter and I love him.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nOne might say that Penn is somewhat of a disrupter himself\xe2\x80\x94though, quite humbly, he dismisses the praise. \xe2\x80\x9c[The initiative] hasn\xe2\x80\x99t seemed to be disruptive yet, but I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten people coming on board who have mutual concerns and a lot of support [for the cause].\xe2\x80\x9d He pauses a beat, and seems to be almost speaking to himself when he says, \xe2\x80\x9cThe only thing is that we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to get it right.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nEconomically, the country is in severe need of agro-reforestation but, luckily, Penn is up for the challenge. He\xe2\x80\x99s got big plans for Haiti\xe2\x80\x94including a complete restructure of the country\xe2\x80\x99s landscape to enhance its value as an ecotourism destination. That said, he realizes that they need to keep it simple to start with. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t forget to have exportable produce, but you have to have good roads first because, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t, the produce is going to get bruised all the way to the market. There are a lot of pieces to this puzzle and it\xe2\x80\x99s going to take a lot of investment.\xe2\x80\x9d He adds, \xe2\x80\x9cIf I\xe2\x80\x99m talking to the people of the United States of America, [I\xe2\x80\x99d say that] we have made a tremendous investment and we have to finish it. It\xe2\x80\x99s a call to humanity, it\xe2\x80\x99s a call on behalf of our neighbor, to pick a country up out of poverty and put it [in a position to feel] pride. That\xe2\x80\x99s the call to action.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nREBELING AGAINST ADVICE + PARTY PLANNING FOR A CAUSE\n\nThe best advice Sean Penn could offer, for the record, isn\xe2\x80\x99t the same thing as the best advice he\xe2\x80\x99s ever been given\xe2\x80\x94advice which, in his true contrary fashion, also happens to be the best advice he didn\xe2\x80\x99t take.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c[Someone told me,] \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t stay more than three months in a disaster zone without taking a couple of weeks off.\xe2\x80\x9d But, no, Penn didn\xe2\x80\x99t take a few weeks off, or even just stay for a few months\xe2\x80\x94he stayed for nine\xe2\x80\xa6 months\xe2\x80\xa6 straight. \xe2\x80\x9cI made the mistake of not taking that advice,\xe2\x80\x9d he admits with a rueful smile. \xe2\x80\x9cI think I went a little kooky.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nJust chalk it up to part of his charm. However, by living in Haiti for so long, he got to know the people\xe2\x80\x94the rich and the poor, the women and men, the rural and urban dwellers. He educated himself, he listened, and he learned. \xe2\x80\x9c[Once you] start to get a feel for the place, [you] know you\xe2\x80\x99ll never really know the place,\xe2\x80\x9d he shares. \xe2\x80\x9c[You] know that you\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to use your best instinct[s] about who to trust, who to learn from, who to question, and who to challenge and be challenged by. It\xe2\x80\x99s a long process, but we\xe2\x80\x99ve had a lot of success.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPart of the reason for that success is that he was able to let go, to delegate, to cede control. \xe2\x80\x9cAt a certain point, I stopped calling the shots,\xe2\x80\x9d he explains. \xe2\x80\x9cI had shot-callers that were living the life, that were Haitian. Like anything else, I had to develop good relationships and trust them.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTrust isn\xe2\x80\x99t something Penn gives easily or quickly, but something he chooses pragmatically, at least in his business dealings. As the evidence of Haiti Takes Root should convey, he\xe2\x80\x99s a \xe2\x80\x98big picture\xe2\x80\x99 kind of guy. He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have time to sweat the small stuff; he needed to build a team on the ground who cared.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI always joke around because here I have a lot of young volunteers who are definitely what you\xe2\x80\x99d call humanitarians. The daily compassion, weeping at deaths of everybody who had died; I just had no time to do that.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThis doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean Penn is unfeeling, or cold, or whatever else you would want to call him: his passion for Haiti and its people is genuine. In fact, he cares so much that he almost seems to go into another zone when talking about his work there. The intensity you often see him portray onscreen is 100 percent real. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m a facilitator, so I\xe2\x80\x99m not inclined to get to know everybody intimately,\xe2\x80\x9d he admits, adding, \xe2\x80\x9cI wanted to have a T-shirt that said, \xe2\x80\x98Tell it to the humanitarian.\xe2\x80\x99\n\nThe smirk with which he delivers this piece of bluster is pure Penn. True, he might not always be warm and fuzzy, but there\xe2\x80\x99s no disputing the fact that this guy is the very embodiment of a philanthropist. In fact, the Oxford English Dictionary describes a humanitarian as \xe2\x80\x9ca person who seeks to promote human welfare.\xe2\x80\x9d Sorry, Seany, but you fit the bill.\n\nSeriously though, one of his best \xe2\x80\x98big picture\xe2\x80\x99 ideas is to bring people together with music. Each year, guests know they\xe2\x80\x99re in for some world-class entertainment at J/P HRO\xe2\x80\x99s annual charity gala, Help Haiti Home. This is in addition to the ethereally-decorated room, a gourmet dinner, star-studded crowd with wall-to-wall celebrities such as Johnny Depp, Chris Hemsworth and Gwyneth Paltrow and big-name philanthropists like Marc Benioff and Sean Parker, as well as the be-all, end-all of auctions with items up for grabs from masters like Banksy and Jeff Koons.\n\nSome might say that Penn has the cushiest gig while putting together the gala: his sole involvement is being the guy who picks the band. And, when you\xe2\x80\x99re friends with some of the biggest icons in entertainment, that\xe2\x80\x99s not hard\xe2\x80\x94which is why everyone from Coldplay\xe2\x80\x99s Chris Martin and the Red Hot Chili Peppers to U2 and even ex-wife Madonna has performed. Never mind that his event competes with all the hoopla of Golden Globes week\xe2\x80\x94he has built it, and Penn\xe2\x80\x99s disciples do come.\n\nWhile he can\xe2\x80\x99t reveal who this year\xe2\x80\x99s entertainment will be, he informs us that the gala\xe2\x80\x94which will take place on January 7\xe2\x80\x94has been renamed Haiti Rising, mostly because Haiti is figuratively in a different place now. Since its relocations mandate has been achieved and the country is looking towards its next chapter, the gala\xe2\x80\x99s name is meant to convey its progress.\n\nStrategically, its moniker will also reflect the still-pressing need for financial contributions. Its word tense is telling, after all: it is a country on the rise, but it has not yet peaked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe needs are different, the resources\xe2\x80\x94or lack of thereof\xe2\x80\x94are different,\xe2\x80\x9d Penn says. \xe2\x80\x9cPeople have to understand that, [although Haiti faded from] the headlines, there\xe2\x80\x99s not big government grants going out there. You might have gotten a lot of your sectors financed on a multi-million dollar grant in the first couple of years after the earthquake, but it\xe2\x80\x99s almost entirely dried up. Everything we do is from private donations at this stage.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThose donations are in dire need this year, and the reason isn\xe2\x80\x99t one that Penn is pleased about. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s been a change and it isn\xe2\x80\x99t good news,\xe2\x80\x9d he notes grimly. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve said every year at the event, \xe2\x80\x98Come. Come see Haiti.\xe2\x80\x99 I knew that I could say that and people would be safe\xe2\x80\xa6 but I can\xe2\x80\x99t say that this year.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve had many foreigners killed, shot and kidnapped,\xe2\x80\x9d he continues quietly. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of political instability. Now, that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean you can\xe2\x80\x99t be safe again in Haiti. Of course I feel safe there. But, at large, I would not be someone to recommend it right now, and that\xe2\x80\x99s a terrible thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe\xe2\x80\x99s confident that things will improve but, again, it will take time\xe2\x80\xa6 and finances. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s going to change, it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be OK, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not off the hook,\xe2\x80\x9d he notes, adding that he and his team are hell-bent on raising funds for Haiti.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re saying, \xe2\x80\x98Look. Here\xe2\x80\x99s the value of what we\xe2\x80\x99ve been doing, and here\xe2\x80\x99s the color of change in that now. Here\xe2\x80\x99s what we need now that\xe2\x80\x99s different [from our former needs]. Here\xe2\x80\x99s what we want to celebrate that\xe2\x80\x99s different. I just told you a piece of bad news, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not all bad.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHis goal is to make everyone see the good in his cause, and his star-studded, sold-out event attended by some of the richest and most famous people in the world is the perfect platform. \xe2\x80\x9cI know how much we need to raise every year and [if we don\xe2\x80\x99t raise it], people are going to pay a huge price in Haiti. I feel a lot of pressure, but, knock wood, we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to have great support.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIf he had one gripe it\xe2\x80\x99s that, in his opinion, the same ten people are the ones giving over and over again. Sure, in 2015 and 2016, Help Haiti Home raised $6 million and $7 million, respectively, but it baffles Penn that, among a crowd that has so much, most seem to give so little.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are a few extraordinary people that come, but then you have a room that is full mostly of people that are not giving anything. They eat, stargaze and watch the band but, honestly, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99s a person in that room that can\xe2\x80\x99t afford $25. I always wonder about that.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHAITI IS THE FOCUS, BUT HOLLYWOOD IS STILL THERE\n\nThroughout his career, Penn has been called many things\xe2\x80\x94not all of which were positive. But, then, this is Hollywood in the digital age. Everyone\xe2\x80\x99s a critic.\n\nIf we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about the good stuff\xe2\x80\x94and we are\xe2\x80\x94there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot. His humanitarianism is the most obvious. In addition to his work with Haiti, he was fully hands-on in the relief effort post-Hurricane Katrina. He\xe2\x80\x99s received several substantial honors, including being named Ambassador at Large for Haiti in 2012 and being presented with the 2012 Peace Summit Award at the 12th World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates.\n\nBut Penn, a longtime activist and promoter of civil rights, has always been one to stand up for his beliefs. In 2002, he penned a prescient open letter, published in The Washington Post and The New York Times, to President George W. Bush against the planned invasion of Iraq. Furthermore, he traveled to Baghdad and Tehran in 2002 and 2003 to report for the San Francisco Chronicle. He has interviewed Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez and Cuba\xe2\x80\x99s President Raul Castro for The Nation, the latter of which was Castro\xe2\x80\x99s first-ever interview with a foreign journalist. In 2013, Penn also played a vital role in getting wrongfully imprisoned American entrepreneur Jacob Ostreicher released from a Bolivian prison, for which he was honored by the Aleph Institute in 2015. Plus, no one can forget his most recent effort, a secret interview for Rolling Stone with Mexican drug lord Joaquin \xe2\x80\x98El Chapo\xe2\x80\x99 Guzman.\n\nThis is a guy you can peel like an onion, layer after layer after layer. And, yes, he\xe2\x80\x99s still the Hollywood icon\xe2\x80\x94a five-time Academy Award-nominated actor, taking home the coveted Best Actor trophies for Clint Eastwood\xe2\x80\x99s Mystic River in 2004 and Gus Van Sant\xe2\x80\x99s Milk in 2009, who has also directed five feature films, including the critically-acclaimed Into the Wild, Indian Runner and The Pledge. (And those are just the highlights; it would actually take pages to cover all that Penn has done since he began his career with the 1981 film, Taps.) This fall, he begins shooting The Professor and the Madman, directed by Farhad Safinia\xe2\x80\x94another unprecedented first, given that this film allows him to star alongside Mel Gibson. The two have been talking about doing the film, which is based on Simon Winchester\xe2\x80\x99s 1998 book of the same name, for 12 years. Penn will play \xe2\x80\x98Madman\xe2\x80\x99 Dr. W.C. Minor in this true story of the creation of the Oxford English Dictionary, a man who submitted more than 10,000 entries to the project as an inmate at an asylum for the criminally insane to Gibson\xe2\x80\x99s OED founder, Professor James Murray.\n\nThough there\xe2\x80\x99s been a lot of hype and discussion about the project, Penn is keeping mum. \xe2\x80\x9cWe just didn\xe2\x80\x99t [work together before],\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know why. [But I took the role because] it\xe2\x80\x99s a great project, I get to work with Mel and it\xe2\x80\x99s a beautifully written script.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe\xe2\x80\x99s far more vocal on his thoughts regarding the upcoming presidential election, expressing his preference to Stephen Colbert on The Late Show: \xe2\x80\x9cEither you can [\xe2\x80\xa6] go out and vote in a very big way for someone like Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x94who you can then challenge and support, which is the only way that a president can have any success\xe2\x80\x94and you stick it out for four years,\xe2\x80\x9d he says, \xe2\x80\x9cOr we can just masturbate our way into hell with a guy who looks like the only blonde magician.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWhile his opinionated vote isn\xe2\x80\x99t surprising, Penn is a man whose overall actions still are. He uncharacteristically showed up to present at the pop-centric iHeartRadio Music Festival in Las Vegas this September, then popped up on several talk shows out of the blue to tout a free audiobook, Bob Honey Who Just Do Stuff, by a mysterious author named Pappy Pariah\xe2\x80\x94who may or may not be Penn himself in disguise. The point is, he might be a humanitarian and award-winning actor, but he\xe2\x80\x99s still a rebel and all-around badass who does exactly what he wants for reasons that, though they might not make sense to others, always, always have a purpose for Penn.\n\nBut has one facet of his personality hurt another? Has his \xe2\x80\x98rebel without a cause\xe2\x80\x99 persona of the past harmed the actual present-day rebel with one? Penn doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know and, quite frankly, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t care. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t read anything about myself in current tense, but I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of stuff,\xe2\x80\x9d he admits. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m aware of extremes. I\xe2\x80\x99m always surprised by anything very positive or anything very negative.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can imagine, based on things I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard about myself, that nobody would show up at [my] damn event because of my involvement, you know?\xe2\x80\x9d he continues. \xe2\x80\x9cI can imagine that and, yet, people come out. I put one foot in front of the other, and it is what it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWhile the jury\xe2\x80\x99s still out on whether public perception has helped or hurt him, his celebrity status has only benefitted his cause. What\xe2\x80\x99s more, he feels it\xe2\x80\x99s a civic duty to affect change if you have the platform to stand on. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you\xe2\x80\x99re in the acting or film business, where your major job is to share things, then you ought not to be [in the business] if you don\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d he says.\n\nStill, truth be told, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t really dig the \xe2\x80\x98philanthropist\xe2\x80\x99 label\xe2\x80\x94or any label, for that matter. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all just one thing,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s every day, putting your feet in your pants. It\xe2\x80\x99s acting and working in Haiti. It all feels like, for me, the same job. It\xe2\x80\x99s a really lucky life and a really fortunate one, but it\xe2\x80\x99s all just life to me.\xe2\x80\x9d'"
"b""If there's anyone that knows how to make a sartorial statement, it the Kardashian-Jenner family. Whether they're walking down the street or stepping onto the red carpet, these women always look great. And this time is no different. Kendall Jenner wore a crystal dress to the 2017 Met Gala. As in, it was made out of nothing but 85,000 crystals. It comes as no surprise that she nailed yet another red carpet ensemble, but this might just be her most unconventional look yet.\n\nThe model typically sticks to cutouts on the Met Gala red carpet. It seems like every year the cutouts get more and more intricate too. But, with this year's theme being Rei Kawakubo \xe2\x80\x94 aka all about the fabric \xe2\x80\x94 Jenner amped up her look to do the exact opposite. She stepped onto the red carpet in a La Perla Haute Couture Collection gown designed by Creative Director Julia Haart that was made but nothing but 85,000 hand painted and placed crystals. Basically, it's the chicest net you'll ever see walk the red carpet.\n\nJenner kept the rest of the look simple. Because when you're wearing nothing but accessories, you don't need to wear any. This look is definitely a piece of art to say the least. But don't just take me word for it. Here's the full head-to-toe look, so you can take it all in.\n\nNeilson Barnard/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images\n\nThis entire dress was one big accessory! It doesn't get more gorgeous than that.\n\nTheo Wargo/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images\n\nJenner can rock anything, and she wears this crystalized dress like a pro.\n\nTheo Wargo/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images\n\nBecause clothing is overrated."""

"b'At the 2017 Met Gala, the clothing spoke louder than the Instagram likes\n\nCara Kelly | USA TODAY\n\nShow Caption Hide Caption Extreme, eye-popping fashion reigns at Met Gala Entertainment Editor Cara Kelly and Digital Editor Maeve McDermott talk about the hottest fashion at the 2017 Met Gala.\n\nNEW YORK \xe2\x80\x94 Rei Kawakubo skittered up the stairs of the Metropolitan Museum of Art Monday night, only faintly glancing at the photographers and reporters chanting her name from the sides of the red, or rather, blue carpet. A stranger to the scene would have hardly known she was an important guest at the A-list circus that is the annual Costume Institute Gala, let alone the star of the whole show.\n\nThe reclusive designer, who founded label Comme des Gar\xc3\xa7ons in 1969, is the focus of the museum\xe2\x80\x99s latest exhibit and a rare bird in an industry full of peacocks. She scarcely gives interviews, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have personal social media accounts and won\xe2\x80\x99t measure her success on praise from others.\n\nHer designs speak for themselves. And in that way, her ethos was the unifier of a disparate and relatively quiet blue carpet.\n\nGuests to the yearly fundraiser held in honor of the exhibit are encouraged to channel the subject of the new showcase, which typically happens with varying degrees of success. The attendees who best hit Monday\'s theme \xe2\x80\x94 channeling Kawakubo through her own creations or by working with another designer in attendance \xe2\x80\x94 made their way up the steps of the Met without much fuss. Helen Lasichanh, the wife of co-host Pharrell Williams, hit the carpet early in a look from one of Kawakubo\xe2\x80\x99s most recent collections which experimented with silhouettes and bound the body without armholes. Like Kawakubo, she barely spoke to waiting reporters, because when wearing an outfit like that, what\xe2\x80\x99s left to say?\n\nPharrell, also in pieces from the designer, focused on his love of the brand when speaking with reporters.\n\n""What I feel is lucky and blessed to be able to do it, because its one of my heros,"" he said of co-hosting the night. ""Rei Kawakubo is the best of the best. Comme des Gar\xc3\xa7ons is one of my favorite brands.""\n\nRihanna climbed towards the Met entrance in another bulbous Comme des Gar\xc3\xa7ons creation, and like Lasichanh, let what she was wearing do the communicating. Fans screamed but the Barbadian singer and fashionista kept mostly silent behind the blossoming, 3-D petals.\n\nWait, what did they wear to the Met Gala? And the nominees for worst dressed at the 2017 Met Gala are\xe2\x80\xa6\n\nBlack-ish\xe2\x80\x99s Tracee Ellis Ross demurely acknowledged her cocoon-dress was also made by Comme des Gar\xc3\xa7ons before striding inside, no time for interviews, her wrangler told waiting reporters.\n\nKaty Perry solemnly processed in a straight line to the museum\'s door, dragging her lengthy red Maison Margiela train and veil behind her.\n\nOthers likewise had success channeling the avant-garde dress code without wearing the band tee-shirt to the concert. Priyanka Chopra and Ralph Lauren had a clever play on Kawakubo\'s legacy.\n\n""Everything that comes out of her is so androgynous and has no lines as far as gender, and this was sort of that,"" Chopra said. ""A trench gown.""\n\nOthers were at least drawn out of their comfort zones. Claire Foy in Erdem, Candice Swanepoel in Topshop and Kate Bosworth in Tory Burch were among the many guests to say their ensembles for the evening were the most over-the-top they\'d ever worn.\n\nBut if their choices spoke for themselves, so too did the starlets whose clothes alluded to the fact that they missed the entire concept.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI work around the figure, but I am never limited by what the figure has to be,\xe2\x80\x9d Kawakubo says in the guide to her exhibition.\n\nSo what would she think of the now-exhausted naked dress trend that showed up again on the likes of Kendall Jenner? One can only imagine she\xe2\x80\x99d find the unfaltering obsession with figure-baring outfits to be limiting.

"b'There is absolutely nothing good or right with this new creation from McDonald\xe2\x80\x99s.\n\nMcDonald\'s just unveiled its new invention: the ""Frork,"" a fork made of French fries https://t.co/oc6goZ9PW9 pic.twitter.com/HKKvhcdisU \xe2\x80\x94 NBC News (@NBCNews) May 1, 2017\n\nThe fast-food promotion is one of the greatest cultural gifts America gave the world. Most of us don\xe2\x80\x99t get to experience what seasonal produce some chef named Serge is offering at a Michelin-starred restaurant, but darn it if I can\xe2\x80\x99t go to Hardee\xe2\x80\x99s and eat a burger with some weird boneless ribs on it that were marketed on Shark Tank (yes, this is a thing).\n\nThese limited-time offers are where fast food gets weird, and when fast food gets weird, it gets fun. There are a couple of basic rules for running a good promotion.\n\nDid you cram more crap on your food? Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you cram more crap on your food?\n\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s it. It\xe2\x80\x99s simple. What McDonald\xe2\x80\x99s has done with this whole \xe2\x80\x9cfrork\xe2\x80\x9d fiasco is asked me to change my eating habits. It makes no damn sense. This is the veil being pulled off corporate America. Some dude in a $5,000 suit named \xe2\x80\x9cTodd,\xe2\x80\x9d probably with a \xe2\x80\x9cJr.\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cIII\xe2\x80\x9d on the end of his name, was looking for brownie points by saying: \xe2\x80\x9cYou know, I think America wants an edible fork.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNO I DON\xe2\x80\x99T WANT A DAMN EDIBLE FORK, TODD. I WANT TO CRAM THE FOOD INTO MY MOUTH CHUTE WITH MY UNWASHED HANDS BEFORE BLOWING MY NOSE ON THE GREASE-COVERED BAG AND SHAMEFULLY REALIZING I FINISHED AN ENTIRE MEAL AT A STOP LIGHT AND THEN SEEING THAT THE PERSON IN THE CAR NEXT TO ME VIDEO\xe2\x80\x99D ALL THIS. THAT\xe2\x80\x99S WHAT I WANT, TODD.\n\nThe frork appeals to a very limited part of the fast food Venn diagram, all of whom are idiots. It\xe2\x80\x99s people who want to keep their hands clean while eating, but also who want to get grease all over their fingers while they cram greasy fries into a fork-shaped holder.\n\nGOD, TODD, I SWEAR I HATE YOU SO MUCH.\n\nThey even released an infomercial about these things.\n\nLook, I know what you\xe2\x80\x99re thinking: This is all a tongue-in-cheek joke. I don\xe2\x80\x99t care that it\xe2\x80\x99s a joke. Time and effort were wasted on the frork that could have been used working out how to give me portable poutine at fast-food prices.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA limited supply of Frorks will be available with the purchase of a Signature Crafted Recipes sandwich on May 5 at participating restaurants. These sandwiches sell for between $4.99 and $5.19.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nGosh wow. I really couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have worked out this was going to be a limited supply. You mean to tell me that this trash idea created by an idiot named Todd (probably) is only going to be a small test? Wow \xe2\x80\x94 couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have worked that one out.\n\nAnd you know the part that really annoys me. There\xe2\x80\x99s going to be someone out there who calls themselves a \xe2\x80\x9cfast food historian\xe2\x80\x9d who\xe2\x80\x99s going to line up on May 5 and try to get a frork.\n\nI have such a high tolerance for bad promotions, but goodness if this doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make me mad. I\xe2\x80\x99m just going to try to forget this happened, ignore the frork ads, and wistfully lose myself in the Pizza Hut \xe2\x80\x9cPriazzo\xe2\x80\x9d ad when they tried to make deep dish pizza in the \xe2\x80\x9980s.\n\nP.S.

As 2017 Met Gala cochair of the \xe2\x80\x9cRei Kawakubo / Comme des Gar\xc3\xa7ons: Art of the In-Between\xe2\x80\x9d exhibition, Williams took to the red carpet in dressed-down Comme: a black moto jacket and plaid shirt from the label, paired with custom vintage jeans that read \xe2\x80\x9cRei\xe2\x80\x9d across one knee.

"b'From there, you transition to the leg press machine , but instead of placing your feet hip-width apart, you put them close together so that your knees are touching.

""There is no major advantage to doing the leg press with your feet together; it just works different muscle groups,"" she says.

Christian Anwander\n\nIn 2017, British actor Joe Alwyn shot four films across three continents in less than twelve months, and the resulting projects, all of which hit theaters in the latter half of this year, reveal his impressive range in a series of small but critical roles. First came Operation Finale, about the hunt for Nazi officer Adolf Eichmann (Ben Kingsley), with Alwyn as Eichmann\xe2\x80\x99s son. Then there was Boy Erased, a film about gay-\xc2\xadconversion therapy, in which Alwyn, alongside a cast including Nicole Kidman, Russell Crowe, and Lucas Hedges, played a closeted predator. The Favourite soon followed, a riotous period piece with Alwyn, as a besotted courtier, revealing a knack for physical comedy opposite Emma Stone.\n\nCoat ($930) by AMI Alexandre Mattiussi; turtleneck ($980) by Prada; trousers ($348) by Boss; sneakers ($180) by New Balance x Stu\xcc\x88ssy. Christian Anwander\n\nThis month, the twenty-\xc2\xadseven-year-old appears in a very different kind of period film, Mary Queen of Scots. Directed by Josie Rourke, it tells the true story of two young queens who are cousins and rivals for the English crown, with a fierce and brilliant Saoirse Ronan in the role of Mary and Margot Robbie as a powerful yet vulnerable Elizabeth I. Alwyn plays Robert Dudley, Elizabeth\xe2\x80\x99s right hand. \xe2\x80\x9cHe isn\xe2\x80\x99t driven by politics and ambition and power in the same way as the other male characters,\xe2\x80\x9d says Alwyn. \xe2\x80\x9cThe others try to circle the women and use them for their own advantage. That\xe2\x80\x99s not to say that my character is incapable of doing that, but he has higher priorities or higher feelings\xe2\x80\x94his love and loyalty to Elizabeth.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSweater ($2,740) by Louis Vuitton; trousers ($780) and boots ($1,095) by Givenchy. Christian Anwander\n\nAlwyn\xe2\x80\x99s big break came in a shot-out-of-a-cannon moment when Ang Lee cast him, at age twenty-four and fresh out of school, as the lead in the highly anticipated wartime drama Billy Lynn\xe2\x80\x99s Long Halftime Walk. The film stumbled at the box office, but Alwyn remains grateful: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s still the most amazing experience I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever had.\xe2\x80\x9d Landing a starring role so soon could have turned his head, but the young actor stayed focused on his work and regrouped by taking a number of smaller parts. \xe2\x80\x9cSince that film, I\xe2\x80\x99ve tried to make a conscious effort to find projects where, if there were supporting roles where I could learn and be surrounded by a great cast of actors and filmmakers and crew, then that was what I wanted to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nJacket ($1,950), shirt ($690), and trousers ($790) by Bottega Veneta; belt ($575) by Louis Vuitton.

He\xe2\x80\x99s currently shooting Harriet, about abolitionist Harriet Tubman, directed by Kasi Lemmons (Eve\xe2\x80\x99s Bayou). Throughout, Alwyn has retained an apprentice-\xc2\xadlike humility. \xe2\x80\x9cI still find it a strange readjustment when you go back to set,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cTo do your work in a way where you don\xe2\x80\x99t feel anxious and completely consumed by anxiety, it takes experience and practice.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nCoat ($3,900) and trousers ($890) by CALVIN KLEIN 205W39NYC; Calvin Klein Underwear T-shirt, Alwyn\xe2\x80\x99s own.

Asked whether anyone gave him guidance, Alwyn says he kept his own counsel. \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t seek out advice on that. Because I know what I feel about it. I think there\xe2\x80\x99s a very clear line as to what somebody should share, or feel like they have to share, and what they don\xe2\x80\x99t want to and shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have to.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThis article appears in the Winter '19 issue of Esquire.\n\nThis content is created and maintained by a third party, and imported onto this page to help users provide their email addresses.

"b'The day Corey Feldman met Corey Haim, when they were 14 years old and preparing to work together on the film \xe2\x80\x9cThe Lost Boys,\xe2\x80\x9d they bonded instantly. Both were young Jewish actors who often competed for the same roles. They shared a first name and even a favorite number, sort of. Haim\xe2\x80\x99s was 222. Feldman\xe2\x80\x99s was 22.\n\nAs they spoke, it became clear that they also shared horrific histories of abuse.\n\nHaim confided in his new friend that on the set of the 1986 film \xe2\x80\x9cLucas,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9can adult male convinced him that it was perfectly normal for older men and younger boys in the business to have sexual relations, that it was what all the guys do. So they walked off to a secluded area between two trailers . . . and Haim allowed himself to be sodomized.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHaim then followed this shocking tale with a question.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to his new bestie. \xe2\x80\x9cI guess we should play around like that, too?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe Meal Ticket\n\nIn \xe2\x80\x9cCoreyography,\xe2\x80\x9d Feldman \xe2\x80\x94 one of Hollywood\xe2\x80\x99s top child actors in the 1980s with hits like \xe2\x80\x9cStand By Me,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThe Lost Boys,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cGremlins\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cThe Goonies\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 shares tales of his own abuse at the hands of trusted adults throughout his Hollywood experience.\n\nAlong the way, he recounts his often twisted friendship with Haim \xe2\x80\x94 the two spent their teen years partying and living with their molesters (and no, Feldman writes, he did not take Haim up on his suggestion) \xe2\x80\x94 as well as his friendship with Michael Jackson, which, in a sign of how screwed up Feldman\xe2\x80\x99s life was, served as one of his healthiest and most supportive relationships.\n\nFeldman\xe2\x80\x99s troubles began at home. His mother, Sheila, was a former Playboy model with severe depression and drug issues, and his father, Bob, had been in a post-hit version of \xe2\x80\x9960s one-hit wonders Strawberry Alarm Clock and only seemed to care about his son when they were getting high together.\n\nSheila began telling Feldman how flawed he was at age 4, when she dyed his hair blond, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cYou were supposed to be blond.\xe2\x80\x9d She also tortured him about his weight, calling him fat and eventually force-feeding him diet pills.\n\nWhen she caught him sneaking two cookies when he was 5, she made him stand facing a wall for an hour, then went off, Feldman writes, on an insane verbal rant.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have no right to disrespect me like this . . . you ungrateful s \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x93 t,\xe2\x80\x9d she railed before somehow segueing to, \xe2\x80\x9cDo you realize that most women would die to look like this after two kids? Look at these t \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x93 s,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, cupping her breasts toward him.\n\nBy the time he was 7, Feldman was working as a commercial actor and was relied on as the family bread-winner. He was banned from ever riding a bicycle because, his mother told him, he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t afford to be injured. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have responsibilities now,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the starved-for-love Feldman began acting out on-set and became regarded by some as a brat. When he was fired from a TV movie, his mother forced him to remove his clothes as she reached for \xe2\x80\x9ca long wooden dowel . . . [that acted] as a window stop.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c \xe2\x80\x98How could you f \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x93 ing do this to me?\xe2\x80\x99 she screams. She is out of control, wild-eyed, like an animal. Her face is bright red and blotchy, her cheeks are streaked with mascara. \xe2\x80\x98You know I need this f \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x93 ing money. I will kill you. I will f \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x93 ing kill you, you worthless piece of s \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x93 t.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nFeldman tried to hide under his little brother\xe2\x80\x99s crib as his mother shoved the dowel toward him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s bent at the waist, ramming the pole under the cotton eyelet dust ruffle . . . jabbing at my ribs, my arms, my face,\xe2\x80\x9d he writes. \xe2\x80\x9cMy skin is raw and bleeding. I think that, maybe, she is serious. She really does want to kill me. Then everything goes black.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLater that week, she taunts him further.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m going to kill you.\xe2\x80\x99 My mother delivers this line in a sing-song cadence, like she\xe2\x80\x99s suggesting we go to a picnic, or make balloon animals, or fly a kite in Chatsworth Park. \xe2\x80\x98On Saturday,\xe2\x80\x99 she says, with a wink.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNights with \xe2\x80\x98Ron\xe2\x80\x99\n\nWith such turmoil at home, Feldman sought relief on Hollywood soundstages, where he could interact with other like-minded kids and hopefully be around genuine adult role models. But while Steven Spielberg, who hired him for the first time for \xe2\x80\x9cGremlins,\xe2\x80\x9d and director Richard Donner became trusted and supportive friends, most of the adults he met did him harm.\n\nHis father, who managed him for a time, hired an assistant in his early 20s who Feldman calls \xe2\x80\x9cRon.\xe2\x80\x9d Ron struck up an instant friendship with Feldman, who writes, \xe2\x80\x9cIt was almost eerie how similar we were. It was as if he had studied me and was copying my every move.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRon was soon spending all his time with Feldman, taking him out on the town and turning him on to new drugs. One night, after taking a concoction of pills \xe2\x80\x9cthat Ron had made up,\xe2\x80\x9d the woozy teenager felt a hand on his thigh. Ron asked if it was OK and wound up having oral sex with the \xe2\x80\x9cpetrified\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9crevolted\xe2\x80\x9d Feldman, who was frightened of a confrontation and of alienating his new close friend.\n\nThis twisted relationship lasted for years. With none of his family members there for him, Feldman formed relationships with any adults who reached out, and in numerous instances, these men turned out to be pedophiles. In one especially sad aside, he reflects on a picture he took at his 15th birthday party and notes that in the photo, he and Haim were flanked by five of them.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSlowly, over a period of many years,\xe2\x80\x9d he writes, \xe2\x80\x9cI would begin to realize that many of the people I had surrounded myself with were monsters.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIt got so bad that after fleeing Ron\xe2\x80\x99s clutches one night only to have another adult male friend attempt to molest him right after, he escaped to the only safe and friendly place he knew.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was shattered, disgusted, devastated. I needed some normalcy in my life. So, I called Michael Jackson,\xe2\x80\x9d he writes. \xe2\x80\x9cMichael Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s world, crazy as it sounds, had become my happy place. Being with Michael brought me back to my innocence. When I was with Michael, it was like being 10 years old again.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSurprisingly, his friendship with Jackson \xe2\x80\x94 who, he makes very clear, never touched him sexually or even tried to \xe2\x80\x94 includes some of the book\xe2\x80\x99s lightest passages.\n\nIntroduced by mutual friend Spielberg, the two became close friends, and Feldman got to know Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s playful side. When they spoke on the phone, Jackson would put on voices, including \xe2\x80\x9can imitation of what sounded like an uptight, conservative Caucasian, not unlike [when] Dave Chappelle . . . pretends to be white.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe pair confided in each other about their respective childhood traumas, with Feldman noting that even then, Jackson was \xe2\x80\x9cstill absolutely terrified of his father.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd when they decided to take a trip to Disneyland, Feldman discovered that Jackson kept a secret penthouse apartment on Wilshire Boulevard in Westwood, for the sole purpose of housing the many disguises he used when going out in public.\n\nSadly, the friendship ended in 2001, when Jackson heard a rumor that Feldman was planning to trash him in a book. Despite Feldman\xe2\x80\x99s adamant denials, Jackson shut him out, and the two never spoke again.\n\nCorey Gone Wild\n\nFar sadder was his friendship with Haim, a brotherhood bonded by terrors. From that first meeting, when Feldman had to explain to his new friend that having sex with grown men was \xe2\x80\x9cnot what kids do, man,\xe2\x80\x9d the two shared their best and worst moments.\n\nPublicly, they made nine films and starred in one TV series, the reality show \xe2\x80\x9cThe Two Coreys,\xe2\x80\x9d together and had their partying antics heavily documented in the press. But privately, these antics were driven by the darkest of secrets.\n\nFrom early on, whenever they hung out, Haim would beg Feldman to find him someone to have sex with, harping endlessly on, \xe2\x80\x9cI need a girl. I need a girl right now. Can you call a girl for me? Come on, man. I just need somebody to take care of me.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nOne time, Haim was so horny that he again tried to hook up with Feldman. Wanting to deflect his attention, Feldman writes, he referred Haim to a man he refers to as Tony Burnham who he knew had a crush on Haim, and Burnham became in Haim\xe2\x80\x99s life similar to what Ron was in Feldman\xe2\x80\x99s.\n\nThe boys\xe2\x80\x99 lives became so deranged that when Feldman\xe2\x80\x99s father kicked him out of the house, the only person Feldman had to turn to was Burnham, and he rationalized it because \xe2\x80\x9che was the only person in my immediate circle who wasn\xe2\x80\x99t molesting me.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nFeldman\xe2\x80\x99s cocaine use, which began when he once found his mother\xe2\x80\x99s stash, found him snorting an eight ball \xe2\x80\x94 an eighth of an ounce \xe2\x80\x94 every two days, a habit helped along by his new friendship with comedy party monster Sam Kinison. Together, the two smoked bales of weed in Feldman\xe2\x80\x99s trailer, and were \xe2\x80\x9chaving regular coke-off challenges, daring each other to see who can stay up the longest, who can do the most rails.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIn the ensuing years, Haim spiraled hard, even once being caught asking high-school students where he could buy crack.\n\nHis career in tatters, Haim rehabbed and relapsed several times, and died of pneumonia in 2010 at age 38.\n\nHell of Child Stars\n\nFeldman\xe2\x80\x99s spiral was harsh as well. His heroin habit \xe2\x80\x94 Ron had introduced him to that drug and crack \xe2\x80\x94 grew to $300 a day and precipitated several arrests. By 1990, he was \xe2\x80\x9cselling my CDs on a corner in exchange for crack rocks.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWhile attempts at sobriety proved challenging, he writes that since a severe but short relapse in 1995, he \xe2\x80\x9cnever had another hard drug again.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThese days, Feldman still acts \xe2\x80\x94 often in low-budget horror films \xe2\x80\x94 and performs music with his band, Truth Movement. He also has a 9-year-old son named Zen from his second marriage, to Playboy model Susie Sprague, which ended in 2009.\n\nAfter all he went through, Feldman has blunt words for those who propose to drag their children through show business.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeople always ask me about life after childhood stardom. What would I say to parents of children in the industry?\xe2\x80\x9d he writes. \xe2\x80\x9cMy only advice, honestly, is to get these kids out of Hollywood and let them lead normal lives.\xe2\x80\x9d'"

"b'Character on American television series Scandal\n\nQuinn Perkins, formerly Lindsay Dwyer, is a fictional character portrayed by Katie Lowes and created by Shonda Rhimes for the political drama television series Scandal. At the beginning of the series, she is recruited to work for Olivia Pope in the Washington, D.C.-based crisis management-firm, Olivia Pope & Associates (OPA), that specializes in ""fixing"" political situations and scandals.[1]\n\nBackground [ edit ]\n\nShe lived in California under the name Lindsay Dwyer, with her mom and dad, Ray Dwyer, where she graduated from Stanford Law School. Her boyfriend, Jesse Tyler, was a computer programmer for the company Cytron. Lindsay received a text-message which she believed was from a colleague at Jesse\'s work who wanted to contact him. Lindsay broke up with Jesse just before he and six other co-workers at Cytron were killed in an explosion which Lindsay was framed for. She was drugged, kidnapped and taken to Washington D.C. where she was given a new identity as Quinn Perkins.\n\nShe joined a law firm in D.C. called O\'Malley & Lee under her assumed identity. She was then called in to an interview by Harrison Wright to which she was hired to work at Olivia Pope & Associates.[2]\n\nStorylines [ edit ]\n\nSeason 1 [ edit ]\n\nQuinn gets a job at Olivia Pope & Associates after an interview with Harrison Wright, who she believed was a blind date. She is tasked by Olivia to watch Amanda Tanner at the hospital after Amanda tries to commit suicide.[2] As Olivia hires Amanda as her client, Quinn is the only one in the office allowed to help her with the case. She begins to form a relationship with a news-reporter Gideon Wallace after trying to find out what he knows about Amanda Tanner. Quinn begins to learn how the law-firm works and forms a friendship with Huck, the tech guy at the firm.\n\nQuinn and Gideon\'s relationship begins to evolve and they agree to be together as long as Gideon doesn\'t ask questions about Amanda Tanner. When Gideon figures out the truth about Amanda and President Grant\'s alleged affair, he confronts Billy Chambers, who is revealed to have slept with Amanda. Chambers attacks Gideon and stabs him in the neck with scissors, ultimately killing him.[3] When Quinn discovers the body, she calls Olivia, who decides to clean up the crime scene. Later, when Quinn is taken to the police station, David Rosen runs her fingerprints and discovers her past life as Lindsay Dwyer. He then confronts Olivia about going to the police to reveal Quinn\'s real identity.[4]\n\nSeason 2 [ edit ]\n\nAfter spending six months in jail awaiting trial, Quinn is prosecuted in federal court for the Cytron explosion, which led to the deaths of her ex-boyfriend Jesse Tyler and six other co-workers. People have begun calling her ""The Molotov Mistress"". David Rosen is the prosecutor of the case and asks for the death penalty. However, Olivia contacts Supreme Court Justice Verna Thornton, who managed to get the judge to agree upon a judgment of acquittal and Quinn goes free.[5] After getting released from jail, Quinn struggles to earn respect from her co-workers, as they treat her differently due to the fact she lied to them about her past life.\n\nSeason 3 [ edit ]\n\nAfter torturing Billy Chambers, Huck begins to distance himself from her. When on a case for Congresswoman Josie Marcus, Quinn buys herself a gun and begins to practice at the shooting range with a little help from Charlie.[6] Wanting to get adrenaline, Quinn joins Charlie on one of his B613-assignments where she is tricked by Charlie into killing a security guard who was an important part of an investigation being conducted by Olivia and the team.[7] Charlie uses this to blackmail her into joining B613. While searching through security footage Huck finds out that Quinn was responsible for the security guard\'s death and starts to torture her by pulling out her teeth for betraying Olivia. When she comes back to the office, she learns that Huck doesn\'t regret his actions, which leads her to leave Pope & Associates.[8]\n\nQuinn and Charlie\'s relationship begins to evolve as they are hired by Cyrus to help clean up the crime scene where Daniel Douglas was murdered. Olivia tries to convince Quinn to come back to the firm, but Quinn refuses. Jake, now the new Command of B613, is hesitant to let Quinn work at the organization.[9] Huck begins to visit her to try and convince her to come back, but Quinn refuses. She expresses her anger towards Huck for torturing her, and they end up kissing. Charlie begins to be concerned about Huck\'s behavior towards Quinn. She must confront her former colleagues when she and Charlie are called into Pope & Associates by Jake to help Olivia and her team to find Maya Pope. Quinn is caught in the middle when Huck and Charlie disagree on the way of locating Dominic Bell. Quinn and Huck end up kissing and having sex at the parking garage outside Pope & Associates, which leads Maya to walk past them and stab Rowan.[10] Abby and Harrison catch them having sex at the office, which shocks them. After Quinn broke up with Charlie, he gives her an envelope which contains information about Huck\'s former family. When she tries to give Huck the information, he becomes furious at her and terminates their relationship.[11]\n\nSeason 4 [ edit ]\n\nQuinn continues to run OPA after Olivia leaves with Jake, and tries to track her down. She has also kept in touch with Abby and Huck everyday in the two months Olivia was gone. Quinn finally manages to track Olivia down and sends her an envelope with information about Harrison\'s death. This prompts Olivia to return to Washington D.C.\n\nQuinn struggles with Huck as he is angry with her for finding out about his family and his feelings towards her. Jake asks Quinn for help in his investigation concerning Jerry and Harrison\'s death. Jake asks her to talk to Charlie and she agrees. Catherine Winslow, a former colleague of Olivia and Abby, asks OPA for help and Quinn begins to investigate the case as Catherine\'s daughter is killed. Quinn confronts Catherine\'s husband, but he shoots himself right in front of Quinn. Quinn then finds an envelope containing pictures of Olivia which she discusses with Huck.\n\nAt a stakeout spying on Kubiak, Quinn follows him to where Huck is spying on Elizabeth North. She discover that Kubiak, Elizabeth and Vice President Andrew Nichols are working together. She later figures out that the goal is to start a war between the U.S. and West-Angola by kidnapping Olivia and force Fitz to declare a war. When Olivia is kidnapped, Quinn, Huck and Jake team up to find her. They figure out her location in Pennsylvania, but the kidnappers had already left before they arrive. They try to bid on the auction of Olivia on the black market, but lose. Quinn becomes terrified when Huck starts talking about what the buyers will do to Olivia to make Fitz obey. She confronts him about it, admitting that she needs him to make herself feel okay.\n\nRelationships [ edit ]\n\nHuck [ edit ]\n\nHuck is the first person Quinn begins to form a friendship with at Olivia Pope & Associates. Throughout the first season Huck helps her around the firm. After her release from jail for the Cytron-explosion, Huck isn\'t angry at her, unlike the rest of the people at Pope & Associates. However, Quinn begins to become suspicious about her kidnapping and starts to suspect Huck for being the one who drugged her. She also attends several AA-meetings where Huck talks about his addiction to whiskey. However, Quinn realizes that he is actually talking about his addiction to torturing people and he merely passes it off as ""drinking whiskey"".\n\nQuinn becomes suspicious of Becky, Huck\'s new girlfriend, who he\'d met at an AA-meeting, and tries to warn Huck about her. She starts to find information regarding her own kidnapping and she asks Huck questions about how to kidnap someone. She later accuses him for kidnapping her, which later turns out to be true, at the orders of Olivia. When they discover that Hollis Doyle hired Becky to kill Quinn\'s former boyfriend Jesse, Quinn tries to hire Huck to kill him. Huck agrees, but only if she leaves after he has completed the request, but Quinn ends up deciding to call off the murder of Hollis Doyle. Huck begins to teach Quinn his methods, trying to make her his prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9. He teaches her how to be a spy and investigate. Quinn learns quickly. When Huck is captured by Charlie and put in a box, Quinn manages to rescue him. Afterwards, Huck suffers from PTSD and she tells him that he helped her move forward with her life. At the end of the second season, Quinn takes over for Huck in the torturing Billy Chambers when Huck freezes, which affects their friendship.\n\nHuck starts to shut Quinn out after she tortured Billy Chambers and he realizes how much she has changed. Quinn starts to hang out with Charlie, much to Huck\'s displeasure. When Huck finds out that Quinn killed a security guard, who was crucial for the firm\'s investigation, he tries to punish her by pulling out her teeth.

"b""Photography via Getty\n\nHave We Reached the End of Our 3,600 Word Jelena Timeline?\n\nSo. Much. Drama.\n\nEvery relationship has its ups and downs, but when we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez, that\xe2\x80\x99s approximately seven years of roller-coaster emotions.\n\nThe two sparked dating rumours in 2010 and captured the hearts of both their fan bases, resulting in the #Jelena hashtag. Since Bieber and Gomez are two of the most famous young stars of their time, their admirers range from supportive to downright obsessive.\n\nTheir relationship is kind of very hard to follow, but luckily, we\xe2\x80\x99ve broken down every single one of their breakups and makeups. Grab a snack, because there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot to dive into.\n\nphotography via instagram.com/jelena_firstofall\n\nJanuary 2011: Vacation in St. Lucia\n\nBieber/Gomez dating rumours began to circulate in 2010. But it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t until January 2011 that the pop stars confirmed their romance, namely by partaking in major PDA while on vacation together in St. Lucia.\n\nPhotography by Jon Kopaloff/FilmMagic\n\nFebruary 2011: Jelena steps out on red carpet at the Vanity Fair Oscars party\n\nYup, they finally made our dreams a reality by walking the red carpet together for the first time, thus confirming their young love. Aren\xe2\x80\x99t they adorable?\n\nphotography by Kevin Mazur/Contributor/Getty\n\nMay 2011: Billboard Music Awards\n\nJelena looked happy and strong at the Billboard Music Awards. Oh, young love.\n\nphotography by steve granitz/contributor/getty\n\nNovember 2011: Jelena is over\xe2\x80\xa6 apparently\n\nRumours that Gomez has dumped the Canadian pop star begin to surface, after a Bieber fan claimed she had sex with him backstage at a show in October 2010, and that he is the father of her 4-month-old child. However, it\xe2\x80\x99s confirmed that the breakup rumours aren\xe2\x80\x99t true.\n\nphotography via pinterest\n\nNovember 2012: The couple officially breaks up; Bieber briefly linked to model Barbara Palvin\n\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t go anywhere, this is just the first of many breakups. After more than a year of puppy love, the two reportedly split for the first time as a result of their jam-packed schedules. Fans (and the internet) also begin to wonder whether there\xe2\x80\x99s a relationship brewing between JB and Victoria\xe2\x80\x99s Secret model Barbara Palvin. Palvin took to Twitter, confirming that there was nothing going on between her and Bieber.\n\nphotography via instagram.com/ashilrd\n\nJanuary 2013: The pair are reportedly back together; Gomez travels to Norway to visit Bieber\n\nThey clearly can\xe2\x80\x99t stay away from one another for long. Less than 3 months after the duo called it quits, Bieber posted the above image of them on his Instagram\xe2\x80\xa6 and of course, promptly deleted it.\n\nPhotography by Kevin Mazur/WireImage\n\nNovember 2014: Gomez performs at the American Music Awards\n\nThe singer took to the stage to perform her single, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Heart Wants What It Wants.\xe2\x80\x9d Here\xe2\x80\x99s the kicker: she confirmed the song was about Bieber. After a few more on-again off-again appearances in the media, the couple officially confirmed they\xe2\x80\x99d split.\n\nphotography via instagram.com/mommyhaileybaldwin\n\n\n\nDecember 2014: Bieber denies Hailey Baldwin dating rumours\n\nJelena, what? We\xe2\x80\x99re now onto Jailey. Talks that Bieber is dating model Hailey Baldwin are at a high. However, JB denies these rumours, assuring fans that they are simply good friends (whatever that means).\n\nphotography via instagram.com/zedd\n\nJanuary 2015: Gomez and Zedd dating rumours begin\n\nShortly after the Jailey rumours came out, Gomez was seen getting close with DJ Zedd. This romance was not confirmed until later that year in September, when Gomez spoke with Elle for an interview.\n\nphotography via instagram.com/selenamylight\n\nSeptember 2015: Gomez opens up about Bieber in ELLE\n\nGomez discusses her past relationship with her fellow pop star and states that she will always support him.\n\nphotography via instagram.com/selgselgenator\n\nNovember 2015: Bieber appears on The Ellen DeGeneres Show\n\nIn November 2015, JB stopped by Ellen, and while discussing his upcoming album Purpose, he revealed which songs were inspired by Selena\xe2\x80\x94thanks for the intel, Biebs! The songs? Check out \xe2\x80\x9cWhat Do You Mean?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cSorry\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cMark My Words\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\nphotography via instagram.com/haileybaldwin\n\nJanuary 2016: Bieber and Baldwin hang out on New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Eve\n\nWas it not recently that JB confirmed that he and Baldwin were just good friends? Yes, but now things appear to have changed. The two celebs took their romance public on Instagram. However, it\xe2\x80\x99s unclear how long the this romance lasted, as they\xe2\x80\x99ve since broken up.\n\nphotography via instagram.com/sofiarichie\n\nAugust 2016: Sofia Richie posts an Instagram of her and Bieber\n\nYes, Sofia Richie, daughter of Lionel Richie, and sister of Nicole Richie. Bieber and Richie both took to Instagram recently to post photos of their time in Japan. The comments on both their accounts proved one thing for sure: do not mess with Jelena fans.\n\nPhotography via Instagram.com/selenagomez\n\nAugust 2016: Gomez posts a clip of her singing \xe2\x80\x9cLet Me Love You\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSo, just when we thought the dust had settled between Jelena, this clip surfaced of Gomez singing DJ Snake\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cLet Me Love You,\xe2\x80\x9d which features the Biebs on vocals. An official cover has yet to be released; however, suspicions that it\xe2\x80\x99s coming soon have been heightened as DJ Snake posted a longer version of Gomez\xe2\x80\x99s cover on his Snapchat. I think we can all agree that it\xe2\x80\x99s a little odd of Selena to chose to cover her ex\xe2\x80\x99s song after feuding over his new boo Sofia. But hey, you do you, Selena!\n\nphotography via instagram.com/revivaltour\n\nNovember 2016: Bieber allegedly visits Gomez in rehab\n\nGomez pulled out of her Revival Tour, in late August, due to complications caused by Lupus; mainly symptoms surrounding anxiety and panic. As a result, she checks in to rehab facility (feel better soon, Selena!). Rumours of Bieber visiting Gomez in rehab have started to circulate. Can somebody seriously loop us in, please?!\n\nPhotography by Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images\n\nJanuary 2017: Gomez and The Weeknd spotted together\n\nThe 24-year-old songstress was spotted making out with Canadian singer The Weeknd in photographs released by TMZ. According to the celeb news site, Gomez and The Weeknd (real name: Abel Tesfaye) were \xe2\x80\x9cgetting handsy and mouthy\xe2\x80\x9d outside Giorgio Baldi restaurant in Santa Monica, Calif. They then made it Instagram official (sort of) during a trip to Italy where the pair were spotted wining and dining (and kissing, duh!) in Venice and Florence.\n\nPhotography by Charley Gallay/AMA2015/Getty Images for dcp\n\nFebruary 2017: JB and The Weeknd begin to feud\n\nWhile out in Los Angeles, Bieber was asked by paparazzi if he would listen The Weeknd\xe2\x80\x99s music, to which he responded with a simple \xe2\x80\x9cHell, no.\xe2\x80\x9d Fast forward to Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s Day, when a track called \xe2\x80\x9cSome Way\xe2\x80\x9d by Toronto rapper Nav, featuring The Weeknd drops. \xe2\x80\x9cI think your girl / think your girl / fell in love with me,\xe2\x80\x9d the singer croons. The song also delves into NSFW territory: \xe2\x80\x9cShe say my fuck and my tongue game a remedy.\xe2\x80\x9d Yikes! A day later, DJ Kygo\xe2\x80\x99s single \xe2\x80\x9cIt Ain\xe2\x80\x99t Me\xe2\x80\x9d drops, featuring Gomez, and let\xe2\x80\x99s just say the lyrics appear to allude to a certain former flame. Serious. Drama.\n\nPhotography via Instagram/_marissamarino\n\nApril 30, 2017: Selena reportedly pens a JB diss-track\n\nThe Sun reports that Gomez and singer/songwriter Charli XCX have collaborated on a track titled \xe2\x80\x9cBad Girlfriend.\xe2\x80\x9d The British tabloid speculates that the song is about Justin Bieber, and states that a source has told them that it\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\xa6about a boyfriend the girl is no longer really into and has finally gotten wise to.\xe2\x80\x9d One of the alleged lines, according to The Sun is: \xe2\x80\x9cI know I\xe2\x80\x99m not there for you or there when you call. I\xe2\x80\x99m a bad girlfriend/I\xe2\x80\x99m a bad girlfriend.\xe2\x80\x9d So. Much. Shade.\n\nPhotography via Instagram/selenagomez\n\nMay 2017: Selena promotes new single on Instagram\n\nLast week, Gomez took to her Instagram to tease fans with news of her upcoming single. The singer posted a trio of highly-stylized (read: dark, moody) images featuring the words \xe2\x80\x9cBad Liar\xe2\x80\x9d scrawled with lipstick on a mirror. As a result, many are speculating that the song must be about her (surprise!) infamous ex-boyfriend. What we can confirm is that the track is scheduled to drop May 18.\n\nJune 2017: Selena compliments Justin on a radio talk show.\n\nDuring an interview on Sirius XM\xe2\x80\x99s Morning Mash Up, \xe2\x80\x8bSelena was asked \xe2\x80\x8bto share \xe2\x80\x8bher thoughts on Ariana Grande\xe2\x80\x99s #OneLoveManchester benefit concert\xe2\x80\x8b. Turns out \xe2\x80\x8bshe had nothing but \xe2\x80\x8bgood things to say about the performers, including Justin.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was beautiful,\xe2\x80\x9d says Selena. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought everyone did such a beautiful job. It was so gorgeous. I love how she [Ariana] ended it. I thought Justin did great. It was really beautiful.\xe2\x80\x9d Cue the wild screams tweets from Jelena fans.\n\nJELENA IS RISING AGAIN YOU GUYS pic.twitter.com/ea9zylAaSZ \xe2\x80\x94 shooters for krisdeana (@belizafucked) June 5, 2017\n\nPhotography by Kevin Mazur/WireImage\n\nJune 2017: A Selena and Justin duet reportedly leaked on Soundcloud\n\nThe two recorded an incomplete single called \xe2\x80\x9cSteal Our Love\xe2\x80\x9d back in 2013/2014 before their final breakup. While the song is no longer available to listen to (it was leaked and then swiftly taken off of Soundcloud), the Jelena fans over at Elle has kindly provided us the lyrics. And judging from the lines, the songs tells the story of two people in a troubled relationship who are fighting to make it work.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t seem to choose what to do / There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing I can say / I\xe2\x80\x99m tired of the fight \xe2\x80\x99cause I\xe2\x80\x99m never right / I just wanna cry, no,\xe2\x80\x9d Selena allegedly sings.\n\nSounds familiar?\n\nPhotography via Instagram/@justinbieber\n\nAugust 2017: Justin releases a new song titled \xe2\x80\x9cFriends\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan we still be friends?\xe2\x80\x9d Bieber asks on his latest track with Bloodpop. He\xe2\x80\x99s singing to to an ex who he swears he\xe2\x80\x99s over but can\xe2\x80\x99t quite completely, and (obviously) fans assume he\xe2\x80\x99s singing to Selena. The plot thickened when people started realizing that Julia Michaels, a good friend of Selena, co-wrote the single. Hmmm\xe2\x80\xa6could this be the start of a healthy post-romance friendship?\n\nPhotography via Twitter/@heardtroye\n\nAugust 2017: Nude photos of Justin are posted to Selena\xe2\x80\x99s Instagram\n\nWith 125 million followers, Selena Gomez is the most followed person on Instagram. So when hackers posted nude photos of her ex-bf to her account, a LOT of people noticed. When Selena\xe2\x80\x99s team clued in, they swiftly took down her page to remove the NSFW photos and re-secure her account. Gomez\xe2\x80\x99s Instagram was back online minutes later, with the nude pics deleted.\n\nThe explicit photos posted aren\xe2\x80\x99t new: these are the same Bieber images that were published after the pop star\xe2\x80\x99s Bora Bora vacation in 2015. Obviously, that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make it okay\xe2\x80\x94we should never look a someone\xe2\x80\x99s naked body without their consent.\n\nOctober 2017: Justin and Selena spotted hanging out at Gomez\xe2\x80\x99s home\n\nLooks like Bieber\xe2\x80\x99s song \xe2\x80\x9cFriends\xe2\x80\x9d really was about Selena! At the end of October, Justin was spotted at his ex-girlfriend\xe2\x80\x99s home in California. According to TMZ, Jelena spent time with mutual friends, and Selena\xe2\x80\x99s current boyfriend, The Weeknd, was fully aware of the hangout. TMZ also reports Justin and Selena first reconnected around the time Gomez announced she\xe2\x80\x99d undergone a kidney transplant. All\xe2\x80\x99s well that ends well!\n\nOctober 2017: Justin and Selena go to church together\n\nIt was Sunday Funday for Jelena, with the former lovers spending the full day together on Oct. 29, 2017. According to TMZ, Justin and Selena first attended church service together before grabbing a bite to eat at Joi Cafe in Westlake Village, California. The exes reportedly left together, and Biebs showed up at Selena\xe2\x80\x99s doorstep later that evening. A Sunday well spent brings a week of content!\n\nOctober 2017: Selena is single, and Justin is THRILLED\n\nSound the alarms! According to a source via People, the \xe2\x80\x9cSorry\xe2\x80\x9d singer is \xe2\x80\x9chappy Selena is single. He hopes to regain her trust so they can get back together.\xe2\x80\x9d According to Bieber\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cclose friend\xe2\x80\x9d/wingman, \xe2\x80\x9cIt seems their relationship now is very different. Justin is certainly a much better person. He would be a better boyfriend, too.\xe2\x80\x9d Maybe Justin\xe2\x80\x99s song \xe2\x80\x9cFriends\xe2\x80\x9d wasn\xe2\x80\x99t about Selena after all\xe2\x80\xa6\n\nNovember 2017: Justin and Selena get pretty cozy\n\nWell these two aren\xe2\x80\x99t wasting any time are they? Jelena hung out in L.A. AGAIN the morning of November 1: They\xe2\x80\x99re biking, they\xe2\x80\x99re laughing, they\xe2\x80\x99re nuzzling into one another, and it\xe2\x80\x99s ALL going down in front of photographers. It\xe2\x80\x99s not PDA, but it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty close. All we need now is an Insta official pic from @justinbieber or @selenagomez.\n\nNovember 2017: Selena wears Justin\xe2\x80\x99s hockey jersey\n\nSelena Gomez wearing Justin Bieber's hockey jersey is the Canadian equivalent of getting engaged, right? pic.twitter.com/Xr3SdQTSfq \xe2\x80\x94 Erica Steiner (@SendARavenPlz) November 2, 2017\n\nOkay, so it\xe2\x80\x99s not a PDA social media post \xe2\x80\x94 but it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty close! Selena arrived at the LA Vallet Ice Centre in an all-black ensemble, and after cheering on her ex (?!) boo, left the building wearing Beiber\xe2\x80\x99s New Jersey Devils hockey jersey. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t the \xe2\x80\x98borrowed-from-a-boy\xe2\x80\x99 look the international indicator of love?\n\nNovember 2017: Jelena is kissing in public again\n\nGuess it\xe2\x80\x99s not too late to say sorry for #SelenaGomez and #JustinBieber ? #Jelena A post shared by FASHION Magazine (@fashioncanada) on Nov 16, 2017 at 9:45am PST\n\n\n\nThis is the PDA confirmation we were waiting for! TMZ has shared photos that show the pop singers sealing the deal with a rink-side kiss at one of Justin\xe2\x80\x99s hockey games. To all those who doubted Jelena: we told you so.\n\nNovember 2017: Justin likes then unlikes a pic of Selena on Instagram\n\n?| Justin Bieber liked this photo of Selena on Instagram pic.twitter.com/gvo1ZnDKr4 \xe2\x80\x94 Selena Gomez Source (@GomezSource) November 20, 2017\n\nJustin Bieber unliked https://t.co/vJbNYlFKRz \xe2\x80\x94 Selena Gomez Source (@GomezSource) November 20, 2017\n\nTrouble in paradise already? Fans freaked out after they noticed Bieber liked a photo of Selena on Instagram, only to unlike it a few minutes later (\xe2\x80\x9cTheir whole relationship in a nutshell,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked one clever Twitter user). Granted, the photo wasn\xe2\x80\x99t actually posted on Gomez\xe2\x80\x99s account but rather a fan account meaning Biebs (who currently doesn\xe2\x80\x99t follow Selena, nor does she follow him) is resorting to exploring the \xe2\x80\x98gram for pics of his lady.\n\nIn other news, the \xe2\x80\x9cWolves\xe2\x80\x9d songstress quietly unfollowed ex-boyfriend The Weeknd on Instagram, and he later followed suit. And now we wait for the real indicator of the relationship status of Jelena: the duo hitting the \xe2\x80\x9cFollow\xe2\x80\x9d button on each others\xe2\x80\x99 accounts.

According to Entertainment Tonight, the mystery girl is Baskin Champion, younger sister to Abby Champion, actor Patrick Schwarzenegger\xe2\x80\x99s GF. Champion and Bieber attended Craig David\xe2\x80\x99s concert together in Los Angeles Tuesday night, where sources say Bieber had his \xe2\x80\x9carm wrapped around her waist during one song, and she was spotted dancing up on him throughout the show.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMarch 2018: Justin and Selena have reportedly called it quits \xe2\x80\x94 for good\n\nGrab your tissue box: it looks like Jelena\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cbreak\xe2\x80\x9d has turned into a break-up. Reports say that Bieber is holding out for a reunion, but \xe2\x80\x9cSelena realized even though he\xe2\x80\x99s made some positive improvements, they just aren\xe2\x80\x99t a perfect match right now,\xe2\x80\x9d a source told E! News. The bad news gets worse, because the source also said that the two aren\xe2\x80\x99t talking anymore (cue the Charlie Puth x Selena Gomez song.)\n\nFans think Gomez\xe2\x80\x99s latest outfit \xe2\x80\x94 a pair of itty-bitty Daisy Dukes and a yellow t-shirt that read, \xe2\x80\x9cNever underestimate the power of a woman\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 is hinting at the heartbreak.

This seven year on-again-off-again drama is giving us serious whiplash.\n\nMay 2018: Selena has apparently \xe2\x80\x9ccompletely moved on\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHave we reached the end of our lover\xe2\x80\x99s saga? Multiple sources have told E! News that Gomez is over Bieber and not interested in rekindling their romance any time soon. \xe2\x80\x9cShe respects him as a person but has decided she is much happier doing her own thing.,\xe2\x80\x9d said one insider to E! Selena rarely even talks about Justin anymore, and is fully open to dating.\xe2\x80\x9d So, is this the conclusion of the on-again-off-again romance? Or has precedent shown us that this is just another bump in the road for these star crossed lovers?\n\nJune 2018: Justin and Hailey Baldwin are hanging out again\n\nAhhh another rekindled love! This past weekend, the once rumoured couple reunited for a few days of bikinis and bibles in Miami. They were photographed drying each other off by the pool, attending a church conference and snuggling on the VIP balcony of LIV Nightclub at Fontainebleau. You know, normal relationship stuff.\n\nJuly 2018: Justin and Hailey get engaged\n\nAfter just a month of dating, Bieber popped the big question to Baldwin at a resort in the Bahamas.\xe2\x80\x9cEveryone was at a restaurant on the property doing salsa dancing when Justin\xe2\x80\x99s security told everyone to put their phones away,\xe2\x80\x9d two witnesses told TMZ, who broke the story early July 8, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause something special was about to happen.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHave we finally reached the fateful end of our ongoing Jelena timeline? After seven years of drama, maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s best."""

Jost, is a former teacher at Staten Island Technical High School.[13][14] Raised Roman Catholic, he attended Regis High School in Manhattan, where he was the editor of the school newspaper The Owl.[11] He attended Harvard University,[8] where he majored in history and literature, with a focus on Russian literature and British literature and graduated cum laude in 2004. While at Harvard, he was president of the Harvard Lampoon.[9][15]\n\nCareer [ edit ]\n\nWhile at Harvard, Jost won $5,250 on a college edition of Weakest Link.

He was co-head writer from 2012 to 2015, and regained that status in late 2017.[16] He often collaborates with fellow SNL co-head writer Rob Klein.[17] During the summer hiatus following the 2012\xe2\x80\x9313 season, executive producer Lorne Michaels asked Jost if he could do the Weekend Update feature,[8] as co-anchor Seth Meyers would soon be leaving to host Late Night with Seth Meyers. Jost accepted and replaced Meyers on the March 1, 2014, episode.[18]\n\nJost names Norm Macdonald as a primary influence for his Update anchor work, as Macdonald\'s tone was the one Jost grew up with in high school. He also names Tina Fey as an influence.[8] In addition to Weekend Update, Jost made a brief cameo appearance as Ohio Governor John Kasich in a Republican presidential debate sketch.[19]\n\nJost has worked in multiple roles related to comedy.

In the March 4 episode, they got involved in a storyline with wrestler Braun Strowman, which resulted in both Jost and Che becoming participants in the Andr\xc3\xa9 the Giant Memorial Battle Royal at WrestleMania.[25][26] At the event, Jost and Che went under the ring for the majority of the match and then tried to eliminate Strowman while he was trying to do the same to the Hardy Boyz. Jost attempted to calm the situation by using his therapist, but Strowman chokeslammed him and eliminated the two comedians in quick succession, winning the battle royal.[27]\n\nIn July 2020, Jost released a memoir entitled, A Very Punchable Face: A Memoir.[28] The book was well received and appeared on the New York Times Bestseller List.[29]\n\nPersonal life [ edit ]\n\nJost began a relationship with actress Scarlett Johansson in May 2017.[30] In May 2019, Jost and Johansson were engaged.[31] They married in October 2020.[32]\n\nJost was dorm-mates with 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg while the two lived in Leverett House at Harvard.[33] In 2015, Jost donated $100 to Buttigieg\'s mayoral reelection campaign.[34][35] Subsequently, during Buttigieg\'s presidential campaign, Jost portrayed Buttigieg in the 45th season of SNL.[33][36]\n\nFilmography [ edit ]\n\nFilm [ edit ]\n\nTelevision [ edit ]\n\nBibliography [ edit ]\n\nAwards and honors [ edit ]\n\nReferences [ edit ]'"
"b'The hearts of Hollywood are with Keaton Jones .\n\nThe student\'s story went viral on Friday after Jones\' mother, Kimberly Jones shared a video of her tearful son describing the bullying he suffers at school. ""Why do they intimidate? What\'s the use?"" the young man asked while talking to the camera, detailing how his teammates had spilled milk, mocked his appearance and called him ""ugly"".\n\n""It is not necessary to criticize people who are different,"" the angry boy urged anyone watching. ""It\'s not your fault, but if you make fun of them, just do not let them bother you. They stink, I guess.""\n\nKimberly also explained that the video was taken after she picked up her song from school because she was afraid to go to lunch. ""My children are not at all perfect, and at home, he\'s like all the kids that come, but from what he looks like, he\'s good at school, talk to his kids,"" he encouraged.

Yeah, it\xe2\x80\x99s very, very exciting.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe wedding won\xe2\x80\x99t be for a while, however: Williams said that the couple is waiting until the latest season of Game of Thrones is over to start wedding planning, although she thinks Turner is \xe2\x80\x9calready letting her little heart wonder and imagine.\xe2\x80\x9d (Perhaps about how to work in some custom Louis Vuitton?)\n\nThe two actresses, who play sisters on Game of Thrones, have long maintained a close friendship offscreen. Last year, Turner gushed about Williams in an interview: \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s my best friend, she\xe2\x80\x99s my soul mate. I love that girl to pieces,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.

"b'In the business of music, there\'s no name with as much resonance as Motown. Former Uptown Entertainment president Andre Harrell\xe2\x80\x94the man responsible for Jodeci, Mary J. Blige, and Heavy D\xe2\x80\x94is taking over the legendary label and promising to bring the noise. But can he fight through the nostalgia and lead Motown into the 21st century? By Anthony DeCurtis. Photographs by Dana Lixenberg\n\n""You know how Jeffrey Katzenberg became Disney? That\'s what I want to do. Like, how you felt Jeffrey had a passion about Disney\xe2\x80\x94his Mickey Mouse watches, Disney sweatshirt, Disney tie. That\'s what I\'m talking about. I will be at the Motown Cafe. I\'ll make Motown ties, watch\xc2\xades, sweatshirts. I intend to make Motown the black Disney,"" Andre Harrell says with a smile. ""You might as well start calling me Walt.""\n\nHarrell, 35, is obviously a man with a plan. Good thing, too. He\'s stepping into one of the most vis\xc2\xadible jobs in the entertainment industry: president and CEO of Motown Records. ""It\'s always been a dream of mine to head up Motown,"" he says.\n\nYet the lofty position confronts Harrell with a critical challenge. Motown has fallen far from what it once was. Aside from the monumental Boyz II Men, Motown has increasingly become a sound\xc2\xadtrack for nostalgia, much more redolent of the past than the present. It\'s so hard to say good-bye to yesterday, indeed. Harrell, a product of the hip hop generation, knows his job is to introduce Mo\xc2\xadtown\xe2\x80\x94music, television, film, video, animation, and new media\xe2\x80\x94to tomorrow.\n\nA Bronx native, he got his start in the early \'8os as half of the rap duo Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. (He was Dr. Jekyll.) After moving over to the business side of the business, he hooked up with rap mogul Russell Simmons and soon landed a top spot at Simmons\'s company, Rush Communications, where he worked with the likes of Run-D.M.C., L.L. Cool J, and Whodini.\n\nHarrell stepped out on his own in 1986, when he launched his own label, Uptown Entertain\xc2\xadment, as part of a joint venture with MCA. At Uptown, Harrell defined a contemporary R&B sound for the hip hop age, bringing the world Guy, Heavy D, Jodeci, Mary J. Blige, Al B. Sure!, Father MC, and most recently, Soul for Real (with whom he had his first No. 1 pop hit, ""Candy Rain""). He produced the 1991 film Strictly Business, and he coproduces the hit Fox series New York Undercover.\n\nSuccessful as the artists on his label proved to be, Harrell has felt constrained in his efforts to make them pop superstars, both by his arrange\xc2\xadment with Uptown\'s parent company, MCA, and by the troubling racial politics of the music busi\xc2\xadness in general. Moving to Motown, which is now based in Los Angeles and owned by PolyGram, presents Harrell with the opportunity to put at least some of these issues behind him. At Motown, Harrell says, he\'ll have more people, more prerogative, more punch.\n\nSeated on a couch in the living room of his Upper West Side New York apartment, dressed simply in a black shirt and white slacks, Harrell focused squarely through his blue shades on what must be done. A framed photo of a serious-looking Harrell arm-in-arm with Mickey Mouse sat on an end table.\n\nClearly a man who enjoys control, Harrell was soft-spoken and intent. He didn\'t want to be mis\xc2\xadunderstood. ""Am I correct?"" he would ask. ""Do you follow me?"" He leaned forward, and his voice rose with passion as he discussed his frustrations with MCA. Otherwise, he slipped back into the pil\xc2\xadlows of his sofa and spoke as if he was envisioning his future life in a dream.\n\nHarrell knows he has as much on the line as Motown, if not more. All eyes will be on him. It\'s one thing to say you would\'ve done something if only you\'d gotten the chance. It\'s quite another to get the chance and have to do it.\n\n""Every record has gotta be right,"" he said. ""I\'m trying to sign stars. I\'m not gonna have wack-juice on me. Never did, never will.""\n\nWhat has Motown meant to you over the years? When was the first time you knew what it was?\n\nThe first true Motown experience I had was when the Jackson 5 were on the Ed Sullivan Show. I think it might\'ve been, like, 1969, \'70. They sang ""Stand!"" and ""I Want You Back."" I had never seen a black teenager on television\xe2\x80\x94it was incredible. After that, I realized who the Motown artists were. My parents listened to them: the Supremes, Marvin Gaye, Diana Ross, the Four Tops, the Temptations.\n\nWhat did the company represent for you?\n\nMotown has always been the epitome of black excellence and artistry. Stevie sang about love in the most sensitive way, as well as telling about the plight of his people. Marvin sang about the plight of his people and his internal fight, but he sang about love in a very sexy way. They were major influences.\n\nSpeaking of Stevie Wonder, he made a strong album last year and nothing happened with it. Can Motown sell a Stevie Wonder record in this day and age?\n\nThe Four Tops, the Temps, and, especially, Stevie Wonder and Diana Ross\xe2\x80\x94these are national trea\xc2\xadsures. You have to treat them like events. Stevie Wonder, he\'s someone I would do an Unplugged with. Or a couple of years ago, it was Stevie\'s 3oth anniversary in show business. You could have got\xc2\xadten Stevie Wonder a television special. We could have had artists pay tribute to him\xe2\x80\x94pop artists, rock artists, R&B artists, rap artists, everybody could have participated. And there\'s probably no other female, black or white, who\'s as fabulous as Diana Ross, who epitomizes the glamour and excitement of a star diva.\n\nWhat about new directions? What makes Motown happen in the \'9os?\n\nMotown has to become the lifestyle label for the times that the active record-buying audience\xe2\x80\x94the audience who\'s 15 to 3o\xe2\x80\x94is living in. One of the ways you do this is by putting out records that are in the groove that that audience is living in. Like if Mary J. Blige was a Motown artist, Motown would have some of her imaging on it. It\'s that young, hip hop\xe2\x80\x94soul, Generation X energy. Same thing if Jodeci was on the label. Back in the day, Motown talked to everybody in the ghetto\xe2\x80\x94and it talked to the rest of the world too.\n\n""WHEN YOU THINK OF MOTOWN NOW, YOU\'RE GONNA THINK OF ANDRE HARRELL. I\'M NOT GONNA WORK FOR MOTOWN, I\'M GONNA BE MOTOWN.""\n\nThat sounds like the philosophy you espoused at Uptown.\n\nThe thing that [Motown founder] Berry Gordy led the way with is the idea that the label head becomes the image of the label. Myself, I allowed whatever celebri\xc2\xadty occurred in my career to happen through the artists. I was so consistent with the kinds of artists who were on my label, after a while, it was, like, ""Who\'s behind all this?"" I was behind it.\n\nGoing into Motown, my plan is this: When you think of Motown now, you\'re gonna think of Andre Harrell. I\'m not gonna work for Motown, I\'m gonna be Motown\xe2\x80\x94in the way I dress, the records I put out, the causes I choose to get involved in, the artists from the past, the artists who are there now, and the artists in the future. Like I lived Uptown Records, I\'m gonna live Motown Records.\n\nBut you, Russell Simmons, Sean .""Puffy"" Combs\xe2\x80\x94and Berry Gordy before you\xe2\x80\x94are entrepreneurs. You\'re identified with the companies you founded. With this, you\'re stepping into something\xe2\x80\x94\n\n\xe2\x80\x94that\'s already existing. I\'m gonna be Motown for this generation of young-adult record buyers. Motown was the blueprint. Berry Gordy was the blueprint for what I became.\n\nWere you conflicted about leaving Uptown?\n\nI had tremendous conflict. It was like I was walking away from my works of art. There will never be another Mary J. Blige\xe2\x80\x94it\'s rare to find a queen. There will nev\xc2\xader be another Jodeci. There\'ll never be another Heavy D. But I have to go, because Motown gives me the power I need to go to the next level. I have to make African-American superstars. At Uptown, I was able to make black icons, but they were icons only to black people.\n\n[I was] trying to grow Uptown, to have indepen\xc2\xaddence, to be able to say, ""This act is getting ready to be a worldwide star, and I\'m gonna take all my resources, and we\'re gonna march to this one beat."" I was trying to do that for nine years. Between me and the corpora\xc2\xadtion, I could never get it to happen.\n\nIn terms of support from MCA?\n\nI think MCA, after a period, wanted some of these things to happen. For whatever reasons, though, the execution between the two sides never worked. The biggest record I ever had was Jodeci\'s [1991] Forever My Lady\xe2\x80\x943 million.\n\nWhen [Arista president] Clive Davis got in the game, I felt myself shrinking. Once he got in business with LaFace [L.A. Reid and Kenneth ""Babyface"" Edmonds] and [Dallas Austin\'s] Rowdy Records and Puffy [Bad Boy Entertainment], Davis\'s commitment and his exe\xc2\xadcution were taking those artists where I wanted my artists to go. I wanted Mary J. Blige to sell the 7 million that Toni Braxton did.\n\nJodeci came to me because I had Al B. Sure! So they figured, ""He knows how to do this. We wanna be down with him."" They drove 13 hours, sat in my lobby for eight hours just to meet me. Now, I feel like, with Arista being involved with LaFace and the other labels, they sold 7 million Toni Braxtons. They sold 6 million TLCs. I\'m, like, if I can\'t sell these kinds of records, I\'m gonna slowly shrink. I was catching heat from my artists, who wanted that kind of stature. I would bring that frustra\xc2\xadtion to MCA, and we couldn\'t seem to come to terms.\n\nWas the idea, ""Well, Andre\'s doing fine. He\'s doing a cou\xc2\xadple of million here, a couple of million there. He\'s covered. Were gonna invest somewhere else""?\n\nI felt like a figurehead. I had all this energy around me\xe2\x80\x94like, I was the Man. I was the founder and chairman of Uptown Records, a major, culturally influen\xc2\xadtial entertainment company for African-Americans in the \'9os. But I didn\'t feel like the Man, because I could\xc2\xadn\'t put my finger on the button that would really make it happen. I don\'t want to be in that position anymore. I need to have more control. I need to be responsible for the big picture. And being at Motown positions me to create a truly black pop company. I got a film divi\xc2\xadsion, a television division. I got green-light power for small movies. I don\'t have to ask anybody.\n\nWhat are your plans with Gordy?\n\nWe\'re gonna do a series of commercials\xe2\x80\x94print and television. He endorses me. We spoke yesterday for about an hour, and he said, ""Any advice I can give you about where we go from here, feel free to call me."" We\'re gonna spend time together and talk about his history with the elder stars. I feel as if I\'ve had a tremendous amount of experience working with stars\' drama and ego, but we\'re talking a whole \'nother level of stars. I\'ve never built a superstar. There\'re superstars at this house.\n\nHow do you build superstars?\n\nIf black stars are gonna have a shot at becoming pop stars, it\'s gonna be because the chairman of the company is committed to them\xe2\x80\x94and because their music is his personal taste. That\'s what I\'m bringing to black music, to black musical stars. Not just their art form but their plight as African-American men and women.\n\nWhat you\'re describing is a role that black executives play, but aren\'t they often frustrated in their attempts to rise at most record companies?\n\nI can\'t talk about it enough, how few black execu\xc2\xadtives get to control their playing field. Black music is becoming the music of the popular culture. Because of that, companies are repositioning their priorities and trying to get in the game. But as black music becomes more important, there should be more black presidents and black chairmen. As soon as the black executive\'s artist reaches platinum, suddenly the artist and man\xc2\xadager have to deal with the president of the corporation, because he controls the priorities at pop radio. The black executive becomes obsolete. As his music gets bigger his power diminishes. He\'s more or less told, ""Go find the next act and establish it.""\n\nIt\'s an emphasis on the creative\xe2\x80\x94\n\n\xe2\x80\x94as opposed to the business. That\'s why young black executives don\'t get to become the old chairmen\xe2\x80\x94the wise men who\'ve seen it and done it. They get to stay hot black executives so long as their instincts are hot. But this is a lifestyle business\xe2\x80\x94only a few of us, black or white, are going to be cool enough to have great in\xc2\xadstincts our whole career.\n\nThe black executive is not given the opportunity to become the business and the music. Why not? Why shouldn\'t he be the one that everybody reports to? When you get an act that sells 5 million\xe2\x80\x94at a major compa\xc2\xadny\xe2\x80\x94the black executive\'s out of the room. But when there\'s some sort of problem, the major label looks at the black executive: ""Why can\'t you handle this act?"" When the artist hires a violent manager and the violent manager is coming up to the record company, the label\'s, like, ""How did it get to this?"" How? Because they [the white executives] couldn\'t see it coming. Because they re not sensitive to his issues. By then the relation\xc2\xadship between the record company and the artist is dys\xc2\xadfunctional. And then the black executive gets blamed and fired. But they created the monster.\n\nWhen I had the artist, I talked to his mother, his girl\xc2\xadfriend, his babies\' mother with the two children, dealt with his drug counselor, and whatever other dysfunc\xc2\xadtional Generation X problems he has. He\'d call me late at night.\n\nBut he feels like they\'re just businesspeople. And they don\'t understand. And they might be racist. He\'s comin\' with all that energy. Even if they like him as a person, he still has goo years of issues he has to get over to accept them. And they have a lot of work to do to gain his trust and respect.\n\nSo what are your immediate plans?\n\nI will be moving to Beverly Hills. I\'ll have a house out there for a 12-to-18-month period, and I\'ll be bicoastal between the New York and L.A. offices. Then I\'m moving the company to New York. I\'m going to have a satellite office in Atlanta\xe2\x80\x94A&R-oriented. I\'m going to build a recording studio in New York, Motown Studios.\n\nAny new musical directions?\n\nThe sound I\'m going for now is soul. I\'m looking for voices that sound like 400 years of slavery and then some. I\'m looking for that inspirational, take-us-out\xc2\xad-of-our-plight, Aretha Franklin, Bill Withers, Al Green voice. I\'m looking to build those kinds of stars now.\n\nWhat about the younger acts on Motown? Have you met with Boyz II Men?\n\nNo. Those meetings will come after I execute the deal. Boyz II Men are the biggest group I\'ve ever seen. I don\'t know what I\'m bringing to the party except to keep them from goin\' crazy from the level of success they\'ve had. They probably need a break, a little time out to lead their personal lives. Outside of that, that for\xc2\xadmula is working. Queen Latifah, I\'d like to bring her record sales up to match her celebrity. Zhan\xc3\xa9 I\'d like to give a little bit more image. I\'m gonna bring Johnny Gill back\xe2\x80\x94he had a fabulous first album. And I\'m excit\xc2\xaded about working with Michael Bivins. He\'s tremen\xc2\xaddously talented, and if he and I get together, we can real\xc2\xadly do some important things.\n\nAre you apprehensive?\n\nI got a lot of work to do. But no problems. Making hits is not a problem. I\'ll be making some noise real quick. And I ain\'t gonna stop makin\' noise until I\'m done.\n\n-\n\nThis article originally appeared in the Dec. 1995 - Jan. 1996 issue of VIBE Magazine | Written by Anthony DeCurtis | Header Photography by Dana Lixenberg'"

The average age, race, and body type of women depicted in media today still represents only a small fraction of the female population. Led by the Association of National Advertisers (ANA), SeeHer is a collective of leading marketers committed to creating advertising and supporting content that portrays women and girls as they really are. It launched in June 2016 in partnership with The Female Quotient (The FQ) in Washington DC at the United State of Women. To help marketers benchmark success, the group developed Gender Equality MeasureTM, GEMTM, the first research methodology that quantifies gender bias in ads and programming. GEMTM shows that content portraying females accurately dramatically increases purchase intent and brand reputation, increasing return on investment (ROI) by as much as 30 percent. GEMTM won the prestigious 2017 ESOMAR Research Effectiveness Award, and the methodology became the industry standard, which led to a global rollout in 2018. In 2019 the movement expanded into new verticals including sports (#SeeHerInSports) and music (#SeeHerHearHer.)\n\nVisit SeeHer.com and follow us on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter @SeeHer2020.\n\nAbout the Association of National Advertisers (ANA)\n\nThe ANA\xe2\x80\x99s mission is to drive growth for marketing professionals, for brands and businesses, and for the industry.
