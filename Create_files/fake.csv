"b'There was no shortage of celebrity beefs in 2017.\n\nWhether the fights were between co-stars or once close friends, the shade just kept coming. Let\'s take a look back at the most intense celebrity feuds of the year.\n\n1. Blac Chyna vs. Rob Kardashian\n\nBlac Chyna and Rob Kardashian\'s split turned a new level of nasty when the former couple exchanged wild accusations against one another in a heated, NSFW social media war in June. Kardashian shared graphic naked photos of Chyna, accused her of cheating on him multiple times and also accused her of being on drugs. Meanwhile, Chyna took to Snapchat to accuse Kardashian of also cheating on her and being physically abusive.\n\nOne month later, a judge granted Chyna\'s request for a temporary restraining order against Kardashian.\n\n""Revenge porn is a form of domestic abuse,"" Chyna\'s attorney, Lisa Bloom, said during a press conference.\n\nGreg Doherty/Getty Images\n\nBut the two now appear to be keeping it amicable when it comes to their daughter, 1-year-old Dream. In September, the two reached a custody agreement.\n\n""Chyna is pleased that Rob has agreed to peacefully co-parent Dream with her, as she has been requesting all along,"" Bloom said in a statement.\n\nKardashian\xe2\x80\x99s attorney, Robert Shapiro, also told ET at the time that ""Rob and Chyna are working together to put the best interest of their child first and have amicably resolved their personal matters.""\n\nOf course, Chyna is still suing Kardashian, his mom Kris Jenner and sister Kim Kardashian West over the cancellation of E!\xe2\x80\x99s Rob & Chyna.\n\n2. Dwayne Johnson vs. Tyrese Gibson\n\nAlberto E. Rodriguez/Getty Images\n\nThe drama between the Fast and Furious co-stars began in September, when Gibson left a comment on Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s Instagram post, asking him not to let a rumored spinoff film starring Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s character, Agent Hobbs, push back the planned release date of Fast 9.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m simply trying to reach him cause he won\xe2\x80\x99t call me back about this solo #HobbsMovie,\xe2\x80\x9d Gibson wrote in the lengthy comment. \xe2\x80\x9cI want you to shoot it just not right now cause the #Fast9 release date has already been announced.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe feud escalated one month later, when Gibson called out Johnson on Instagram, and slammed his critical and commercial flop, Baywatch.\n\n\n\nJohnson defended himself on Twitter.\n\n""My goal from day 1 was to come in and create an exciting/fun character for the fans, elevate the franchise and build it out,"" he tweeted.\n\nGibson also took to Twitter, to call his co-star ""selfish.""\n\n""The real selfish #CandyA** revealed,"" Gibson wrote. ""And why you on Twitter?? You lost my number right? I\'m at you when I see you #Family.""\n\n""You still promoting a movie that no one wants to see made you clown,"" he continued.\n\nOf course, Johnson didn\'t take the shady tweets lying down.\n\n""Pumped to expand and build out the FAST & FURIOUS universe in a cool, exciting way,"" Johnson captioned yet another Instagram post, adding, ""Thank you UNIVERSAL STUDIOS for being tremendous partners who see the big picture and for coming to us years ago with this spinoff idea.""\n\n\n\n""I have a tremendous amount of respect for this franchise that I\xe2\x80\x99ve enjoyed droppin\xe2\x80\x99 blood and sweat in over the years,"" he continued. ""And my vision is to create greater opportunities for not only my fellow FF cast mates, but for other amazing actors as well who want to be a part of something new and cool.The more opportunities we can create the better for the fans. Smart business,"" he argued. ""Let\xe2\x80\x99s have some FUN and to quote, Hobbs the boss, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t like it, we\xe2\x80\x99re happy to beat that a** like a Cherokee drum. #CandyA**esNeedNotApply.""\n\nAlthough Gibson Instagrammed in November that he was out of the Fast and the Furious franchise if Johnson was in, he later claimed he was ""never mad"" at Johnson .... though continued to slam him.\n\n""So the Rock how does it feel bro?.... going home to your daughter every night,"" he asked, referencing his highly publicized custody battle over daughter Shayla. ""It was 60 days before I seen my baby..... and all I asked you to do \'privately\' was NOT accept a role that would deeply affect us all....... You are simply NOT the people\xe2\x80\x99s champ..... you are a selfish champ.""\n\n3. Kanye West vs. JAY-Z\n\nGetty Images\n\nThe two close friends and collaborators\' falling out continued this year, after West publicly called JAY-Z out during an onstage concert rant last November.\n\n""You got hurt, because this guy was talking about you on a stage,"" JAY-Z commented in August during an interview with Elliott Wilson and Brian ""B.Dot"" Miller on the Rap Radar podcast. ""But what really hurt me, you can\'t bring my kid or my wife into it. Like, Kanye is my little brother. He\'s talked about me a hundred times. He even made a song called \xe2\x80\x98Big Brother.\' We\'ve gotten past bigger issues, but you brought my family into it, now it\'s a problem.""\n\nIn July, West reportedly left JAY-Z\xe2\x80\x99s Tidal over a money dispute.\n\nHowever, there is hope for those wishing for a Watch the Throne part two. During a Q&A with New York Times executive editor Dean Baquet for T: The New York Times Style Magazine in November, JAY-Z had a few conciliatory words for West, whom he still referred to as his ""brother.""\n\n""I [talked to] Kanye the other day, just to tell him, like, he\'s my brother,"" he recalled. ""I love Kanye. I do. It\'s a complicated relationship with us.""\n\nStill, JAY-Z admitted that there\'s currently tension between the two.\n\n""But that happens,"" he stressed. ""In the long relationship, you know, hopefully when we\'re 89 we look at this six months or whatever time and we laugh at that. There\'s gonna be complications in the relationship that we have to get through. And the only way to get through that is we sit down and have a dialogue and say, \'These are the things that I\'m uncomfortable with. These are the things that are unacceptable to me. This is what I feel.\' I\'m sure he feels that I\'ve done things to him as well. I\'m not a perfect human being by no stretch.""\n\n""[West is] a very compassionate person,"" he added. And a lot of times he get in trouble trying to help others, So, I can identify with it. It\'s just that there\'s certain things that happened that\'s not really acceptable to me. ... And we just need to speak about it. But there\'s genuine love there.""\n\n4. Camila Cabello vs. Fifth Harmony\n\nGetty Images\n\nThings turned messy between girl group Fifth Harmony and Camila Cabello pretty quickly after she announced she was leaving the group last December, and the remaining members -- Lauren Jauregui, Ally Brooke, Normani Kordei and Dinah Jane -- claimed in a statement that they only learned of her departure through her representatives.\n\nIn an interview with Billboard in February, Cabello talked about the \xe2\x80\x9cintense\xe2\x80\x9d split and admitted she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t spoken to her former bandmates.\n\n""I was always super open [that] I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t just sing other people\xe2\x80\x99s words and be totally happy with that,"" Cabello said of exiting the group. ""You have to follow and honor that inner voice. I always encouraged the girls to do the same.""\n\n""I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get into the details of that, because it was really intense and it\xe2\x80\x99s hard for me to talk about,"" she added about not keeping in touch. ""It makes me sad.""\n\nIn their own Billboard interview in July, Fifth Harmony wasn\xe2\x80\x99t shy about alluding to the bad blood.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s just say we\xe2\x80\x99re in a better place now -- there are no secrets in this circle,\xe2\x80\x9d Jane said of Cabello\'s exit.\n\nHowever, the shadiest moment definitely happened at the MTV Video Music Awards in August, when before their performance of ""Angel"" and ""Down,"" a a fifth member of the group -- presumably meant to represent Cabello -- fell backwards off the stage.\n\nThe group later denied they were slamming Cabello during an interview with Good Morning America.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe get asked all the time if we\xe2\x80\x99re getting a fifth member,\xe2\x80\x9d Brooke explained. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd we wanted to show the world in an artistic way that, \xe2\x80\x98Hey, the four of us are Fifth Harmony. We are stronger and better than we\xe2\x80\x99ve ever been.""\n\n5. Kim Cattrall vs. Sex and the City Cast\n\nNew Line Cinema\n\nRumors have floated around for some time now that Kim Cattrall didn\'t get along with her Sex and the City cast members, and they were pretty much confirmed this year, after Sarah Jessica Parker announced that there would be no Sex and the City 3 film.\n\n""It\'s over... we\'re not doing it,"" she told Extra. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m disappointed. We had this beautiful, funny, heartbreaking, joyful, very relatable script and story. It\xe2\x80\x99s not just disappointing that we don\xe2\x80\x99t get to tell the story and have that experience, but more so for that audience that has been so vocal in wanting another movie.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe Daily Mail later reported that it was Cattrall\'s ""demands"" that put a stop to the project, claiming she insisted that Warner Bros. produce other movies she had in development before signing onto SATC 3. Cattrall denied the report on Twitter.\n\nWoke 2 a @MailOnline \xf0\x9f\x92\xa9storm! The only \'DEMAND\' I ever made was that I didn\'t want to do a 3rd film....& that was back in 2016 \xe2\x80\x94 Kim Cattrall (@KimCattrall) September 29, 2017\n\nCattrall then specifically called out Parker during an interview with Piers Morgan for ITV\'s Life Stories.\n\n""At this very moment, it\xe2\x80\x99s quite extraordinary to get any kind of negative press about something that I\xe2\x80\x99ve been saying for almost a year,"" she noted. ""This is really where I take to task the people from Sex and the City, specifically Sarah Jessica Parker, in that I think she could have been nicer,"" she expressed to Morgan. ""I really think she could have been nicer.""\n\n""I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what her issue is, I never have,"" she added.\n\nCattrall also said she was never friends with her SATC co-stars, including Cynthia Nixon and Kristin Davis.\n\n""We\xe2\x80\x98ve been colleagues and in some ways, it\xe2\x80\x99s a very healthy place to be because then you have a clear line between your professional life and relationship and your personal,"" she noted. ""They all have children and I am 10 years older, and since, specifically, the series ended, I have been spending most of my time outside of New York, so, I don\xe2\x80\x99t see them.

And it appears the cast is taking sides. Willie Garson -- who portrayed Stanford Blatch, the best friend of Carrie Bradshaw (Parker) in both the TV series and the movies -- posted a cryptic tweet in October that appeared to be aimed at Cattrall. Cattrall repeatedly denied that she ever considered doing a third SATC movie and further claimed that she never began contract negotiations.\n\n""Dear fans, because I\'m ""toxic,"" I\'m going to negotiate a contract for 6 months, not come to terms, then say I never wanted to do it anyway,\'"" he wrote.\n\nDear fans, because I\'m ""toxic"", I\'m going to negotiate a contract for 6 months, not come to terms, then say I never wanted to do it anyway. \xe2\x80\x94 Willie Garson \xf0\x9f\x87\xba\xf0\x9f\x87\xb8 (@WillieGarson) October 4, 2017\n\n6. Katy Perry vs. Taylor Swift\n\n\n\nGetty Images\n\nThe epic Katy Perry vs. Taylor Swift feud continued with the promotion of both their respective albums this year -- Perry\'s Witness and Swift\'s Reputation. Perry didn\'t hold back during her Carpool Karaoke segment with James Corden in June, addressing the beef head-on.\n\n""Honestly, it\'s really like she started it and it\'s time for her to finish it,"" Perry said after the Late Late Show host asked her to clear things up. ""She wouldn\'t speak to me. I do the right thing any time that it feels like a fumble. It was a full shutdown and then she writes a song about me and I\'m like, \'OK, cool, cool, cool. That\'s how you wanna deal with it?\'""\n\nIn an interview with NME, Perry gave background on why she decided to address the feud with Corden.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean, I\xe2\x80\x99m not Buddha -- things irritate me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI wish that I could turn the other cheek every single time, but I\xe2\x80\x99m also not a pushover, you know? Especially when someone tries to assassinate my character with little girls [her fans]. That\xe2\x80\x99s so messed up!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThough Swift stayed silent on Perry\'s comments about her, she let her actions do the talking. Swift surprisingly announced on June 8 that her entire catalog will return to all streaming services at midnight -- just when Perry\'s Witness dropped.\n\nSwift also took thinly veiled digs at Perry in her ""Look What You Made Me Do"" music video that dropped in August. Swift dresses up very similar to Perry in the shade-filled video and gets into a car crash -- a moment that looks very close to the accident in Perry\'s ""Unconditionally"" music video. She also pointedly holds a GRAMMY, highlighting that she has 10 accolades, while Perry has zero.\n\nLater, Swift is in a vault, robbing a bank and wearing a sweatshirt that features a glittery tiger, along with a cat mask, seemingly mocking the name of Perry\'s fanbase, KatyCats.\n\nYouTube\n\n7. Caitlyn Jenner vs. The Kardashians\n\nGetty Images\n\nCaitlyn Jenner\'s relationship with the Kardashian family deteriorated after the August release of her memoir, The Secret of My Life, which didn\'t exactly paint the Kardashians in a positive light. Kris Jenner claimed on Keeping Up With the Kardashians that Caitlyn\'s stories about her were ""all made up.""\n\n""My mom has been so fair to Cait, and Cait just has no decency towards my mom whatsoever,"" Kim Kardashian West later told KUWTK cameras, clearly siding with her mother. ""I feel like my mom is carrying this burden and feeling like she had to maintain a relationship with Caitlyn for all the kids. But we\'re grown up. I don\'t think my mom has to try anymore. It\'s time to move on.""\n\nIn September, Caitlyn said she hadn\'t spoken to Kris or Kim since the book\'s release.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI went overboard to be nice, to be friendly, to be open, but also tell my story and my side of the story,\xe2\x80\x9d Caitlyn said during an appearance on Good Morning Britain. \xe2\x80\x9cSince the book came out, I\xe2\x80\x99ve never talked to Kris again. Kim, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t talked to in six, nine months, whatever it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n""It\xe2\x80\x99s unfortunate, because actually Kim was the first one I talked to about this issue,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued. ""She was very straightforward with me. She\xe2\x80\x99s been very, very good on it. It\xe2\x80\x99s a big loss in my life, not having her there anymore. To me, I mean, that\xe2\x80\x99s sad.""\n\nCurrently, the relationship is showing no signs of repair.\n\nThe I Am Cait star spoke to students at Cambridge Union in England in November, where amid discussing her 2015 transition and its aftermath, she revealed that she and Kim haven\'t spoken in ""a year.""\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s been a little bit tough over the last couple of years on the Kardashian side,"" Caitlyn acknowledged. ""To be honest, I don\'t talk to them anymore. Kim, I haven\'t talked to in a year.""\n\n""They don\'t want me in their lives, they bashed me pretty badly,"" she continued. ""It\'s devastating when your kids do that. It really hurt.""\n\n8. Drake Bell vs. Josh Peck\n\nGetty Images\n\nThe state of the Drake & Josh co-stars\' friendship made headlines in June, when Bell made it clear he was upset that he wasn\'t invited to Peck\'s wedding to Paige O\'Brien. Although Bell wasn\'t present at the ceremony, Peck\'s Grandfathered co-star, John Stamos, was, as well as Jason Nash, whom Peck also acted with on Drake & Josh.\n\nIn now deleted tweets, Bell made his feelings known.\n\n""When you\'re not invited to the wedding the message is clear\xe2\x80\xa6"" Bell tweeted. ""Loyalty is key\xe2\x80\xa6 ALWAYS remember where you came from.""\n\n""True colors have come out today,"" he added. ""Message is loud and clear. Ties are officially cut. I\'ll miss ya brotha.""\n\nFor his part, Peck made it clear that he no longer had a close relationship with Bell during his appearance on the Allegedly with Theo Von & Matthew Cole Weiss podcast.\n\nET spoke to Bell in July, when he explained the emotional tweets.\n\n""We\'ve been together 18 years, Josh and me, me and Josh,"" Bell shared. ""We\'ve been so close, it was just one of those things where, you know, I\'d been talking to him, and he\'s been telling me about the engagement. And then I saw on social media, the wedding, and I didn\'t hear about it. So, it was just one of those things where it was just like, \'You didn\'t even tell me?! I had to find out on social media?\' And then you\'re like, \'You know what!? Fine!\' and then I\'m like, wait, I probably shouldn\'t have done that.""\n\n""Yeah, I said the ties are cut or whatever, but I should have just texted that to him, you know,"" he continued. ""I was just being cranky.""\n\nTo solidify that the two had no hard feelings, they later reunited at the MTV VMAs in August.\n\n9. Justin Bieber vs. Marilyn Manson\n\n\n\nMatt Winkelmeyer, Kevin Mazur/Getty Images\n\nOne of the most bizarre feuds of the year was between pop star Justin Bieber and goth rocker Marilyn Manson. During an interview with Billboard in September, Manson said he confronted Bieber at a bar when he saw that the ""Sorry"" singer was selling shirts with Manson\'s face on the front and Bieber\'s name on the back, as part of his official Purpose World Tour merchandise.\n\n""I saw a little girl in a pink hoodie with blond hair, and it turns out to be Bieber. I sit down, and I say, \'Hey, so you wore my shirt and everything onstage,\'"" Manson recalled. ""He was one of those touchy people that hit you when they talk, and he comes up to about d**k height. Then he goes, \'I made you relevant again.\'""\n\nManson said he got revenge by not showing up to a planned duet between the two at Bieber\xe2\x80\x99s show that he suggested.\n\n""I reply, \'That was a great idea you had about doing [my song] \'The Beautiful People\' at your show at Staples Center tomorrow.\' And he goes, \'Yeah, it was,\' not knowing that I told him an idea that I had just made up,"" Manson shared. ""His tour manager sat down, and I asked, \'What time is sound check tomorrow? What time should I be there? Because we\xe2\x80\x99re going to do \'Beautiful People.\xe2\x80\x99 Obviously, when 4 p.m. rolled around the next day, I just didn\'t show.""\n\nManson later claimed Bieber apologized to him through text during Manson\xe2\x80\x99s appearance on Howard Stern\'s Sirius XM show.\n\nQuoting Bieber\xe2\x80\x99s supposed texts, Manson read, \xe2\x80\x9cHonestly, I totally thought we hit it off. My bad. If I was an a**hole, it wasn\'t my intention.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n""I don\'t really care about the media,"" Manson continued to read from Bieber\'s supposed texts. ""I just wanna make sure you and I were good. \xe2\x80\x98Cause I like you.""\n\nManson further reflected on their feud.\n\n""He sassed me and he apologized,"" Manson explained. ""And I said I wouldn\'t s**t talk him, so I wouldn\'t s**t talk him.""\n\n'"

"b'The gloves are off in the marital breakup of the decade. But who will win in the battle of celebrity leaks and lawyers?\n\nCelebrity marriages have not had the best of times: Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard, Gwen Stefani and Gavin Rossdale. Middle-aged, male A-list stars are taking a beating. The situation has become so dire that the celebrity news channel E! Online is predicting the \xe2\x80\x9cEnd of an era for celebrity idol worship\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\nBut nothing quite prepared the celebrity world for the totalling of Brangelina.\n\nBrad Pitt: FBI evaluating whether to investigate airplane incident Read more\n\nFrom alimony to palimony to the rise of the pay-as-you-go marriage (the wage-earning party to pay into a separation fund throughout the length of the marriage so there are no surprises when or if the marriage eventually ends), Hollywood couples have long been pioneers when it comes to marital innovation, but the end of Brad Pitt/Angelina Jolie has left a nuclear pall over Hollywood-land.\n\nThe normally loquacious PR Howard Bragman, known for containing tabloid feeding frenzies, offered no advice. \xe2\x80\x9cJust sad to me,\xe2\x80\x9d he wrote in an email.\n\nIn some instances, say managers, both parties should be able to walk away with their careers and box-office potential enhanced. But the Brangelina marriage crack-up already looks to be heading in the opposite direction, with reports of the FBI looking into \xe2\x80\x9can incident\xe2\x80\x9d on a flight the Pitt-Jolie family took on 14 September.\n\nPitt was reportedly \xe2\x80\x9clawyering up\xe2\x80\x9d after the FBI announced the agency \xe2\x80\x9cis continuing to gather facts and will evaluate whether an investigation at the federal level will be pursued\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis one is going to end with both of them having their images bruised,\xe2\x80\x9d predicts Allison Hope Weiner, a lawyer and journalist who has covered Hollywood for more than 15 years.\n\nWhat is clear is that in this confrontation nothing is left to chance and the leaks that appear in the media \xe2\x80\x93 usually via celebrity website TMZ\xe2\x80\x99s host Harvey Levin, are deliberate and highly strategised.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey know that if they can get to Harvey first, and he publishes first, they can set the tone because the rest of the media consider TMZ a first-party source,\xe2\x80\x9d says one talent manager familiar with the frontlines of Hollywood scandal. \xe2\x80\x9cAngelina needs some kind of leverage to go for full custody for the kids.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you\xe2\x80\x99re wise enough you can see that websites like TMZ granulate \xe2\x80\x93 serialise \xe2\x80\x93 everything because it creates entertainment product for them to carry it. They\xe2\x80\x99re making money off it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s no mystery, then, that barely a week into the split, the children are already the focus of the battle.

One source told People magazine: \xe2\x80\x9cHe was appealing to her to do this quietly \xe2\x80\x93 not to save the marriage but to consider the wellbeing of the children \xe2\x80\x93 and it was ignored.

In some cases, nannies are instructed to walk in the back so parents can be photographed with their children and look as if they have no professional help with parenting.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMoreover, paparazzi are informed when to catch parents out at the park with their children, providing an opportunity for the star to be photographed \xe2\x80\x98spending quality time\xe2\x80\x99 with his or her child.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHow Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt defined the 21st-century fame machine Read more\n\nCould a celebrity divorce ever be harnessed to engineer a career lift?

With Kelly as a long-standing host, it would make sense to keep her around.\n\nRyan, however, is likely expendable.\n\nKelly has been known in the past to not get along with her co-hosts, and if recent reports to be believed, she is not getting along with Ryan.\n\nAnother thing probably irks Ryan is that ABC is rebooting American Idol and he's very busy with Live.

"b'Cheryl has admitted that her statement announcing her split from Liam Payne was ""so cringeworthy,"" but that she and the One Direction singer ""don\'t hate each other"". Her candid comments came to light after Piers Morgan revealed the pair had texted each other, after Piers covered the break-up on Good Morning Britain earlier this month. On the show, he said: ""It\'s always weird when celebrity couples split up saying they have so much love for each other. If they love each other that much, why are they splitting up? They should be more honest and just say, \'We hate each other.\'""\n\nIn his latest column for the Daily Mail\'s Event magazine, Piers revealed that Cheryl texted him after the broadcast to share her feelings.

"b'After nine months of fan speculation and hiding from the spotlight, Kylie Jenner finally revealed baby Stormi to the world. Like most celebrities, we expected Kylie to get back into shape quickly with a healthy diet and exercise. But shortly after, photos reveal just how fast she dropped the pounds \xe2\x80\x94 and we\xe2\x80\x99re all wondering whether it\xe2\x80\x99s healthy.\n\nSo, what\xe2\x80\x99s Kylie\xe2\x80\x99s weight-loss secret? Here\xe2\x80\x99s how she managed to lose a reported 25 pounds in just two weeks. Medical experts also provide a warning for Kylie and other mothers (page 7).\n\n1. Kylie allegedly follows Kim K\xe2\x80\x99s advice and eats super clean\n\nDuring her pregnancy, Kylie admitted to having an obsession with In-N-Out fast food, Insider notes. That\xe2\x80\x99s a serious departure from the way she currently eats, however. And thanks to Kim Kardashian, Kylie is getting one-on-one advice on how to drop excess fat and get into shape fast post-pregnancy.\n\nThe Independent says Kim advised Kylie to stick to a strict 1,500 calorie-a-day diet, according to one source. Along with that, Kim suggested Kylie eats no carbs or sugar, despite her \xe2\x80\x9caddiction\xe2\x80\x9d to fast food.\n\nNext: Kylie has been a fan of this dangerous weight-loss method for a while.\n\n2. She may be a fan of \xe2\x80\x98detox teas\xe2\x80\x99\n\nA source says in addition to a very strict diet, Kylie is drinking \xe2\x80\x9cdetox teas\xe2\x80\x9d to help drop pounds, reports Hollywood Life. This wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be Kylie\xe2\x80\x99s first attempt at weight loss with these teas, either. She posted a photo of her holding two of her favorite detox formulas on Instagram and promoting their cleansing effects.\n\nHere\xe2\x80\x99s the problem, though: Teas don\xe2\x80\x99t actually have the ability to \xe2\x80\x9cdetox\xe2\x80\x9d your body. And drinking them won\xe2\x80\x99t automatically help you lose weight, either, though some do have a laxative effect. In this case, you\xe2\x80\x99ll just lose water weight.\n\nNext: This is how Kylie prefers to train.\n\n3. When she works out, she incorporates weight training\n\nThough sister Khloe has accused Kylie of not putting much work into her body in the past, those days are seemingly over for the young Jenner. Hollywood Life notes one insider reveals the new mom hits the gym for a mix of cardio and weight lifting. She\xe2\x80\x99s reportedly a big fan of running, squats, and push-ups to get that pre-baby body back.\n\nThe insider also says Kylie works out with a personal trainer five days a week for up to three hours a day. If this is the case, she could be leading up to serious burnout in the future, which can hinder her results in the long run.\n\nNext: Could it be true that Kylie is sticking to a diet this low in calories?\n\n4. Kylie sticks to an extremely calorie-restricted diet, some sources say\n\nKim might advise a 1,500 calorie-a-day diet, but could Kylie be going to even bigger extreme? The Inquisitr says one insider mentions Kylie\xe2\x80\x99s eating as little as 1,000 calories a day. They also said sometimes the starlet will just eat soup in the early evening as a meal replacement. And of course, this combined with no carbs or sugary sweets is sure to cause massive weight loss, even if it\xe2\x80\x99s not sustainable.\n\nThe source says it gets even more severe than this, too. Allegedly, Kylie bans anyone from eating junk food around her, so she\xe2\x80\x99s not tempted.\n\nNext: Kylie might go overboard quickly with her regimen.\n\n5. Some say she wants to look even thinner than she did pre-pregnancy\n\nInStyle explains pre-pregnancy, Kylie was around 136 pounds, which is perfect for her 5-foot-6 frame. During her pregnancy, however, she gained upward of 50 pounds. And now, the Inquisitr notes one source says she wants to be even thinner than she was before baby Stormi was ever in the picture.\n\nRush reports Kylie was right in the \xe2\x80\x9cnormal\xe2\x80\x9d weight range at 136, so she shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t aim to go too far under this number. We\xe2\x80\x99ll have to see how extreme she goes with her regimen \xe2\x80\x94 though hopefully she\xe2\x80\x99ll make healthy adjustments.\n\nNext: Some think this is the reason Kylie\xe2\x80\x99s losing weight so quickly.\n\n6. Others say the weight is falling off naturally due to genetics\n\nIs it possible Kylie\xe2\x80\x99s not really partaking in extreme dieting after all, and the weight is falling off due to good genes? That\xe2\x80\x99s what one source tells Hollywood Life. They told the publication that \xe2\x80\x9cher biggest weight loss secret is breastfeeding and good genetics. She has always had a great metabolism and breastfeeding has kicked it into high gear.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nCould it be true that the young Jenner isn\xe2\x80\x99t going to any extremes after all? Maybe so. And for more drama, the source also mentions Kim\xe2\x80\x99s jealous the pounds are coming off so easily for Kylie after her own personal struggles with baby weight.\n\nNext: Should Kylie lose weight this fast? Experts weigh in.\n\n7. Here\xe2\x80\x99s what medical experts believe Kylie should be doing post-pregnancy\n\nDr. Elizabeth Ward tells WebMD all about weight gain and loss before and after pregnancy. Ward says a woman at an average weight should expect to gain between 25 and 35 pounds, and they should also work to lose that excess weight after a year of having the baby. For at least six weeks postpartum, however, she suggests focusing on a healthy diet instead of cutting calories.\n\nWard also warns new mothers against following celebrity fad diets to lose weight quickly. Good nutrition, sleep, and physical activity are all vital for keeping energy levels up to take care of a newborn. And restricting calories if you\xe2\x80\x99re a nursing mom will affect breast milk quality.\n\nNext: How is motherhood treating Kylie?\n\n8. Doing it all\n\nThough many folks were shocked when word of Jenner\xe2\x80\x99s pregnancy hit the internet, according to a video that documented her pregnancy, she\xe2\x80\x99s always wanted to be a mother. In fact, before baby Stormi\xe2\x80\x99s arrival, the entrepreneur wanted to do everything for her daughter herself.\n\nA source told People, \xe2\x80\x9cAt first, she only wants [mom Kris Jenner] and her sisters to help with the baby. She is worried about new people around the baby.\xe2\x80\x9d Considering how protective Jenner was of herself and her baby during her pregnancy, we can certainly see why she wanted to keep folks at bay.\n\nNext: A good team\n\n9. Seamless co-parenting\n\nIn addition to her family, Jenner also has the help of her boyfriend and Stormi\xe2\x80\x99s dad, rapper Travis Scott. Apparently, the young couple has already mastered co-parenting, at least for this stage in their baby daughter\xe2\x80\x99s life.\n\nAn insider told People, \xe2\x80\x9cKylie and Travis are a good team. Travis is able to do his own thing during the day as well, but he helps Kylie out at night. He has cut down on work and only has a few shows coming up.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNext: Motherly advice\n\n10. Getting advice from mama\n\nBecause Jenner\xe2\x80\x99s mother, Kris Jenner, has six children of her own and a slew of grandchildren, it would only seem natural that her youngest daughter would reach out to her for advice. According to Cosmopolitan, the \xe2\x80\x9cmomager\xe2\x80\x9d has been a major help for the new mom.\n\nA source told the magazine, \xe2\x80\x9cKris has been spending a lot of time at Kylie\xe2\x80\x99s house since she came home with Stormi. Kylie has been a natural at being a mother. However, it has been overwhelming, and Kylie has relied on Kris during these first days at home with Stormi. Kris is providing advice and, of course, an extra set of hands to help with Stormi.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNext: A ton of big changes\n\n11. Feeling a little overwhelmed\n\nThough Jenner is obviously obsessed with her daughter, she also felt pretty overwhelmed after Stormi\xe2\x80\x99s birth. As a result, it appears that the socialite has decided to hire a nurse to help assist her with Stormi\xe2\x80\x99s care. After all, Kris Jenner has a thriving business herself and can\xe2\x80\x99t be around for everything.\n\nA source told People,\xe2\x80\x9cShe knows she can\xe2\x80\x99t rely on [mom Kris Jenner] every day and hired some help for the baby. Kris is helping out as much as she can, but she also runs a business and has her own life.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNext: Self-care\n\n12. Time for herself\n\nEven though she\xe2\x80\x99s now hired help, Jenner has only been seen twice in public since giving birth to Stormi. However, the Lip Kit creator seems to understand the importance of taking care of herself. You cannot take care of anyone if you aren\xe2\x80\x99t your best self.\n\nAn insider revealed to People, \xe2\x80\x9cKylie is feeling great and likes leaving the house for short outings.\xe2\x80\x9d So far the paparazzi has spotted her leaving a meeting with her bestie, model Jordyn Woods, and heading to a friend\xe2\x80\x99s baby shower.\n\nNext: Staying out of the spotlight\n\n13. The importance of privacy\n\nIf there is one thing we know about the Kardashian-Jenner clan, it\xe2\x80\x99s that they are obsessed with the spotlight. However, Jenner surprised us all when she was pregnant with Stormi. Protecting herself and the energy around her, she decided to keep her pregnancy under wraps until after she gave birth.\n\nShe explained in her pregnancy journey video, \xe2\x80\x9cI understand you\xe2\x80\x99re used to me bringing you along on all my journeys. my pregnancy was one I chose not to do in front of the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThough Jenner has been more open since Stormi\xe2\x80\x99s birth, it seems like her privacy policy concerning her daughter will be in effect for a while longer. An insider told US Weekly, \xe2\x80\x9cShe is extremely protective, and she is very focused on trying to keep motherhood private for right now. She used to love being in the limelight, but that has totally changed. All Kylie wants is for her privacy to be protected right now and [she] is pretty demanding about that at this time.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNext: Taking it all in\n\n14. A happy little family\n\nIt seems like with Scott, an extra set of hands, and her family at her side, the youngest Jenner is getting a hang of motherhood.\n\nA source told People, \xe2\x80\x9cKylie and Travis are not officially living together. They are co-parenting though, and things are going great. They are together and happy. They\xe2\x80\x99re just enjoying their little family. [Travis Scott is] very sweet with his daughter.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAdditional reporting by Aramide Tinubu.\n\nCheck out The Cheat Sheet on Facebook!'"

An insider reveals the shocking details from Tristan\xe2\x80\x99s hookups with a curvy stunner last November and again in February.\n\nTristan hit on the woman at an NYC club following a November game against the New York Knicks.

He got out first and had her circle the block a few times before coming up to his room, where they had unprotected sex.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe slept with him because he\xe2\x80\x99s an NBA star, but she thinks he\xe2\x80\x99s hot, too,\xe2\x80\x9d the insider says. \xe2\x80\x9cShe said that the sex was good.\xe2\x80\x9d So good, the woman stayed the night and took a short video of Tristan \xe2\x80\x94 identifiable by his distinctive chest tattoos \xe2\x80\x94 asleep in bed afterward, which the source shared exclusively with In Touch.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was definitely not careful at all about making sure that nobody knew who she was or that she didn\xe2\x80\x99t have her phone,\xe2\x80\x9d adds the source. In the video, two phones are visible on the nightstand. The source says they\xe2\x80\x99re both Tristan\xe2\x80\x99s, adding, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s so sketchy.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIn the morning, they swapped numbers for a potential round two. And the woman heard from Tristan right away \xe2\x80\x94 but he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t looking for another hookup.

Out of the blue, Tristan texted the woman and invited her to see his team play in another city in February. \xe2\x80\x9cHe paid for her flight,\xe2\x80\x9d says the source. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd she slept over again.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nFor more on this exclusive story, pick up the new issue of In Touch magazine, on newsstands now!'"
"b'After wrapping up the schedule of Avengers: Infinity War, Josh Brolin has taken over the role of Cable from Deadpool 2. The actor, who will be playing Cable alongside Ryan Reynolds in the Deadpool sequel, began his preparation for the role some months ago.\n\nPosting pictures from his workout sessions, the actor has been actively showing off his body transformation on social media platforms. However, the stunning transformation has raised a few eyebrows. Is Brolin taking the help of steroids for his Deadpool role?\n\nA new article by Star claims that the actor is on steroids to beef up for his role in the X-Men movie. Shocked? The report speculates that he is on ""steroids or some type of supplements"" that is helping him build up so quickly. ""It\'s almost unbelievable that someone could build that kind of muscle so quickly,"" the report suggested.\n\nHowever, Gossip Cop has taken a step to clarify the doubt and confirm that the actor is indeed clean. The actor once posted about his diet, expressing his disappointment of staying away from carbs like bread, pasta and other similar food products.\n\nReassuring that he is still on the same diet and away from drugs, a source close to Brolin confirmed to the website, ""Totally clean: no sugar, no breads, no pastas, no drugs, none of it. Fish, rice, eggs, veggies, water.""\n\nThe source also asked fans to take a look at his workout videos if they need to see his ongoing transformations. The actor has posted most of his training videos on his Instagram account.\n\nWhile this does clarify that the actor is off drugs, steroid usage in Hollywood is not a new subject of discussion. Actors from Christian Bale to Tom Hardy, Hugh Jackman and head of them all, Sylvester Stallone, have been accused of taking the needle to beef up within a matter of a few weeks.\n\nA report published by The Hollywood Reporter in 2013 also suggests that about 20 percent of actors use PEDs to bulk up. The exact percentage of the actors taking help from steroids is not known yet.\n\nThe filming of the movie has begun. Deadpool 2 releases on June 1, 2018.'"
"b'Beyonce is pregnant with twins, as everybody on the planet knows by now. And according to a new report, Beyonce also wants to built a million dollar nursery for these twins. Okay, actually, Beyonce and Jay-Z want to build this nursery. But let\xe2\x80\x99s be real \xe2\x80\x93 if Beyonce wants something, you think Jay-Z is going to say no?\n\nAnd also, when was the last time we saw Jay-Z claiming to want something, and Beyonce jumping on that bandwagon? And don\xe2\x80\x99t say a divorce #neverforgetthelevatorincident. Anyway, Radar\xe2\x80\x99s source claims, \xe2\x80\x9cBeyonce told Jay Z she wants a million-dollar nursery in her home! The place will have two of everything. It must have two lamps, changing tables, cribs, stuffed animals and a closet stocked with baby designer duds from Lanvin and Hermes\xe2\x80\xa6. money is no object. It has to be perfect.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWell, duh to that last part. \xe2\x80\x98Money is no object\xe2\x80\x99, as though that even needed to be stated. Truthfully, the fact that this is news is somewhat mind boggling. Why does the fact that Beyonce wants a fancy, expensive nursery need to become a thing? In fact, it would have been more news-worthy had Beyonce NOT wanted a million dollar nursery? Have you SEEN Blue Ivy\xe2\x80\x99s clothes?!\n\nThe more interesting part of this report is the fact that Beyonce \xe2\x80\x98told\xe2\x80\x99 Jay-Z she wants a million dollar nursery, not that Jay-Z is \xe2\x80\x98enthusiastic\xe2\x80\x99 about a million dollar nursery. Again, what Beyonce wants, Beyonce gets. But the phrasing of this report is definitely curious; it was alleged for a while that Jay-Z and Beyonce were still biding their time to announce a separation, or at least, a trial separation \xe2\x80\x93 and then bam, the announcement that came instead was that Beyonce was pregnant with twins. It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to believe that everything is suddenly hunky dory just because Beyonce is pregnant now.\n\nIf anything, the problems between the two are likely amplified, but we\xe2\x80\x99re not hearing anything because Beyonce shut down the leaks in her camp. And now, we\xe2\x80\x99ll hear only what she wants us to hear \xe2\x80\x93 like the fact that she wants a fancy nursery for her twins.\n\nImage Credit: FameFlynet'"
"b'My pregnancies, apart from the unplanned C-sections, were normal and uneventful. And I went through all the things the vast majority of postpartum women experience (Kate too, probably): vaginal bleeding, uterine cramps, engorged breasts, raging hormones, soreness, exhaustion, constipation and the general condition of feeling as if you\xe2\x80\x99ve been run over by a truck.\n\nI have three kids: twins the first time (one born vaginally, the second, four hours later, by Cesarean section) and a singleton (also by Cesarean section) after 16 hours of labor and two hours of unsuccessful pushing.\n\nThe internet exploded. Some women pronounced the Duchess superhuman. Others offered blunt comparisons to their own postpartum conditions. Mercifully, most seemed to realize Kate\xe2\x80\x99s seemingly supernatural ability to bounce back is not normal . But by focusing so much on her flawless appearance, we are distracted from the real trauma, physical and emotional, that is the childbirth experience.\n\nSeven hours after giving birth to her third child in less than five years, Kate Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge, stood before the media \xe2\x80\x94 in heels and a cherry red Jenny Packham dress -- cradling her darling new prince.\n\nBut we don\xe2\x80\x99t like to talk about these things. And we definitely don\xe2\x80\x99t like to talk about the longer term physical struggles many postpartum women endure: urinary and fecal incontinence, acute pelvic pain, back pain, muscle tears, hairline fractures, prolapsed bladder, pain during sex (if one can even summon the desire: low sex drive is another unpleasant side effect) and the \xe2\x80\x9cmummy tummy\xe2\x80\x9d (medically known as diastasis recti), what happens when a woman\xe2\x80\x99s abdomen stretches and separates to accommodate a growing fetus, but fails to knit itself back together. Many of these symptoms don\xe2\x80\x99t appear immediately, and because these topics are not often talked about, women often assume symptoms are just the new normal.\n\nWomen\xe2\x80\x99s health is the most popular of political footballs (to some people, it\xe2\x80\x99s still a pre-existing condition to be a woman), and it\xe2\x80\x99s also the most stigmatized. The female genitalia, in particular, is a gray area, a taboo even, something referred to as \xe2\x80\x9cdown there\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cprivate parts\xe2\x80\x9d or, if you\xe2\x80\x99re Oprah, \xe2\x80\x9cvajayjay.\xe2\x80\x9d The pelvic floor \xe2\x80\x94 the hammock of muscles that hold a woman\xe2\x80\x99s bladder, bowel and uterus where they belong \xe2\x80\x94 isn\xe2\x80\x99t visible, like a quad muscle, and it can be hard for women to pinpoint areas of discomfort. Most people don\xe2\x80\x99t even know what a pelvis looks like, apart from a skeleton they\xe2\x80\x99ve seen during Halloween.\n\nDonna Chiao, DPT, an orthopedic and pelvic health physical therapist, holds a model pelvis. (Courtesy of the author)\n\nBut a significant number of women, more than half by some counts, experience pelvic injury or dysfunction as a result of childbirth.\n\nThink about the women you know who joke about wetting their pants just a little bit when they laugh (one in three report urinary incontinence after childbirth), or resign themselves to pain during sex (that\xe2\x80\x99s about one-third of all women too), or just assume a lumpy tummy \xe2\x80\x94 as my kids so lovingly called mine \xe2\x80\x94 is part of motherhood.\n\nNot enough women know they can resolve some, if not all, of these issues with physical therapy.\n\nAfter the birth of my third child, I was eager to get back to my regular running routine. When my OBGYN gave me the \xe2\x80\x98all clear\xe2\x80\x99 at my postpartum appointment, I vowed to start back slowly, running for a minute, then walking for a minute, to regain my strength and stamina.\n\nAfter a few jogs, I was hobbling around, worried that my insides might fall out and splatter against the pavement.\n\nI called my doctor, the very one who gave me the green light. She recommended a couple of places for women\xe2\x80\x99s specific physical therapy, but the waitlist at Mt. Auburn Hospital, where I delivered, was 45 names long \xe2\x80\x94 so long they weren\xe2\x80\x99t even willing to add my name to the queue. I was eventually able to get an appointment with an outstanding women\xe2\x80\x99s health therapist at Marathon Sports in Newton, but I had to wait six weeks for my first appointment.\n\nMy experience isn\xe2\x80\x99t uncommon. There are more women who need help than specialists who can provide care. (At Marathon, the average wait is four to six months.) Part of the scarcity of care has to do with the extensive clinical training pelvic floor specialists need to do internal pelvic exams. My PT, Donna Chiao, completed seven years of education beyond high school, not including all the continuing education courses she had to take after receiving her doctorate. She told me that anything regarding the pelvic floor is rarely taught as part of the standard physical therapy curriculum, even in doctoral degree programs.'"

(Selena\'s no alcoholic)\n\nSpeaking to Gossip Cop, Mandy Teefey wants to clear things up. First, she talks about Selena\'s battle with Lupus.\n\n""When you are young, you feel invincible and she had to learn that she was not able to be your typical 20 year old.""\n\nThat is so sad. But, of course, Mandy is so glad that Selena received a life-saving kidney transplant.\n\n""Beyond blessed that we had Francia in our life,"" she said.\n\nFrancia Raisa made a truly powerful, selfless choice. And a dangerous one. Having a kidney removed is no joke.\n\nMandy says that, during the surgery, she was a ""wreck inside not only for my daughter, but for Francia and her family.""\n\nOf course. That had to be a weird feeling. And, understandably, Mandy was very, very emotional throughout the ordeal.\n\n""I am pretty sure I am banned from that hospital [now].""\n\nThat\'s a lot of nice stuff about Francia, but ... how does Mandy describe Selena?\n\n""Brave and fearless.""\n\nAbsolutely. To share her struggle with Lupus with the world, to share the news of her kidney transplant surgery, is a big deal.\n\nBut living her life every day, to the fullest, the way that Selana does is truly an act of courage.\n\n""I was so proud of her bravery.""\n\nRemember, folks -- that kidney transplant wasn\'t a cure. Lupus has treatments, but no cure. And Selena\'s case of Lupus seems to be especially severe.\n\nSo, now that she\'s being directly interviewed, how does Mandy feel about Selena\'s latest reunion with the Biebs?\n\n""Not happy.""\n\nThat much, we knew, but it sure would have been interesting if Mandy were pretending that it\'s totally fine.\n\n""Selena can live her life however she wants as long as she is happy, safe, and healthy.""\n\nThose are some very reasonable caveats.\n\nBut the relationship that she describes having with Selena isn\'t exactly the feud that we\'ve been hearing about.\n\n""Every mother and daughter has disagreements.""\n\nAnd Mandy denies that her relationship with her daughter began to crumble in 2014 when she stopped being Selena\'s manager.\n\nWe\'d heard reports that Selena\'s reunion with Bieber was just one source of conflict.\n\n""We never expected to manage her her whole life. We lost family time because the only time we saw her, we talked business.""\n\nWe were going to say that sounds like no fun, but Mandy beat us to it.\n\n""It was no longer fun for any of us, like it was when she was younger and we had to be with her because she was a minor.""\n\nMandy sounds determined to quash the feud rumors, saying of Selena:\n\n""She is 25 years old and knows what is at stake with her health. I do not control her the way it has been portrayed.""\n\nWell, surely no one really believed that Mandy was somehow giving her adult millionaire celebrity daughter a curfew.\n\n""Selena is an adult and can make her own choices.""\n\nThat\'s very true. We don\'t have to agree with Selena\'s choices in order to like her, folks.'"

Simpson, according to Entertainment Tonight.\n\nAs Kim explains in the upcoming premiere of Season 14 of \xe2\x80\x9cKeeping Up With the Kardashians,\xe2\x80\x9d she\xe2\x80\x99s upset that Caitlyn wrote that their attorney father knew O.J. Simpson was guilty of double murder but defended him anyway to get back at their mother Kris Jenner.\n\nIn her memoir \xe2\x80\x9cSecrets of My Life,\xe2\x80\x9d Caitlyn said Robert was jealous that Kris had moved on so quickly after their divorce by marrying the Olympic gold medalist then known as Bruce Jenner.\n\nAccording to Caitlyn\xe2\x80\x99s book, Robert knew it would upset Kris for him to join the defense team for Simpson in his trial on charges of murdering his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman. That\xe2\x80\x99s because Kris had been close friends with Nicole and knew that O.J. had been violent towards her.\n\nIn a clip for Sunday night\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cKUWTK,\xe2\x80\x9d Kim reads to Kourtney and Khloe excerpts from Caitlyn\xe2\x80\x99s memoir.

As Bruce Jenner, Caitlyn was the patriarch of the Kardashian reality TV show. Caitlyn\xe2\x80\x99s coming out was featured on the show in a way that was praised as being respectful and informative on transgender issues.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have always had Caitlyn\xe2\x80\x99s back,\xe2\x80\x9d Kardashian says to her sisters in the clip. \xe2\x80\x9cbut she is a liar. She is not a good person.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ron Goldman were found stabbed to death outside Nicole\xe2\x80\x99s condominium in the Brentwood area of Los Angeles on June 12, 1994.\n\nSimpson, the San Francisco-reared Heisman Trophy winner, former NFL star and celebrity pitchman, immediately became a person of their interest in their murders. On June 17, after the infamous low-speed pursuit of his white Ford Bronco SUV, he was arrested and charged with his killings. But he was acquitted in 1995.\n\nRobert was an original member of Simpson\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cdream team\xe2\x80\x9d of high-priced, high-profile attorneys. Throughout Simpson\xe2\x80\x99s arrest and trial, Robert remained a steady and loyal presence.\n\nBut Caitlyn believes a jealous love triangle motivated Robert\xe2\x80\x99s interest in helping his friend.\n\nRobert and Kris were married in 1978 and had four children together, future realty TV stars Kourtney, Kim, Khloe and Robert Jr. They divorced in 1991 and Kris immediately turned around and married Jenner, then a handsome, successful male athlete.\n\nIn her memoir Caitlyn wrote about Robert\xe2\x80\x99s sticking by Simpson: \xe2\x80\x9cI wonder if it was (Robert\xe2\x80\x99s) way of saying to her what I think she was saying to him when she married me: a big (expletive) you.\xe2\x80\x9d Reading this on your phone? Stay up to date with our free mobile app. Get it from the Apple app store or the Google Play store.\n\nCaitlyn contends that Robert knew his friend was guilty, based on a conversation Caitlyn had with Robert in the 1990s. Robert, who died of cancer in 2003, confessed his knowledge of O.J.\xe2\x80\x99s guilt during a car ride the two shared, Caitlyn claims. This would have been after O.J. was found liable for the deaths of Nicole and Ron Goldman in a 1998 civil trial.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would\xe2\x80\x99ve been okay with it if they had gotten him in the first trial,\xe2\x80\x9d Robert said, according to Caitlyn.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe implication was obvious that he believed O.J. was guilty,\xe2\x80\x9d Caitlyn wrote.\n\nKris and Caitlyn divorced in 2015 after Caitlyn went public with news she\xe2\x80\x99s transgender. Meanwhile, Simpson will be leaving a Nevada prison on parole next month after serving time for an unrelated robbery in Las Vegas.\n\nCaitlyn has acknowledged in interviews that she has a strained relationship with her ex-wife Kris Jenner and former Kardashian stepdaughters, though she maintains a connection with Kendall and Kylie Jenner, her daughters with Kris.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe relationship on the Kardashian side has been strained recently,\xe2\x80\x9d she admitted in an interview in August.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo be honest with you, I don\xe2\x80\x99t really talk to them. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t talked to them in months and months and months.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe upcoming episode of \xe2\x80\x9cKUWTK\xe2\x80\x9d won\xe2\x80\x99t be the first time Kim has spoken out against Caitlyn in recent weeks.

"b'Miranda Kerr was 18, just out of high school, a girl from the Australian countryside curious about what the rest of the world had to offer, when she first visited New Zealand. Along with a close friend from Gunnedah, the pastoral town where she grew up, Kerr set out to experience what for many is the draw of New Zealand: to escape and explore, to get a little lost and, in the process, get a little found. They slept in a tent. Swam in natural hot springs. Hiked terrain so raw and depopulated and expansive it felt as if they were the first humans to discover it. Kerr didn\xe2\x80\x99t know it at the time, but her life would change significantly in the years that followed, thanks largely to her enviable genetic gifts: the long pale legs, the shimmering doe eyes and, most famously, the pert, dimpled cheeks that have made her one of the highest paid, most recognizable models in the world. Modeling, for Kerr, has been its own sort of adventure, one she will be the first to acknowledge as a stroke of good fortune not to be taken for granted. \xe2\x80\x9cStill, that backpacking trip, just having that freedom, was one of the best times in my life,\xe2\x80\x9d Kerr recently reflected. \xe2\x80\x9cEver since, I\xe2\x80\x99ve wanted to get back to New Zealand.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nFor seven months, beginning last December, Kerr, 29, got her wish. She spent the majority of her nonworking time in Wellington, New Zealand\xe2\x80\x99s capital, where her husband, Orlando Bloom, was filming \xe2\x80\x9cThe Hobbit,\xe2\x80\x9d Peter Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s two-part prequel to the epic \xe2\x80\x9cThe Lord of the Rings\xe2\x80\x9d trilogy, the films that first made Bloom a star a decade ago. Wellington \xe2\x80\x94 or \xe2\x80\x9cWellywood,\xe2\x80\x9d as it\xe2\x80\x99s been christened since Jackson set up his studio empire in the suburb of Miramar \xe2\x80\x94 is one of the most remote capitals on the planet: some 28 hours by plane from London, 23 from New York, 15 from Los Angeles, 14 hours from Hong Kong and Tokyo. Of the city\xe2\x80\x99s many charms \xe2\x80\x94 its burgeoning restaurant scene, its absurdly picturesque scenery, the mellow Kiwi hospitality you experience everywhere you go \xe2\x80\x94 it is Wellington\xe2\x80\x99s physical isolation that makes it such a singular place. During the week I spent in the city, no matter what I was doing, even something as simple as sitting at a cafe sipping a flat white (New Zealand\xe2\x80\x99s richer version of a latte), I felt a palpable remove from the ways and rhythms of the rest of the world. (Being on the other side of the international date line helps.) So while much of Wellington could be compared to, say, Portland, Ore., or Seattle, there is the added seduction of being pleasantly unmoored, able to take in the pleasure of civilization while existing outside of it.\n\nThe circumstances of Kerr\xe2\x80\x99s stay in Wellington were, of course, quite different from her initial visit. She is now the mother of a cherubic young son, Flynn, 19 months, and the tent of her teen years was replaced by an airy, seaside mansion where every window looks out on Wellington Harbour. (The house, lent to the couple by one of the film\xe2\x80\x99s producers, happens to be where Bloom celebrated his 22nd birthday while filming \xe2\x80\x9cTLOTR.\xe2\x80\x9d) If she wanted to run an errand, or head to an afternoon Pilates class, a production assistant gave her a ride. Sweet perks, no question. And yet, to hear Kerr tell it, the life she and Bloom carved out in Wellington was in many ways a reminder of what existence was like before she became a celebrity, a kind of geographic escape hatch from the scrutiny of tabloids and the curious eyes of strangers. When they first arrived, for instance, they took a road trip that was reminiscent of her earlier journey: aimlessly driving around the countryside, out of reach and out of touch. \xe2\x80\x9cWe didn\xe2\x80\x99t camp because Flynn\xe2\x80\x99s still a little young for that,\xe2\x80\x9d Kerr told me. \xe2\x80\x9cBut it was just the three of us, nothing to do except be with each other in this shockingly beautiful place.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nKerr and I were having this conversation at Wellington\xe2\x80\x99s Botanic Garden, a sprawling expanse of lush floral curiosities, manicured lawns and shaded labyrinthine walkways offering some of the most extraordinary views of the city. It was hard to imagine that this was the same woman who, a few months earlier, had walked the runway in a $2.5 million bra while Maroon 5 performed at the Victoria\xe2\x80\x99s Secret fashion show; here, in raw-denim jeans and a loose navy sweater, she seemed no different from the other health-conscious young mothers who made up most of the gardens\xe2\x80\x99 visitors. Kerr had come from the set of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Hobbit,\xe2\x80\x9d which she visited most days with Flynn when Bloom, who was reprising his role as the bow-wielding elf Legolas, was working. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a cafeteria where everyone eats lunch, and they\xe2\x80\x99re all in full makeup,\xe2\x80\x9d Kerr said. \xe2\x80\x9cSo you see these poor Orcs\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 the demonic goblin soldiers of the film \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9ctrying to eat without ruining their costumes. For Orlando, it\xe2\x80\x99s easier. He just has the blond wig and the pointy ears.\xe2\x80\x9d'"

"b'LONDON -- The father of the former Meghan Markle says he talked politics with Prince Harry over the phone -- and Harry said he should give President Donald Trump a chance. Thomas Markle told broadcaster ITV on Monday that he had several phone conversations with Harry, including one in which the prince asked for permission to marry his daughter.\n\nMarkle said Mr. Trump was discussed at least once: ""Our conversation was I was complaining about not liking Donald Trump, he said \'give Donald Trump a chance\'. I sort of disagreed with that.""\n\nMarkle said he also asked his future son-in-law about Britain\'s 2016 decision to leave the European Union and got the impression Harry is comfortable with Brexit.\n\n""I think he was open to the experiment,"" Markle said.\n\nHarry\'s press office declined to comment on Markle\'s televised interview, which could raise eyebrows because senior royal figures are scrupulously careful not to comment publicly on domestic or international political affairs.\n\nGet Breaking News Delivered to Your Inbox\n\nMarkle, who had been scheduled to walk his daughter down the aisle, missed the royal wedding in May due to heart problems. He told ITV he was ""doing much better"" and that he regretted missing the big event.\n\nThe 73-year-old Markle, who watched the wedding from California, says he was ""very proud"" but that ""the unfortunate thing for me now is I\'m a footnote in one of the greatest moments in history rather than the dad walking her down the aisle.""\n\n""I can\'t think of a better replacement than someone like Prince Charles,"" he says of Prince Harry\'s own father, who walked Meghan most of the way down the aisle on her wedding day. ""He looked very handsome and my daughter looked beautiful with him. I was jealous, I wish I had been there, I wish it\'d been me. But thank God he was there and thank him for that.""\n\nHe says the couple, now known as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, will probably seek to have children soon.\n\n""She\'s wanted children for a long time,"" he said.\n\nMarkle said he gave Harry permission to marry his daughter over the phone.\n\n""Harry asked for her hand on the phone and I said: \'You are a gentleman, promise me you will never raise your hand against my daughter and of course I will grant you my permission.

"b'Rihanna is ... well, there\'s no real way to communicate with mere words how amazing Rihanna is.\n\nShe\'s beautiful, intelligent, talented, and just so many good things. There aren\'t enough hours in the day to sit down and count all of her virtues.\n\nShe\'s just the best, OK?\n\nAnd if you\'re a human being who walks this earth, then you surely know that.\n\nIt just makes sense that since Rihanna is such a treasure to us all, she\'s even more special to the men she dates -- and since last year, she\'s been dating billionaire Hassan Jameel.\n\nHassan is the deputy president and vice chairman of his family\'s company, which owns the rights to sell Toyota cars in Saudi Arabia.\n\nWe don\'t know much more about him, since he and Rihanna have been keeping their relationship very private.\n\nBut we do know that they\'ve been dating for close to a year now, and that they definitely seem serious about each other.\n\nSo that\'s nice, right? It\'s good to see Rihanna with someone who isn\'t an aggressive, violent, hateful, scary douchebag.\n\nAnd speaking of Chris Brown ...\n\nIt seems like while Chris isn\'t exactly an issue in Rihanna and Hassan\'s relationship, Hassan is concerned about him.\n\nA source tells Hollywood Life that ""He is uncomfortable with her ex Chris lurking in her past.""\n\nGee, wonder why?\n\n""Hassan doesn\'t trust Chris,"" the source adds, ""and he feels like he is unpredictable when it comes to Rihanna.""\n\n""He feels like Chris is capable of trying anything to win her back and that has him feeling uneasy. Hassan tries not to worry about Chris, but knowing he may still love Rihanna makes him feel a bit tense.""\n\nHis concerns may be valid -- another source claims that even after all this time and even though Rihanna has clearly moved on, Chris is still hung up on her.\n\n""Chris thinks Hassan is not good enough for Rihanna -- but then, nobody would be good enough for her in his eyes,"" this insider states.\n\nHe\'s including himself in that, right? He can\'t think that he\'s good enough for her. Right?!\n\n""He thinks there\'s no way Rihanna would marry this dude, which is kinda funny really as he doesn\'t know Hassan at all,"" the source continues.\n\n""Chris just can\'t help it though, even after all these years, and all the water that\'s passed under the bridge, he still loves Rihanna to pieces and he still thinks of her as being his girl.""\n\n""It\'s totally crazy, but Chris still holds out this belief that one day, somehow, he and Rihanna will get back together and live happily after,"" the insider concludes.\n\nNo wonder Hassan has some concerns.\n\nEspecially when Chris has referred to himself as a stalker in the past, and has made statements like ""If I love you, bitch, ain\'t nobody gonna have you, I\'m gonna make you miserable.""\n\nWe\'d say we don\'t have the best feeling about this, but we never have good feelings when it comes to Chris Brown.'"

"b'And now, there\xe2\x80\x99s her hugely anticipated single titled \xe2\x80\x9cWork.\xe2\x80\x9d It\xe2\x80\x99s about working for a paycheck no matter what else is going on in your life. It is also, of course, designed to get her that paycheck. You might call the way it goes about attaining this goal brazen for anyone else but Rihanna: Tempting accusations of boringness, hackiness, and crimes against art, the song offers a hook that practically parodies pop\xe2\x80\x99s love of repetition\xe2\x80\x94and then repeats it, a lot. But there\xe2\x80\x99s something fascinating about the tune, something that elevates it beyond ringtone status. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t really go anywhere. It approximates what work feels like.\n\nThe producer Boi-1da\xe2\x80\x99s bright, bubbly beat creates a see-sawing sensation out of a few sounds. A keyboard ping anchors the downbeat and then climbs up, up, down, down, returning to its starting point. Electronic notes on the low end burble out a more asymmetrical pattern recalling reggae, but they too have the general shape of ascending and descending. The percussion is subtle, rendered with a skittering sound that recalls the shaking of a kettle. When Rihanna\xe2\x80\x99s voice comes in, so do some signifiers of \xe2\x80\x9980s and \xe2\x80\x9990s dance and rap: digital handclaps, distorted shouting. It all adds up to the feeling of a lot of bustling in one spot\xe2\x80\x94activity, but not necessarily movement.\n\nRihanna\xe2\x80\x99s hook conjures a different kind of monotony. After a few quick notes in yet another up-and-back pattern, she gets stuck, like a needle in a groove, for \xe2\x80\x9cwork work work work work.\xe2\x80\x9d There\xe2\x80\x99s no stopping this getting in your head. \xe2\x80\x9cWork\xe2\x80\x9d becomes \xe2\x80\x9cdirt\xe2\x80\x9d becomes \xe2\x80\x9clove\xe2\x80\x9d becomes \xe2\x80\x9cturn,\xe2\x80\x9d but the modulations don\xe2\x80\x99t matter\xe2\x80\x94Rihanna has found her next great nonsense syllable, another \xe2\x80\x9cooh na na\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cella ella eh.\xe2\x80\x9d Her singing in the verses, where she dresses down some guy who isn\xe2\x80\x99t meeting her expectations, is actually rather pretty. I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a lot of commenters say she\xe2\x80\x99s copying the mumbling trend that\xe2\x80\x99s taken hold among younger pop vocalists like Ariana Grande, but the truth is that Rihanna helped popularize the notion of liquifying words in the name of catchiness.\n\nAs for Drake\xe2\x80\x99s verse, it strikes me as pretty terrible\xe2\x80\x94the disappointed lounge singer schtick from \xe2\x80\x9cHotline Bling,\xe2\x80\x9d but without the silken melody or sense of surprise. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you had a twin I would still choose you\xe2\x80\x9d is the only real attempt at a memorable line. Whatever. Drake being as popular as he is right now will be yet another incentive for radio playlist makers to keep this song in rotation, possibly giving it the activating energy needed to become a hit.\n\nAnd to be sure, it will need a good deal of exposure to reach the success levels of Rihanna\xe2\x80\x99s previous smashes. The song\xe2\x80\x99s undeniably catchy, but it also has a strangely unfinished quality. To me, though, that\xe2\x80\x99s its charm. The verses, choruses, and bridge mostly bleed into each other, forgoing soft-to-loud explosions or exciting rhythmic changes. Boi-1da does create some sense of escalation\xe2\x80\x94another drum beat for the second chorus, flashes of flutes, autotuned harmonies, and far-off piano. But the shifts are subtle and fleeting. Unlike a lot of radio pop, \xe2\x80\x9cWork\xe2\x80\x9d is about small modulations, a singer and a producer and a rapper plugging along as we all must do. At the end, the song makes the unfashionable move of simply fading out. Rihanna put in her three and a half minutes of work; now pay her what you owe her.\n\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.

"b'Even by Hollywood standards, she has always been slender.\n\nBut, with her size six trousers hanging loose over her hips, and not even the hint of a curve where once there was a perfectly sculpted alabaster cleavage, it is clear that Nicole Kidman has lost a disturbing amount of weight.\n\nEmerging from a yoga class in New York, the 36-year-old actress looked skinnier than she has ever been.\n\nAssociates say that, at 5ft 10in, she weighs only 8st 3lb.\n\nSeveral friends are concerned that she is dieting and exercising more than is healthy, and others wonder what can be behind the change.\n\nOne old friend, who remarked after embracing her recently that she was nothing but skin and bone, was told with a wan smile: ""Perhaps I have been overdoing it a little.""\n\nShe certainly takes vigorous exercise.\n\nExercising more than is healthy\n\nAs well as her regular yoga classes near her rented penthouse in the SoHo district, she swims and jogs often.\n\nRecently she was seen jogging in a tracksuit, hat and gloves in a temperature of 30c.\n\nAlthough her defenders say they have seen her dining on sea bass, or tucking in to chocolate ice cream, there are allegedly times when she prefers vegetable smoothies to a meal.\n\nCurrently her body mass index - expressing weight in relation to height - stands at just 16.\n\nThe healthy range is 20 to 25, and doctors become concerned if it drops below 18.\n\nShe is, then, clinically underweight.\n\nBecause she is so tall, the loss of 15lb since her marriage to Tom Cruise ended two-and-a-half years ago is clearly apparent.\n\nHer agents, however, talked last night about her being happy and healthy, and vigorously denied any suggestions of an eating disorder.\n\nCatherine Olim, her spokesman, said: ""Nicole has always been slender. Look at American Vogue, she is glorious. I don\'t know what the fuss is about.""\n\nThose protests are given credibility by a 40-page spread in the magazine she refers to, which hit newsstands this week.\n\nBut Valentino says her figure is perfect\n\nMiss Kidman looks stunning, posing in clothes by a string of designers.\n\n(""She has the most perfect figure,"" coos Valentino.)\n\nHer influence in the fashion world is so great that she is shortly to be unveiled as the international face of Chanel No 5 perfume.\n\nIn media terms, she has blossomed since splitting from Cruise; it is fair to say that she has never been in such demand.\n\nBut the question many are asking is why Nicole, who has relocated to New York with her two adopted children, Conor and Isabella, is looking so tired and nervy?\n\nAnd why, they are wondering in Italy, has she pulled out of the Venice film festival?\n\nAnd why, they wonder in Hollywood, has she turned down a \xc2\xa310million payday - the biggest of her career - to star in a film opposite Brad Pitt?\n\nThere are signs that Nicole - who said in the spring that she feared a ""burnout"" - is under a considerable amount of pressure, both emotional and professional.\n\nShe is still alone, despite a fling with rap star Q-Tip and a flirtation with rock star Lenny Kravitz, from whom she is renting a penthouse while her own pad in the city is renovated.\n\nHer romantic friendship with Russell Crowe has foundered, and he has now married his on-off girlfriend Danielle, who is expecting a baby.\n\nHow painful this must be for Nicole, who longs to have a baby herself.\n\nOverwhelmed with grief after miscarriage\n\nShe was, by her own admission, almost overwhelmed by grief when she had a miscarriage only six weeks after her marriage to Cruise ended.\n\nThose who know her best say that she is still puzzling over the wreckage of that marriage and trying to come to terms with the feelings of abandonment and rejection which resulted.\n\n""I don\'t think two people could have been happier than Tom and I,"" she mused.\n\nI was desperate to have a baby with Tom\n\n""He swept me off my feet and I fell madly, passionately in love. I was consumed by it. And I was desperate to have a baby with him. That\'s what I wish I\'d done.""\n\nHer vulnerable state of mind is not helped by a recurrence of the insomnia which has plagued her for much of her adult life.\n\nFurthermore, she has been driven to the brink by film roles about rejected, depressed and oppressed women - with whom she identifies to a remarkable extent.\n\nIn an interview she said that she hesitated to play the suicidal Virginia Woolf in The Hours, because she feared the effect on her own state of mind.\n\n""I wasn\'t sure I could go through with it. Virginia Woolf\'s unhappiness was just too similar to my own.\n\nHesitated to play suicidal Virginia Woolf\n\n""I was afraid to do it because I thought it would be too painful,"" she said.\n\n""But I think characters come into your life sometimes because they\'re meant to ... I was able to use her and her knowledge.""\n\nThere are signs that she is no less troubled currently on the set of Stepford Wives in New York.\n\nThe crew are said to be muttering about delays because she does not want to film outside in strong sunshine.\n\nHer representatives say this is utter nonsense. ""No one is more professional than Nicole,"" they aver, sternly.\n\nBut whatever the truth of those reports, one does wonder whether the film - a remake of the Seventies classic, about a town where wives are replaced by compliant domestic robots - has uncomfortable resonances for Nicole, whose Catholic beliefs were put aside by her Scientologist husband, and who, during her marriage, lost her identity in his.\n\nWhat she yearns for is love - the love she gave to Cruise and which she still feels for him.\n\nShe yearns for love\n\n""I\'ve said to Tom, I will be there for him for the rest of his life, always,"" she said earlier this year.\n\n""Tom and I had 11 years together. Your heart has to stay loving.""\n\nShe surprised everyone by admitting at the Cannes Film Festival that she would give up her career for love.\n\n""I won\'t do this for the rest of my life, there\'s other things that interest me,\' she said.\n\n""I think when I fall in love, I\'ll stop doing as much of this because I want to settle down again.""\n\nWhat she has experienced since then, though, are little more than dangerous flirtations.\n\nQ-Tip, her escort at the premiere of The Hours, appeared to have been chosen because he is as unlike her former husband as it is possible to be.\n\nKravitz, meanwhile, took her to Puff Daddy\'s birthday party - again an event which would be anathema to strait-laced Cruise. In private, Nicole talks a great deal about concentrating on her children and trying to ""make it up to them"" - she feels immensely guilty about the divorce.\n\nShe also complains that she would like to find a man with whom she could have an intelligent conversation.\n\nShe is unhappily single\n\nThe Jude Law episode - when she was falsely accused of breaking up his marriage - was bruising and she felt humiliated that anyone would think she would steal another woman\'s husband.\n\nTheir meetings on both sides of the Atlantic were professional. In short, she remains steadfastly but unhappily single.\n\nWhat a pity, for this is surely the golden period in Nicole\'s professional life. She took the Best Actress Oscar this spring for The Hours.\n\nLater this year Cold Mountain, the Civil War epic directed by Anthony Minghella, will be released, and there is already an Oscar buzz forming about this bleak film.\n\nAlso later this year she will be seen in The Human Stain, opposite Sir Anthony Hopkins.\n\nThen there is Birth, a film about a grieving widow, which she made early this year, and after that Stepford Wives, scheduled for release next year.\n\nBecause of delays in filming Stepford Wives, she has had to pull out of the Venice Film Festival, and because of the promotional schedule of Cold Mountain she has had to pull out of Mr and Mrs Smith, opposite Pitt.\n\nHer diary is indeed creaking at the seams. And she is determined to make the most of her status while she can, despite the insecurity which leads her sometimes to fear taking on projects in case she is not good enough.\n\n""There was a time when part of me didn\'t really want to take on too many projects because I had other priorities like my marriage and my family,"" she said earlier this year.\n\n""Now I feel more confident. Also I find with two children that are older, that allows me a bit more time to devote to making films.\n\n""They don\'t need you every five minutes and they spend time with their father.\n\n""In any case I\'m a pragmatist, and I won\'t always be offered these opportunities.

"b'This article is about the American actress. For others with similar names, see Kate Holmes (disambiguation)\n\nAmerican actress\n\nKate Noelle Holmes (born December 18, 1978) is an American actress. She first achieved fame as Joey Potter on the television series Dawson\'s Creek (1998\xe2\x80\x932003).[3]\n\nShe made her feature film debut in Ang Lee\'s The Ice Storm in 1997.[9] Subsequent film roles include: Go, Teaching Mrs. Tingle (both 1999), Wonder Boys, The Gift (both 2000), Abandon, Phone Booth (both 2002), The Singing Detective, Pieces of April (both 2003), Batman Begins, Thank You for Smoking (both 2005), Mad Money (2008), Don\'t Be Afraid of the Dark (2010), Jack and Jill (2011), Miss Meadows (2014), Woman in Gold, Touched with Fire (both 2015), Logan Lucky (2017) and the independent film Coda (2019).\n\nIn 2008, she made her Broadway theatre debut in a production of Arthur Miller\'s All My Sons. In 2011, she played Jacqueline Kennedy in the TV miniseries The Kennedys, a role she reprised in The Kennedys: After Camelot (2017). She made her directorial debut with the 2016 film All We Had, in which she also starred.\n\nEarly life [ edit ]\n\nHolmes was born in Toledo, Ohio.[10] She is the youngest of five children born to Kathleen A. Stothers, a homemaker and philanthropist, and Martin Joseph Holmes Sr., an attorney who played basketball at Marquette University under coach Al McGuire.[11][12][13][14] She has three sisters and one brother. Holmes was baptized a Roman Catholic and attended Christ the King Church in Toledo.[15]\n\nShe graduated from the all-female Notre Dame Academy in Toledo (also her mother\'s alma mater), where she was a 4.0 student.[16][17] At St. John\'s Jesuit and St. Francis de Sales, nearby all-male high schools, Holmes appeared in school musicals, playing a waitress in Hello, Dolly! and Lola in Damn Yankees.[18] She scored 1310 out of 1600 on her SAT and was accepted to Columbia University (and attended for a summer session);[10][16] her father wanted her to become a doctor.[17]\n\nAt age 14, she began classes at a modeling school in Toledo which led her to the International Modeling and Talent Association (IMTA) Competition held in New York City in 1996. Eventually, Holmes was signed to an agent after performing a monologue from To Kill a Mockingbird.[8] An audition tape was sent to the casting director for the 1997 film The Ice Storm, directed by Ang Lee, and Holmes made her big-screen debut in the role of Libbets Casey in the film, opposite Kevin Kline and Sigourney Weaver.[18]\n\nCareer [ edit ]\n\n1997\xe2\x80\x932003: Dawson\'s Creek and career development [ edit ]\n\nHolmes in May 2006\n\nIn January 1997, Holmes went to Los Angeles for pilot season, when producers cast and shoot new programs in the hopes of securing a spot on a network schedule. The Toledo Blade reported she was offered the lead in Buffy the Vampire Slayer but she turned it down in order to finish high school.[18] Columbia TriStar Television, producer of a new show named Dawson\'s Creek that was created by screenwriter Kevin Williamson, asked her to come to Los Angeles to audition, but there was a conflict with her schedule. ""I was doing my school play, Damn Yankees. And I was playing Lola. I even got to wear the feather boa. I thought, \'There is no way I\'m not playing Lola to go audition for some network. I couldn\'t let my school down. We had already sold a lot of tickets. So I told Kevin and The WB, \'I\'m sorry. I just can\'t meet with you this week. I\'ve got other commitments.\'""[7][18][19]\n\nThe producers permitted her to audition on videotape. Holmes read for the part of Joey Potter, the tomboy best friend of the title character Dawson, on a videotape shot in her basement, her mother reading Dawson\'s lines.[7][20]\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter claimed the story of Holmes\'s audition ""has become the stuff of legend"" and ""no one even thought that it was weird that one of the female leads would audition via Federal Express.""[21] Holmes won the part. Paul Stupin, executive producer of the show, said his first reaction on seeing her audition tape was ""That\'s Joey Potter!""[22] Creator and executive producer Kevin Williamson said Holmes has a ""unique combination of talent, beauty and skill that makes Hollywood come calling. But that\'s just the beginning. To meet her is to instantly fall under her spell.""[23] Williamson thought she had exactly the right look for Joey Potter. ""She had those eyes, those eyes just stained with loneliness.""[24] While Dawson\'s Creek was met with mixed reviews,[25] Holmes attained national attention.[26][27] Holmes was soon on the covers of magazines such as Seventeen, TV Guide, and Rolling Stone. Jancee Dunn, an editor at Rolling Stone said she was chosen for the cover because ""every time you mention Dawson\'s Creek you tend to get a lot of dolphin-like shrieks from teenage girls. The fact that she is drop-dead gorgeous didn\'t hurt either.""[28]\n\nDuring her time as a series regular on Dawson\'s Creek, Holmes first leading role in a film came in 1998\'s Disturbing Behavior, a Scream-era Stepford Wives-goes-to-high school thriller, where she was a loner from the wrong side of the tracks. The film was recut from what the director intended. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times wrote of her character, Rachel, ""dresses in black and likes to strike poses on the beds of pickup trucks and is a bad girl who is in great danger of becoming a very good one.""[29][30] Despite the fact that it received mixed reviews and was not a huge financial success, the actress won a MTV Movie Award for Best Breakthrough Performance for the role and also received a Saturn Award nomination for the part. Holmes, though, said the film was ""just horrible.""[17] In 1999, she played a disaffected supermarket clerk in Doug Liman\'s ensemble piece Go.[31] The film received excellent reviews and made a profit, and Holmes herself was liked by critics. The same year, in Kevin Williamson\'s Teaching Mrs. Tingle, which he wrote and directed, Holmes played a straight-A student whose vindictive teacher (Helen Mirren) threatens to keep her from a desperately needed scholarship.[32] Also in 1999, she had an uncredited cameo with Dawson\'s Creek co-star Joshua Jackson in Muppets from Space, which was filmed in Wilmington where Dawson\'s Creek also filmed.[33]\n\nThe year 2000 saw Holmes feature in two film roles. The first was in Wonder Boys, directed by Curtis Hanson from the novel by Michael Chabon. The film told the story of a creative writing teacher at a university, with Michael Douglas in the leading role. Holmes had a small role (six and one-half minutes of screen time) as Hannah Green, the talented student who lusts after Professor Grady Tripp (Douglas\'s character, who is her instructor and landlord). Many leading critics at the time took favorable notice to Holmes in the film. Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times said she was ""just right as the beauty with kind of a crush on the old man.""[24][34][35] Her second feature film during 2000 was The Gift, a Southern Gothic story directed by Sam Raimi and starring Cate Blanchett, she played the antithesis of Joey Potter: a promiscuous rich girl having affairs with everyone from a sociopathic wife-beater (Keanu Reeves) to the district attorney (Gary Cole), and is murdered by her fianc\xc3\xa9 (Greg Kinnear). Holmes did her first nude scene for the film, in a scene where her character was about to be murdered. Her appearance was lamented by Variety\'s Steven Kotler.[36] In Ohio, the scene met with disapproval from Russ Lemmon writing in the Toledo Blade.[37]\n\nHolmes hosted Saturday Night Live on February 24, 2001, participating in a send-up of Dawson\'s Creek where she falls madly in love with Chris Kattan\'s Mr. Peepers character and singing ""Big Spender"" from Sweet Charity. In the 2002 film Abandon, written by Oscar winner Stephen Gaghan, Holmes plays a delusional, homicidal college student named ""Katie"". Todd McCarthy of Variety and Roger Ebert commended her performance,[38] but other critics savaged it.[39] During the final season of Dawson\'s Creek, Holmes played the mistress of the public relations flack played by Colin Farrell in Phone Booth, which was both critically and financially successful. She also appeared as Robert Downey, Jr.\'s nurse in The Singing Detective (2003). Dawson\'s Creek ended its run in 2003, and Holmes was the only actor to appear in all 128 episodes. ""It was very difficult for me to leave Wilmington, to have my little glass bubble burst and move on. I hate change. On the other hand it was refreshing to play someone else"", she said in 2004.[40]\n\n2003\xe2\x80\x932009: Focus on film career, brief hiatus, and theatre work [ edit ]\n\nHolmes\' first starring role post-Dawson\'s Creek was in 2003\'s Pieces of April, a gritty comedy about a dysfunctional family on Thanksgiving. Many critics and audiences agreed that Holmes had given her best performance in the film as April. Variety said it was ""one of her best film performances.""[41] ""Each actor shines"", wrote Elvis Mitchell, ""even Ms. Holmes, whose beauty seems to have fogged the minds of her previous directors"" in playing ""a brat who is slaving to find her inner decency and barely has the equipment for such an achievement, let alone to serve a meal whose salmonella potential could claim an entire borough. Yet it is her surliness, as well as her intransigent determination to make Thanksgiving work, that keeps the laughs coming.""[42] Holmes also received a Satellite Award for Best Actress for the role. On the November 9, 2003 episode, she was Punk\'d by Ashton Kutcher and the next year she was the subject of an episode of the MTV program Diary.[43]\n\nHolmes was a contender for the role of Christine Daa\xc3\xa9 in 2004\'s The Phantom of the Opera,[44] but lost the role to Emmy Rossum. That year, she starred as the U.S. President\'s daughter in First Daughter, which was originally slated to be released in January 2004 on the same day as Chasing Liberty, another film about a president\'s daughter, but was ultimately released in September 2004, to negative reviews and low ticket sales. First Daughter, directed by Forest Whitaker, also starred Michael Keaton as her character\'s father and Marc Blucas as her love interest. The Hollywood Reporter\'s critic called her character Samantha Mackenzie ""a startling example of how a studio film can dumb down and neutralize the comic abilities of a lively young star.""[45] In the 2005 film Batman Begins she played Rachel Dawes, an attorney in the Gotham City district attorney\'s office and the childhood sweetheart of the title character. Variety was unenthusiastic. ""Holmes is OK"", was its critic\'s sole remark on her performance.[46] She was nominated for a Golden Raspberry for ""worst supporting actress"" for the film.[47]\n\nIn 2005, Holmes characterised her film career as being a string of ""bombs."" ""Usually I\'m not even in the top ten"", she said, the highest-grossing film of her career then being Phone Booth.[5] She lamented ""It\'s not like I have a lot of stuff that\'s great just waiting for me to sign on to.""[48] She also appeared in the film version of Christopher Buckley\'s satirical novel Thank You for Smoking about a tobacco lobbyist played by Aaron Eckhart, whom Holmes\'s character, a Washington reporter, seduces. Variety wrote one of the film\'s ""sole relatively weak notes [came] from Holmes, who lacks even a hint of the wiliness of a ruthless reporter"" and The New York Times said the cast was ""exceptionally fine"" except for Holmes, who ""strain[ed] credulity"" in her role.[49][50] The film ended up a success, even earning a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy. Also in 2005, Holmes had agreed to play in Shame on You, a biopic about the country singer Spade Cooley written and directed by Dennis Quaid, as the wife whom Cooley (played by Quaid) stomps to death. But the picture, set to shoot in New Orleans, Louisiana, was delayed by Hurricane Katrina, and Holmes dropped out due to her pregnancy.[51][52][53] After her daughter, Suri Cruise, was born in April 2006, Holmes took a hiatus from her acting career until 2008.[citation needed]\n\nAfter speculation about Holmes reprising her role in The Dark Knight, the sequel to Batman Begins, it was finally confirmed that she would not appear. Her role was later recast with Maggie Gyllenhaal in her place.[54] Instead, Holmes decided to star in the comedy Mad Money, opposite Diane Keaton and Queen Latifah in 2008. The film flopped.[55] The Canadian Press criticized Holmes\'s performance, ""While Keaton has long done zany and giddy well, and she and Latifah have an interesting contrast of personalities, Holmes\' presence feels like an afterthought.""[56] The New York Post, The New York Times and Variety also criticized Holmes\' performance in the film, and The New York Times called Holmes ""the movie\'s weakest link"".[57][58]\n\nReturning to television in 2008, Holmes appeared in an episode of Eli Stone as Grace, a lawyer, and her singing and dancing was praised by Tim Stack of Entertainment Weekly.[59] Holmes made her Broadway debut in the revival of Arthur Miller\'s All My Sons[60] in October 2008. She opened to mixed reviews. Ben Brantley of The New York Times claimed ""the neophyte Ms. Holmes"" is a ""sad casualty"" of director Simon McBurney\'s ""high concept approach"" to the play. He adds that ""Ms. Holmes delivers most of her lines with meaningful asperity, italicizing every word.""[61] Clive Barnes of the New York Post was similarly unimpressed by Holmes \xe2\x80\x93 and had few compliments for her co-stars. He wrote, ""John Lithgow starts in a sunny, benign fashion, but eventually finds himself screeching alongside Holmes, looking tough under a glossy wig.""[62] However, the New York Daily News\' Joe Dziemianowicz took a more positive view of her stage debut, writing, ""Holmes, a TV and film vet, makes a fine Broadway debut. Her rather grand speech pattern takes getting used to, but she seems comfortable and adds a fitting glint of glamour.""[63] In 2009, Holmes appeared in the National Memorial Day Concert on the Mall in Washington, D.C. in a dialogue with Dianne Wiest celebrating the life of an American veteran seriously wounded in Iraq, Jos\xc3\xa9 Peque\xc3\xb1o.[64]\n\n2010\xe2\x80\x93present: Television work and return to film [ edit ]\n\nIn 2009, Holmes began filming a remake of the 1970s ABC telemovie Don\'t Be Afraid of the Dark; the film was released in August 2011.[65] Also in 2011, Holmes played the role of Jackie Kennedy in the TV miniseries The Kennedys. In October 2011, she also portrayed ""Slutty Pumpkin"" (Naomi), in the TV show How I Met Your Mother, episode ""The Slutty Pumpkin Returns"".[citation needed]\n\nIn 2012, Holmes appeared in Theresa Rebeck\'s new comedy Dead Accounts on Broadway.[66] Holmes and Chace Crawford were reportedly cast as the leads in the romantic comedy Responsible Adults, to begin shooting in Los Angeles in ""Fall 2011"".[67][68][69] In 2015, Holmes joined the third season of Ray Donovan.[70]\n\nHolmes directed a short 2015 documentary for ESPN about Olympic gymnast Nadia Com\xc4\x83neci entitled, Eternal Princess, that premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival.[71][72]\n\nShe directed her first movie All We Had.[73] The film stars Katie Holmes, Stefania LaVie Owen, Luke Wilson, Richard Kind, Mark Consuelos, Judy Greer and Eve Lindley. The film was released on December 9, 2016, by Gravitas Ventures.[74]\n\nIn 2017, Holmes starred in the heist comedy Logan Lucky, directed by Steven Soderbergh. The film received positive reviews, with many critics praising the cast\'s performances and Soderbergh\'s direction, and grossed $48 million worldwide.[75]\n\nIn 2018, she appeared in the satirical comedy Dear Dictator, opposite Michael Caine.[76] The same year, she made a cameo in the movie Ocean\'s 8, starring Sandra Bullock, Cate Blanchett, Anne Hathaway, Mindy Kaling, Sarah Paulson, Rihanna, Helena Bonham Carter, and Awkwafina. The film follows a group of women led by Debbie Ocean, the sister of Danny Ocean, who plan a sophisticated heist of the annual Met Gala at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, United States. Ocean\'s 8 premiered at Alice Tully Hall on June 5, 2018, and was released by Warner Bros. Pictures in the United States on June 8, 2018, 11 years to the day of the release of Ocean\'s Thirteen. The film has grossed over $297 million worldwide and received a lukewarm response from critics, who applauded the chemistry of the cast but found the movie undemanding and less consistent than the films in Soderbergh\'s trilogy.\n\nIn 2019, she played in the independent film Coda alongside Patrick Stewart.[77] The movie is acclamed by cricts and received 3 out of 4 stars.[77][78][79]\n\nIn 2020, she was starred in the movie Brahms: The Boy II.[80] The film was theatrically released in the United States on February 21, 2020.[81][82] and grossed $20 million worldwide against a production budget of $10 million.[83] The same year, she was the main character in the movie The Secret: Dare to Dream co-starring Josh Lucas, Jerry O\'Connell and Celia Weston, which was released in the United States through video on demand, and theatrically in several countries, on July 31, 2020, by Roadside Attractions and Gravitas Ventures, following the COVID-19 pandemic.[84][85] In its debut weekend, The Secret: Dare to Dream was the top-rented film on FandangoNow, second at Apple TV, seventh on the iTunes Store, and 10th on Spectrum.[86][87] In its second weekend the film finished second on FandangoNow\'s weekly rental chart, and placed on two others.[88][89]\n\nPublic image [ edit ]\n\nHolmes was annually named by both the British and American editions of FHM magazine as one of the sexiest women in the world from 1999 onward. She was named one of People\'s ""50 Most Beautiful People"" in 2003; its sibling Teen People declared her one of the ""25 Hottest Stars Under 25"" that year;[90][91] and in 2005, People said she was one of the ten best dressed stars that year.[92] She has appeared in advertisements for Garnier Lumia haircolor, Coach leather goods, and clothing retailer Gap.[93]\n\nIn November 2008, it was confirmed that she would be the new face of the spring 2009 campaign for the high-end fashion line Miu Miu.[94] In 2008, Holmes started a high fashion clothing line called Holmes & Yang with longtime stylist Jeanne Yang.[95] Model Heidi Klum is a fan of the line.[96] In July 2009, Holmes, Nigel Lythgoe, Adam Shankman, and Carrie Ann Inaba announced the launch of a dance scholarship fund called the Dizzy Feet Foundation.[97]\n\nBeginning January 2011, she became the new face of Ann Taylor Spring 11 collection.[98] Holmes & Yang presented their fashion line at New York Fashion Week for the first time in September 2012.[99][100] Holmes acted as the face for the Bobbi Brown Cosmetics brand in spring 2013 and Holmes had her own capsule collection of color cosmetics in fall of that year.[101] In 2013, she appeared in an advertising campaign for IRIS Jewelry.[102] In January 2013, Holmes was announced as the brand ambassador and co-owner of Alterna Haircare.[103]\n\nPersonal life [ edit ]\n\nHolmes dated her Dawson\'s Creek co-star Joshua Jackson early in the show\'s run.[104] She claims Jackson was her first love.[105]\n\nShe met actor Chris Klein in 2000. They were engaged in late 2003, but in early 2005 ended their relationship. [106][107][108][109] They have remained friends to varying degrees since the breakup.[110]\n\nHolmes began dating actor Tom Cruise in April 2005. Holmes, who was raised a Catholic,[111][112] began studying Scientology shortly after the couple began dating.[113] They got engaged in June 2005, only seven weeks after meeting.[114] The couple\'s daughter, Suri, was born on April 18, 2006, the first anniversary of their first date. The name ""Suri"", as reported by Cruise\'s press release, derives from the Persian word for ""red rose"" and the Hebrew word for ""princess"".[115] On November 18, 2006, Holmes and Cruise were married in a Scientologist ceremony at the 15th-century Odescalchi Castle in Bracciano, Italy.[116] The actors\' publicist said the couple had ""officialized"" their marriage in Los Angeles the day before the Italian ceremony.[117]\n\nIn early March 2011, Holmes filed a $50-million libel lawsuit against Star magazine following a cover story which insinuated that she took drugs.[118] The suit was settled on April 27, 2011, after which Star wrote a public apology in the May 6, 2011 issue of their magazine, and made an ""undisclosed substantial donation"" to Holmes\' charity, Dizzy Feet Foundation.[119]\n\nHolmes and Cruise were last photographed together in Iceland on June 16, 2012. On June 29, Holmes filed for divorce from Cruise in New York after five-and-a-half years of marriage.[120][121] Following the announcement, those close to Holmes stated that she believed she had reason to fear that Cruise would abduct Suri, and also feared intimidation by the Church of Scientology.[122][123]\n\nTen days after Holmes filed for divorce, on July 9, 2012, attorneys for the couple announced that the couple had signed a divorce settlement.[124] This was the first divorce for Holmes and the third for Cruise.[125][126] Holmes has custody of Suri.[127]\n\nFollowing her divorce from Cruise, Holmes returned to the Roman Catholic Church and began attending St. Francis Xavier Church.[128]\n\nHolmes dated actor and musician Jamie Foxx from 2013 to 2019.[129]\n\nAwards [ edit ]\n\nIn June 2011, Holmes received the Women in Film Max Mara Face of the Future Award.[130] In 2005, TV Guide ranked Holmes No. 38 on its ""50 Sexiest Stars of All Time"" list.[131]\n\nFilmography [ edit ]\n\nFilm [ edit ]\n\nTelevision [ edit ]\n\nVideo games [ edit ]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 2005 Batman Begins Rachel Dawes Voice\n\nNotes [ edit ]\n\nReferences [ edit ]\n\nBibliography [ edit ]\n\nScott Lyle Cohen.

"b'At what point will Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani focus on their own lives and leave the exes alone?\n\nThis is a question being asked by several fans after a report surfaced claiming that The Voice coaches have their fingers crossed their former spouses \xe2\x80\x93 Miranda Lambert and Gavin Rossdale \xe2\x80\x93 will have children.\n\nShelton and the No Doubt diva have been dating since late 2015, and according to several reports that surfaced online, they are trying to conceive a baby the natural way.\n\nApparently, Stefani is very religious and does not believe in using contraceptives.\n\n#hidebehindmylashes ? @Revlon #megamultiplier mascara! #nosmudge. Lasts all day. #ad A post shared by Gwen Stefani (@gwenstefani) on Aug 18, 2017 at 12:52pm PDT\n\nA source close to the pair claimed that they realize that having a baby would be a blessing and they wish the same for their former flames.\n\nThe family friend shared: \xe2\x80\x9cGwen and Blake want everyone to be happy, and if Gavin or Miranda ever have children with their future relationships, they would be happy for them. Granted they are not focusing much attention on their exes\xe2\x80\x99 sex and family lives, but they would be OK if that were to happen and they would only hope they would accept things if Blake and Gwen become a family themselves. They are interested in moving forward on good terms and don\xe2\x80\x99t want to have any drama with their exes, so they are thinking positively about them when they are ever brought up. It is pointless to stress about things you cannot control. They are going just to be happy, and things will work out how they are supposed to work out.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe same so-called pal denied that Stefani is pregnant with Shelton\xe2\x80\x99s baby and added: \xe2\x80\x9cGwen is most definitely not pregnant. Blake has been low-key hoping for a while that they might have a happy accident and Gwen would wind up pregnant again but for now, that simply is not the case. Gwen is so tiny, if she has a big lunch, she can appear to be three months along.

"b""Jennifer Garner's Trainer Launched a Wellness App That Uses Artificial Intelligence\n\nCeleb-beloved Body By Simone founder Simone De La Rue and nutritionist-to-the-stars Kelly LeVeque collaborated on BBS, using artificial intelligence to customize fitness and nutrition programs for users.\n\nLeave it to two A-list wellness gurus to democratize customized fitness and nutrition programs for the world. The dream team of Body By Simone personal trainer Simone De La Rue and nutritionist Kelly LeVeque \xe2\x80\x94 whose client list includes the likes of Jennifer Garner, Emmy Rossum, Jessica Alba and Molly Sims \xe2\x80\x94 have just released an app that gives users access to their expertise for a very nominal monthly fee.\n\nBut it\xe2\x80\x99s not just an app stuffed with content \xe2\x80\x94 more than 900 minutes of video and hundreds of recipes \xe2\x80\x94 that leaves users to their own devices to navigate and motivate. For $19.99/month, the platform actually uses artificial intelligence software to create customized workout plans and nutrition programs for each individual, taking into consideration their specific goals. It tracks progress via measurements and weekly photos, and reminds users via push notifications to work out. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is programmed to provide the customization of a personal workout with me,\xe2\x80\x9d says De La Rue, adding, \xe2\x80\x9cThis has never been done before in a fitness app.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut while it may seem the app approach speaks only to the general population, De La Rue says hers and LeVeque\xe2\x80\x99s celebrity clients are \xe2\x80\x9cvery excited, especially as they are often on set or traveling. They can have their dream team in their pocket.\xe2\x80\x9d The impetus for the app was a desire to have a platform available to anyone in the world, since the Aussie trainer on E\xe2\x80\x99s Revenge Body can\xe2\x80\x99t be everywhere at once. For a more 360-degree approach, she wanted to include a nutritionist, and because of their several shared clients (Garner and Rossum among them) and complementary beliefs and philosophies, LeVeque was the ideal fit.\n\nWhen it comes to nutrition, protein and plants are at the core. Recipes run the gamut and might include Jen Garner\xe2\x80\x99s Chocolate Blueberry #fab4smoothie, with collagen, almond butter, spinach, flax and other nutritious ingredients. Says LeVeque of their approach: \xe2\x80\x9cProtein ups collagen, muscle tone and metabolism. Fat benefits hormones, skin and cellular health and does not store as fat as simple carbs do. Fiber for gut microbiome proliferation and detoxification, and greens or veggies deep in color to fight inflammation.\xe2\x80\x9d These \xe2\x80\x9cfab four\xe2\x80\x9d foods are at the core of her recipes.\n\nThe workouts mix up methodology to keep things interesting, and never use props so they can be done literally anywhere. De La Rue\xe2\x80\x99s favorite currently: dance cardio. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s an incredible workout, burns calories, teaches you coordination, challenges your brain to learn choreography and it\xe2\x80\x99s fun and joyous,\xe2\x80\x9d she says. The pair\xe2\x80\x99s one-stop-shop app also doles out motivational words and advice, since that\xe2\x80\x99s key to many people\xe2\x80\x99s success with a new wellness plan.\n\nLeVeque suggests users get up and exercise first thing in the morning, since a fasted workout has the same benefits as intermittent fasting, which causes a surge in human growth hormone and testosterone to help burn fat. Additionally, she advocates for early dinners, before dark \xe2\x80\x94 which seems decidedly un-Hollywood but has very Hollywood ramifications. \xe2\x80\x9cAn early dinner allows for the body to digest the meal, balance blood sugar and clear excess insulin before you head to bed,\xe2\x80\x9d says LeVeque, \xe2\x80\x9cso you can benefit from a fat-burning, belt-shrinking night of sleep!\xe2\x80\x9d We see why Garner and Rossum swear by these ladies."""

"b'Does Brad Pitt Have a Rare Disease?\n\nRDR Staff\n\nAbout prosopagnosia\n\nAbout epidermolysis bullosa\n\nIn this week\xe2\x80\x99s Hollywood gossip, it was revealed that Brad Pitt does not have a rare disease that is \xe2\x80\x98eating him away.\xe2\x80\x99Whew.However, the actor is no stranger to the rare disease community. Pitt is an honorary member of the Epidermolysis Bullosa Medical Research Foundation (EBMRF) that is dedicated to raising money and awareness for the rare skin disorder, epidermolysis bullosa.In January, Pitt introduced singer Chris Cornell during a Rock4EB annual charity to support EBMRF.Further, he revealed in a 2013 Esquire Magazine interview that he self-diagnosed himself with a rare disease \xe2\x80\x93 prosopagnosia \xe2\x80\x94 also known as face blindness. According to the article, ""Brad Pitt won\'t remember you. If you\'ve met him, he\'ll have no idea who you are when he meets you again. Even if you\'ve had what he calls ""a real conversation,"" your face will start fading from his memory as soon as you walk away.""It should be noted that being diagnosed with a condition and being self-diagnosed with a condition can be 2 very different diagnoses.Prosopagnosia refers to the inability to recognize familiar people from their face. They may also be unable to recognize other stimuli, such as objects, cars, or animals.People with prosopagnosia typically learn to use non-face cues including voice, walking style and hairstyle to recognize others. The underlying genetic cause of developmental prosopagnosia is not known but familial reports of this condition are consistent with autosomal dominant inheritance.Epidermolysis bullosa (aka \'the worst disease you\'ve never heard of\') is a group of devastating, life-threatening genetic skin disorders impacting children that is characterized by skin blisters and erosions all over the body.The most severe form, recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa, is characterized by chronic skin blistering, open and painful wounds, joint contractures, esophageal strictures, pseudosyndactyly, corneal abrasions and a shortened life span. Patients with recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa lack functional type VII collagen (C7) owing to mutations in the gene COL7A1 that encodes for C7 and is the main component of anchoring fibrils that attach the dermis to the epidermis.Epidermolysis bullosa patients suffer through intense pain throughout their lives, with no effective treatments available to reduce the severity of their symptoms.'"

They announced they were ending their 13-year marriage in August 2015, one month after Shelton and Lambert announced they were divorcing after four years.\n\nThe \xe2\x80\x9cCame Here to Forget\xe2\x80\x9d singer and Stefani leaned on each other for support during the difficult time. The closer they got, the more Shelton saw Stefani in a new light.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s kind of how our friendship and bond started, that day. It went from that, to checking in on each other once a week through email \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x98This s\xe2\x80\x93t happened to me, what happened to you?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x94 to maybe three times a week, then every day, to \xe2\x80\x98Hey, here\xe2\x80\x99s my phone number if you ever want to text,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Shelton told Billboard. \xe2\x80\x9cNext thing I know, I wake up and she\xe2\x80\x99s all I care about, and I\xe2\x80\x99m \xc2\xadwondering if she feels the same about me.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGwen saved my life,\xe2\x80\x9d he added. \xe2\x80\x9cWho else on earth could understand going through a high-profile divorce from another musician? You can\xe2\x80\x99t even imagine the similarities in our divorces.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe two teamed up professionally too. Shelton included their collaborative track, \xe2\x80\x9cGo Ahead and Break My Heart,\xe2\x80\x9d on his 12th studio album, If I\xe2\x80\x99m Honest.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen we recorded the vocals for some of these songs, I was only six months removed from when all the crap went down,\xe2\x80\x9d Shelton said of his split from Lambert. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen you have a broken heart \xe2\x80\x94 at least, when I do \xe2\x80\x94 you got to get it out of your system. You want people to sympathize with you. I was at rock bottom, in the middle of hell.\xe2\x80\x9d'"

"b'Never say never! Gwen Stefani may have thought her pregnancy days were behind her, but she\xe2\x80\x99s considering having one more baby to make Blake Shelton a dad. HollywoodLife.com has the EXCLUSIVE details on how she\xe2\x80\x99s been inspired by late-in-life mom Janet Jackson.\n\nAge is nothing but a number when it comes to having a baby these days. Janet Jackson just proved miracles can happen by giving birth to a healthy son despite being 50-years-old. That has 47-year-old Gwen Stefani inspired to make her boyfriend Blake Shelton, 40, a first time dad. \xe2\x80\x9cGwen would love to have another child with Blake. He\xe2\x80\x99s not pressuring her at all, but she knows it\xe2\x80\x99s something he would love too,\xe2\x80\x9d a source tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe isn\xe2\x80\x99t focused on it obsessively, but seeing Janet Jackson have a healthy baby at 50 has inspired her to open her mind more to the possibility. It\xe2\x80\x99s made her start to see it as something she and Blake really could make happen,\xe2\x80\x9d our insider adds. Gwen is already mom to three boys, Kingston, 10, eight-year-old Zuma and her littlest one Apollo, three. She\xe2\x80\x99s made it known big time over the years how it would be a dream come true to have a little girl, so this could be the perfect chance!\n\nThe singer reminded us all why she really wants a daughter on The Voice Apr. 18 when commenting on her only female team member Brennley Brown. After the adorable teenage country singer performed \xe2\x80\x9cFly\xe2\x80\x9d by Maddie & Tae, Gwen declared, \xe2\x80\x9cAll I wanted was a little girl I could hang out with and play dress up with and \xe2\x80\x94 she\xe2\x80\x99s my only girl and look at her!\xe2\x80\x9d Awww. It\xe2\x80\x99s just so wrong that she never had a little mini-me that she could do all sorts of fun girly-girl activities with. We can only imagine how doting a daddy Blake would be to an adorable daughter with Gwen!\n\nHollywoodLifers, do you think Gwen and Blake would have a beautiful child? Who do you think would it resemble more?'"

"b'The rumour: Meghan Markle is caught in a feud between Amal Clooney and Angelina Jolie\n\nRoyal Wedding Fashion: The Good, The Bad And The Bloody Awful!Where you heard it: New Idea magazine\n\nThe report: Amal\xe2\x80\x99s presence at the Greatest Event of Our Lifetime last month was pretty flashy (you don\xe2\x80\x99t wear head-to-toe canary to fade into the wallpaper, after all), and according to this Australian tabloid, Angelina Jolie could barely contain her \xe2\x80\x9cfierce\xe2\x80\x9d jealousy watching her rival bask in the royal spotlight. This is \xe2\x80\x94 according to New Idea\xe2\x80\x99s unnamed source \xe2\x80\x94 part of a larger \xe2\x80\x9cbattle brewing between Angelina Jolie and Amal Clooney, with both stars desperate to befriend [Markle].\xe2\x80\x9d Which is pretty awesome considering that less than two years ago, MM was about a thousand ranks below either woman on the celebrity power ladder (and they say the British class system doesn\xe2\x80\x99t allow for upward mobility). But is it true?\n\nThe smell test: Eau de stinky kippers wafts intensely around this story, which doesn\xe2\x80\x99t even bother to explain why Jolie might have hoped to score a wedding invite. (If she has ever met Meghan Markle before, the Internet doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know about it.) Is it plausible that Angelina is interested in meeting with the newly powerful Duchess of Sussex to discuss their shared passions for human rights and social justice? Well sure, but that\xe2\x80\x99s hardly evidence of a feud. As for the alleged friction between Angie and Amal, that (probably false) narrative has been around for a while now, stemming from the fact that Brad Pitt got George in the divorce.\n\nThe rumour: Protestors will greet the Queen and Meghan Markle on their first royal overnight trip\n\nWhere you heard it: The Express\n\nThe report: First of all, can we just discuss the fact that Meghan and the Queen are going on their first ever sleepover so soon? People magazine has reported that Her Majesty wants to take a \xe2\x80\x9csteadying hand\xe2\x80\x9d with her new granddaughter-in-law to ensure the dignity of the monarchy remains intact, but isn\xe2\x80\x99t it also possible that they unlikely duo are new BFFs who can\xe2\x80\x99t get enough of hanging out and talking about their dogs? Anyway \xe2\x80\x94 back to the protest. According to The Express, a group that calls itself the Scrap Mersey Tolls has changed the date of a previously scheduled demonstration in Cheshire in order to coincide with the royal visit on June 14th. The reason for the protest is the plan to implement tolls on the new Mersey Gateway Bridge, which Her Majesty is there to open. (Awkwaaaaaaard).\n\nThe smell test: A post on the Scrap Mersey Tolls Facebook page proves that this story is legit, if a little overblown, given that so far only six people have confirmed they will be attending the protest (two others are \xe2\x80\x9cinterested\xe2\x80\x9d). At best a bit of a bloody nuisance, perhaps, but nothing that Thelma and Louise The Queen and The Duchess of Sussex can\xe2\x80\x99t handle.\n\nThe rumour: Meghan Markle has sparked a freckle tattoo trend\n\nSubscribe To Our Newsletters \xe2\x80\x94 And Get All Our Royal Coverage Straight To Your InboxWhere you heard it: Elle UK\n\nThe report: The \xe2\x80\x9cMeghan Markle Effect\xe2\x80\x9d has thus far been used to describe MM\xe2\x80\x99s considerable influence on all things fashion, style and messy bun. And now it appears the Duchess\xe2\x80\x99s signature sun spots are on the \xe2\x80\x9cthings to covet\xe2\x80\x9d list, so much so that semi-permanent freckle tattoos are a hot new beauty treatment.\n\nThe smell test: There is no question that freckled faces have a powerful ambassador in the newest royal, who has made a point of rejecting any attempts to airbrush her natural complexion. Semi-permanent tattooing may sound a bit extreme, but hey, so are a lot of the over-the-top beauty trends we hear about these days (semen facials, anyone?). The Elle story quotes an interview with an American tattoo artist (and \xe2\x80\x9ctattoo freckle pro\xe2\x80\x9d) who says she has been \xe2\x80\x9ccrazy busy\xe2\x80\x9d keeping up with demand following the royal wedding. Note that the whole process takes only an hour, and lasts up to three years, which is either a pro or a con depending on how quickly you wish you had just bought a brown eyeliner and created fake freckles DIY-style.\n\nThe rumour: Meghan and Harry want kids \xe2\x80\x9cright away\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWhere you heard it: Us Weekly\n\nThe report: First comes love, then comes royal wedding, then comes \xe2\x80\xa6 well, you know where this is going. Sighting \xe2\x80\x9cmultiple sources,\xe2\x80\x9d Us reports that Meghan\xe2\x80\x99s biological clock has been ticking loudly since the wedding. \xe2\x80\x9cShe and Harry want to start a family right away \xe2\x80\x94 and she\xe2\x80\x99ll start trying as soon as she can,\xe2\x80\x9d says one source, with the others making similar assertions. (One adds that MM\xe2\x80\x99s mom, Doria Ragland, expects to be a grandma by this time next year.)\n\nThe smell test: Isn\xe2\x80\x99t this kind of a non-story story? As we royal rumour watchers are well aware, both the Duke and Duchess have been vocal about their desire to start a family, so it\xe2\x80\x99s not like there was any big question mark. That, plus the fact that Meghan turns 37 in a couple of months, make the quick focus on family planning more of a foregone conclusion than a gossipy reveal. As for whether Doria will be a granny by next summer \xe2\x80\x94 that\xe2\x80\x99s really more of a matter for Mother Nature. (The only woman we can think of who may be more powerful than Her Majesty.)'"
"b""Postby Guest \xc2\xbb Sun Jun 14, 2009 3:22 pm\n\nSo things started going downhill after Jen was at the academy Awards show. And smiled at Pitt. Up till tpo that moment Crazy Jo-lie had kept Brad far from Jen. Make no mistake about it. Her frantic traveling all over the place was an attempt at keeping Pitt away from her and and any other person who might think they were a friend. She can't stand anyone but her having anything to do with Pitt . Including his own family. I knew it would backfire one day. Brad what took so long????? She suffers from an extreme mental illness. She doesn't have the kids in school for the same reason.\n\nI do believe she thought it would last. Seeing how sexy and pretty she thinks she is. A man should and would do anything she tells them to.\n\nI am under the impression her treatment of her surrogate Holly had a sort of wake up call to Pitt as to how utterly evil she is. You can bet she dismissed her like a piece of shite. A woman who carried twins for her.

"b'At home with The Hollywood Reporter, the \'Cake\' star gives a very candid interview about everything from being a ""control freak"" to loving \'The Bachelor,\' and even her relationships with Brad Pitt and Justin Theroux, as she enters a period of intense midlife contemplation (don\'t worry, it\'s not a crisis!): ""I know I have a bigger purpose.""\n\nThis story first appeared in the Jan. 30 issue of The Hollywood Reporter magazine.\n\nJust last week, all around Hollywood the words ""Jennifer Aniston"" and ""Oscar nomination"" were being mentioned in the same breath. The Friends star had made a stunning switch to serious drama with Cake, a roughly $7 million indie release that opens Jan. 23; the movie had debuted at the Toronto Film Festival to terrific reviews for the actress, if not for the film itself; she had Harvey Weinstein\'s former awards consultant, Lisa Taback, on the case; and a nomination looked teed up and ready to go.\n\nThen on Thursday, Jan. 15, at 5:40 a.m., the rug was pulled out from under the movie. Hours after Aniston\'s triumphant appearance at Cake\'s Los Angeles premiere, with a nomination from every other major voting body in Hollywood under her belt, a swirl of ""SNUBBED!"" headlines emerged when the best actress nominations were announced and they didn\'t include the star. After Selma (which landed just two noms, for picture and song), the Aniston rebuke was the dominant entertainment story du jour.\n\n""I know a lot of people were sorry,"" she says, speaking the day after the nominations. ""I feel I\'ve gotten such wonderful love \xe2\x80\x94 I had almost more phone calls and flowers than I did for any other nomination [in the past].""\n\nWhatever pain or anger she may have felt, whatever disappointment or sense of loss (and let\'s not kid ourselves: Every Oscar snub feels acute to even the strongest person), Aniston never let on. She even joked about it a few days later on Ellen, calling herself ""the number-one snubbed"" (an honor that might perhaps belong to Selma director Ava DuVernay). She was exactly what millions of fans who have known her for two decades wanted her to be: funny and self-deprecating and exquisitely human.\n\nOther actresses might have induced a tsunami of schadenfreude. But Aniston\'s enduring appeal is rooted in the very fact that she can be hurt, again and again \xe2\x80\x94 whether by the Oscars or the Sexiest Man Alive \xe2\x80\x94 and she\'ll endure. She\'s rich and glamorous and famous, but she\'s also one of us: a real person with a beating heart.\n\n***\n\nWe sit in Aniston\'s cavernous Bel Air living room, with the city spreading out through the floor-length windows. It is Jan. 8, a week before the nominations are to be announced, but right now other things are on her mind.\n\n""I\'ve cried deeply,"" she says. ""I\'ve felt immense loss in my life. Anybody who\'s felt pain or loss that has sent you to your knees knows [what that\'s like].""\n\nHer words catch me by surprise. We\'re halfway through a two-hour interview, and the frothy, fizzy woman I thought I knew so well from Friends has shed her professional shell, revealing a more complex and perhaps vulnerable person inside.\n\nShe\'s just slid off the long, gray sofa where she was sitting in her somewhat minimalist home and now is kneeling on the floor, one arm propped on a coffee table, in jeans and a T-shirt, looking remarkably young and well-toned. Her hair, the most scrutinized in modern media, is of course perfect; her rather artificial tan, less so \xe2\x80\x94 but then she\'s fresh from a photo shoot and hasn\'t had time to wipe it off.\n\nI hear a hint of regret, though she insists, ""I feel very happy. Life is quite extraordinary."" The words ""pain,"" ""anger"" and ""control"" pop up throughout our conversation \xe2\x80\x94 and not just in relation to Cake, a heavy drama in which she plays a woman dealing with debilitating pain following a deadly car crash.\n\nPhotos by Ruven Afanador\n\nCake marks a transition for the star, who\'s at a point in her life when transitions really matter. It would be wrong to say she\'s having a midlife crisis; but it might be fair to say she\'s experiencing a midlife contemplation, when questions about her life, and life itself, are paramount.\n\nAt 45 years old, sporting gold-rimmed, aviator-style glasses, Aniston is no longer the ingenue who became a household name at age 25. She has come to terms with a complicated relationship with her mother, has learned to moderate her urge to be always in control and has overcome issues about anger, specifically her longtime history of being ""passive-aggressive.""\n\nHer life is enviable: She\'s rich enough never to have to work again and has a strong partner in actor-writer Justin Theroux, 43, whom she plans to marry soon. And yet she\'s still trying to figure out what it all really means, and as time hurtles by, that\'s growing in importance.\n\n""Time moves really quickly these days, I don\'t know why,"" she says poignantly. ""How many times did our parents say, \'Stop wanting everything to rush\'? You want summer to be over, you want Christmas to be over, you want this to be over, you want everything to be over just so you can get to the next thing. And boy, you really wish you\'d listened to a lot of the things they said.""\n\nShe\'s been through a lot, including her own bout with chronic pain from a pinched nerve in her neck, due to stress, that lasted months and sent her scurrying to specialists. ""I saw this amazing doctor named Alison Tunney who changed my life with this thing called directional nonforce technique,"" she says. ""It\'s like peeling an onion, like peeling years of injuries.""\n\nShe\'s also had to deal with the premature death of a beloved therapist, a barrage of tabloid stories about her fecundity, or lack thereof; and some withering reviews for movies that may have been beneath her talents (The Bounty Hunter, Horrible Bosses 2).\n\nNot least of her woes is the public\'s endless obsession with her split from Brad Pitt, even though it\'s been a decade since their divorce. She\'s been cast in the role of rejected wife, a Debbie Reynolds for the 2000s, eternally perceived as the victim, even if that\'s far from how she sees it.\n\n""We\'re not in daily communication,"" she says. ""But we wish nothing but wonderful things for each other. Nobody did anything wrong. You know what I mean? It was just like, sometimes things [happen]."" She throws up her hands in exasperation. ""If the world only could just stop with the stupid, soap-opera bullshit. There\'s no story. I mean, at this point it\'s starting to become \xe2\x80\x94 please, give more credit to these human beings.""\n\nDespite the divorce, she says she has no hesitation about getting married again and sports a huge diamond engagement ring given to her by Theroux, who lives with her in Bel Air, though no date has been set for the wedding. ""We don\'t have a date,"" she says, then adds slyly, ""I wouldn\'t tell you if we did.""\n\nAs to kids: ""Listen,"" she continues, ""that\'s a topic that\'s so exhausted. I get nervous around that, just because it\'s very personal. Who knows if it\'s going to happen? It\'s been a want. We\'re doing our best.""\n\n***\n\nAniston says she\'s only now learning to deal with anger \xe2\x80\x94 discovering how to express it, rather than keeping it bottled up. ""I always thought, if you\'re angry you just don\'t say anything,"" she says. ""I would come out passive, things would come out passively. But it doesn\'t have to be black or white. You don\'t have to be a hysterical human being and have veins popping out of your neck and turn bright red and terrify people \xe2\x80\x94 or else keep quiet and put your head in the sand. I used to loathe confrontation. Loathe it. It was absolute. I understood anger, but I didn\'t know that you should express it. Which has been something that I\'ve really tried to work on.""\n\nShe\'s also tried to master her need for order. ""I\'m a control freak,"" she admits. ""I like to be in charge of everything. My life was so out of control growing up, it\'s very important today for it to be in control."" Even now, she says, ""I have to bite my tongue sometimes if I\'m on a movie, when I think I can figure out how to make this problem that they\'re having go smoothly. I just bite my tongue, especially with a [bad] director. Some directors are just like \xe2\x80\x94 oh, God, oh God, oh God! I [have to] just suffer through this.""\n\nYears of therapy have helped, though it took Aniston a long time to find someone to replace her favorite therapist, who died of a heart attack several years ago.\n\n""It was at a crazy time, right when we were going through our divorce and everything,"" she recalls. ""But I learned so much in the four years I worked with her, that when she did pass away I remember thinking, \'Wow, everything that we talked about and discussed, it\'s allowed me to be really peaceful about it all.\' I mean, there were human moments. But I was really shockingly OK.""\n\nEverything she did with her therapist, a Jungian who also borrowed from other schools of thought, centered on the fundamental issue of self-assertion, returning Aniston to the theme of anger. ""Her whole thing with me was really saying, \'You have to stand up for yourself in life.\' She was really trying to help me deal with anger and learning how to express it without feeling terrified that I was going to get murdered in response.""\n\nMeditation also has helped, she says, and recently she has been meditating a great deal. Mostly she practices at home rather than following any particular guru. ""I\'m on a really good personal strict regime,"" she notes. ""These days, I\'ve been [doing it] every day. I have a little place at home, and I do it for about 20 minutes, at different times, usually right after a cup of coffee and before the chaos starts."" She\'s found inspiration in the Dalai Lama, though they\'ve never met. ""But I\'d love to meet him. From the things I\'ve read about him, books and lectures, he seems like pure joy, pure, pure, pure enlightenment.""\n\nIf all this might seem a trifle New Age-y, that\'s not the way Aniston comes across. In fact, she seems as self-aware as she is candid, a rather empathetic person struggling to define her life in the glare of a spotlight few of us will ever face.\n\nShe has few heroes she can cite, other than the Dalai Lama. ""They\'re all dead now,"" she observes wistfully, before citing Laurence Olivier, who died in 1989: ""Honestly, I was obsessed [with him] when I was a kid. I just remember being so enamored of him. I remember thinking, \'Maybe someday, if I become an actress, I\'ll be able to work with him.\' And I remember the day he died, crying my eyes out.""\n\nShe seems close to Theroux, who briefly interrupts our interview, dressed in a black leather motorbike jacket, and plants a kiss on her lips. The two met while Aniston was on vacation in Hawaii with her former co-star Courteney Cox and have now been together for four years.\n\n""It was his humor, mainly"" that drew her to Theroux, she says. ""He\'s the easiest guy to hang around. He was so completely in his skin. It was the first time I remember being so comfortable [with a romantic interest], like with all my gay friends.""\n\nShe remains very friendly with Cox, with whom she just spent Christmas Eve, and she says she just saw another Friends co-star, Lisa Kudrow, the day before our interview.\n\nOther than these actresses\' shows, she says, she doesn\'t watch much television anymore, and the TV she watches is rarely a sitcom. She likes NBC Nightly News With Brian Williams, and favorite programs include 60 Minutes, House of Cards, Breaking Bad and Veep.\n\n""And then there\'s junk television,"" she says, smiling, noting she\'s hooked on The Bachelor. ""I\'ll say it out loud. Last year, [friends] were saying, \'It\'s The Bachelor, it\'s premiering tonight! The Bachelor is premiering tonight!\' And I was like, \'Oh, guys! Seriously? The Bachelor? That\'s been on for 15 years or something.\' And Justin and I, just for fun, watched \xe2\x80\x94 and two hours later, we were addicted. It was like junk food. We were sad when it ended.""\n\nShe has a passion for art, and her living room displays paintings by Marc Chagall, Robert Motherwell and conceptual artist Glenn Ligon, the latter of which she bought at a fundraiser for Haiti organized by friend Ben Stiller. ""I used to have an art studio and paint and work with clay, and I actually miss it,"" she says. ""I was moving storage facilities, and I just found my wheel and my easels and all my books. I found all this stuff, so I may build a little art studio off [the house].""\n\nShe doesn\'t read much, the result of the dyslexia that impacted her education and self-image, which wasn\'t diagnosed until she was in her early 20s.\n\n""The only reason I knew [that I had it] was because I went to get a prescription for glasses,"" she recalls. ""I had to wear these Buddy Holly glasses. One had a blue lens and one had a red lens. And I had to read a paragraph, and they gave me a quiz, gave me 10 questions based on what I\'d just read, and I think I got three right. Then they put a computer on my eyes, showing where my eyes went when I read. My eyes would jump four words and go back two words, and I also had a little bit of a lazy eye, like a crossed eye, which they always have to correct in photos.""\n\nThe revelation that she had dyslexia was life-changing. Until then, ""I thought I wasn\'t smart. I just couldn\'t retain anything,"" she says. ""Now I had this great discovery. I felt like all of my childhood trauma-dies, tragedies, dramas were explained.""\n\n***\n\nShe gets up and crosses the room to adjust an ottoman a notch. ""Sorry, I had to move that,"" she says.\n\nAniston grew up largely in New York, the daughter of two actors. (Her father, John, is a longtime star of Days of Our Lives.) Her life was shaken when her parents split, leaving the 9-year-old girl with her mother, Nancy Dow, while her elder brother, John, moved to Los Angeles.\n\nNow, she says regarding her mother, ""We\'re all fine,"" but there were years when they didn\'t speak. ""She had a temper. I can\'t tolerate that. If I get upset, I will discuss [things]. I will never scream and get hysterical like that. [But] I was never taught that I could scream. One time, I raised my voice to my mother, and I screamed at her, and she looked at me and burst out laughing. She was laughing at me [for] screaming back. And it was like a punch in my stomach.""\n\nShe pauses, and then adds: ""She was critical. She was very critical of me. Because she was a model, she was gorgeous, stunning. I wasn\'t. I never was. I honestly still don\'t think of myself in that sort of light, which is fine. She was also very unforgiving. She would hold grudges that I just found so petty.""\n\nAniston herself claims to hold no grudges and is forgiving ""probably to a fault. There are people in my life that are like, \'How do you even talk to that guy?\' But what\'s the point of holding on to [anger]? That\'s so toxic. We\'re human beings. Human beings make mistakes. Human beings are not perfect. And by not forgiving someone, it\'s not allowing human beings to evolve and become better people.""\n\nIn her early years, she turned for support to her father\'s mother, Stella. ""She was a Greek grandmother who just loved me more than anything and was so fun to be around,"" she says. ""She had the best stories, she made me laugh. Beautiful, funny, gorgeous, hysterical \xe2\x80\x94 all the Greeks, all of my Greek family, were."" She spent a year visiting them as a small child, in Athens and Crete, and her grandmother\'s death remains one of the most traumatic moments in her life. ""I was around 21 years old, and it was the first time I\'d had a loss. It was really sad. But then, like anything, you have to move on.""\n\nWhile she grew up Greek Orthodox and was ""dunked in St. Sophia\'s,"" she says she has no strict religion: ""I grew up really seeing a lot of negativity around religion. I actually had quite a beautiful upbringing with it, because it was never pounded down my throat, and I had the joy of going to church and experiencing ceremony and ritual and incense, and I thought it was quite beautiful. But other kids who were from Catholic families, or really strict Christian families \xe2\x80\x94 there was this \'You\'re going to hell\' sort of thing.""\n\nShe wasn\'t a good student, she says, in large part because of the dyslexia. Though that didn\'t improve her self-image, it did push her to develop her innate humor. She was funny at school, and people liked it. Her only passions there were an art class and a workshop where she tried out watercolor and charcoal and could carve creatures such as the wooden lions she still keeps \xe2\x80\x94 and, of course, drama.\n\nAfter acting at school, she got her first work off-Broadway in 1988, when she was still in her late teens. In her early 20s, she moved to Los Angeles and in her mid-20s landed Friends. ""They wanted me to audition for [the part of] Monica, and I read the script and I didn\'t want to do the Monica role,"" she says. ""I wanted to do Rachel.""\n\nThe role made her insanely rich and famous, and in its later years Aniston was paid an astronomical $1 million per episode. But all this is over now, part of another life long gone, and there are no plans for a reunion (though the residuals continue to roll in).\n\n""That\'s completely past,"" she says, with just a hint of nostalgia.\n\n***\n\nCake, for which Aniston received Golden Globe and SAG nominations, put an exclamation point on the present.\n\nIt was a commitment not just to a role but to work itself, showing that even this woman who has so much still seeks something more than money and fame.\n\n""As an accident victim whose nearly every move is excruciating,"" wrote Sheri Linden in the Los Angeles Times, ""Aniston lends the role an impressively agonized physicality and brings ace timing to the screenplay\'s welcome gallows humor.""\n\nUntil the script came along, the actress had been planning to take it easy. ""I\'d been working for the past couple years,"" she says, ""and I was actually thinking: This year would be a nice year to take a break and maybe travel, or do something more on the producorial side, maybe even direct another series of short films."" (She directed an episode of Lifetime\'s 2011 anthology Five.)\n\nBut then she fell in love with the material, which came to her through her managers, Aleen Keshishian and Zack Morgenroth. (She\'s also repped by CAA\'s Kevin Huvane.) To her surprise, the usual suspects of A-list drama stars turned it down, and now Aniston felt she had a chance. She auditioned for director Daniel Barnz, then urged him to give her the role, telling him she would ""go to the moon"" for him.\n\nDeep in her heart, she was convinced she could pull it off. But she also knew there would be many naysayers, and some of their negativity rubbed off. ""I\'ve been told so many times \'You\'re not that type\' that part of me went, \'Am I not? Can I really [do this]?\' So it was like, \'I\'m going to prove it to myself.\' There was a confidence in knowing that I\'m capable of doing this after so many years of being able to \'show up.\' This was the first time I had so many layers to explore. I took out a tool bag I hadn\'t used.""\n\nBarnz, who wrote Aniston an encouraging letter before they met, says he embraced her roots in comedy. ""When I first heard that Jen was interested, I immediately thought of one of my favorite movies, Ordinary People, which featured a [dramatic] performance by an actress primarily known for comedy, Mary Tyler Moore,"" he says. ""I really wanted to find an actress who could bring out all of the warmth and humor of this woman.""\n\nAniston spoke to friends who had dealt with pain \xe2\x80\x94 and even a therapist who specializes in it, who told her that ""people who use drugs with chronic pain, even if the pain has gone, the memory still holds on to it and doesn\'t want to let go [of the solace from painkillers].""\n\nThe 25-day shoot in and around Los Angeles wasn\'t easy, though Barnz and Aniston spent two months in intense conversations about the role before filming began. Aniston drew on her own memories of anguish. The emotions flooded out of her in a way she had never permitted onscreen.\n\nAt one point, she was paralyzed by fear. In a sequence where she submerges herself in a pool in an attempt to see what it would be like to commit suicide, a water phobia she has had all her life proved overpowering. ""I have a terror of water,"" she confesses. ""It took forever. I kept going in, and I\'d have the weirdest Pavlovian thing, and I\'d turn around and go right back up. I was starting to cry. I was really having a lot of anxiety. I\'m like, \'Don\'t cry! Don\'t cry! Don\'t cry!\' And the underwater camera guy came over and said, \'Don\'t do this. Don\'t do this anymore.\' ""\n\nDuring another scene, when the man responsible for the car accident that has left her in so much pain (played by William H. Macy) arrives at her door, Aniston was overwhelmed. ""Seeing the face of that man, I just wanted to beat the shit out of him,"" she says. ""Thankfully, they gave me a stuntman to beat up, because I would have killed Bill. Really. This big guy said, \'You can punch me as hard as you possibly can.\' And I remember seeing white and just beating him for take after take. And the next day, I woke up and couldn\'t move. My body seized [up]. I was like, \'What the f\xe2\x80\x94 did I do?\' ""\n\n***\n\nWhat lies next is unclear. ""In terms of my career, that\'s the thing I\'ve always let come to me,"" she says. ""I\'ve never been strategic. I don\'t have an agenda. I just go with my gut.""\n\nShe says she\'s open to doing theater and even returning to series TV. She also would like to direct a film but hasn\'t encountered the right vehicle. ""I was trying to find a full-length feature, and that almost happened two years ago, and then an acting job arrived, so I couldn\'t do it,"" she says. ""But I have to get that super-excited feeling, and I really promised myself that, unless I feel with all my heart, \'Oh, I have to do this,\' then I just can\'t. There\'s too much to be home for.""\n\nHome, now, is the epicenter of her existence. In some ways, she\'s a homebody who gets great joy from restoring houses, just as she has fixed up the house where we sit this late afternoon. That has much more appeal than uprooting herself for the sake of just another job. ""When you\'re younger and you\'re off for three months, four months, doing a movie God-knows-where, it\'s fine and it\'s a fun experience,"" she says. ""But when you get to a place where you want to be home, and you have a partner, you have to be selective.""\n\nShe pauses to contemplate what she\'s just said. One of her three rescue dogs, an old white shepherd, lopes in and comes up to her, licking her face. She shows him a warmth she rarely reveals to strangers.\n\nThe light is fading. The view from the windows is dark now. One of the two great doors that lead into Aniston\'s fortress-like house opens, and her manager, Keshishian, enters with a colleague. It occurs to me that Aniston resembles this house, so protected on the outside, but with great vistas spreading out once one gets within.\n\nHer life is full to overflowing, but she\'s still searching for the great big thing that will give it meaning as she enters its next phase. Perhaps it\'s a role, perhaps something that has nothing to do with her craft.\n\n""There\'s something bigger I\'m interested in doing,"" she says. ""It could be more work, it could be more creativity, or getting more philanthropic in the world. It can look like a baby. It can look like a foundation. I know I have a bigger purpose. It\'s a puzzle, and I haven\'t quite put the puzzle together. But something greater is calling out to me.""'"

His beautiful new girlfriend Tess Ward allegedly broke up with him, according to a report form The Sun on June 21.

"b'American model and actress\n\nCynthia Ann Crawford (born February 20, 1966) is an American model, actress and businesswoman. Her years of success at modeling made her an international celebrity that have led to roles in television and film as well as other business ventures. During the 1980s and 1990s, Crawford was among the most popular supermodels and a ubiquitous presence on magazine covers, runways, and in fashion campaigns.\n\nEarly life [ edit ]\n\nCynthia Ann Crawford was born in DeKalb, Illinois, on February 20, 1966,[2] the daughter of Dan Crawford and Jennifer Sue Crawford-Moluf (n\xc3\xa9e Walker).[3][4] She has two sisters, Chris and Danielle,[5] as well as a brother, Jeffery, who died of childhood leukemia at age 3.[6] She has stated that her family has been in the United States for generations and that her ancestry is mostly German, English, and French.[7] By appearing in an episode of Who Do You Think You Are? in 2013, she discovered that her ancestors included English nobility and continental royal families of the Middle Ages and that she was descended from Charlemagne.[8]\n\nIn her sophomore year at high school, she received a call from a local clothing store regarding modeling work, only to discover that it was a practical joke set up by two of her classmates. However, the following year another store hired a number of high school girls, including Crawford, to work for them (including a fashion shoot). In her junior year, local photographer Roger Legel, whose duties included photographing a different college girl to be that week\'s coed in the DeKalb Nite Weekly, asked to take her picture for the publication; the result was Crawford\'s first cover.[9] The photo and positive feedback she received were enough to convince her to take up modeling. She entered the Elite Model Management\'s Look of the Year contest at 17 and was the runner-up. Elite Model Management in Chicago then started representing her.\n\nCrawford graduated from DeKalb High School in 1984 as valedictorian.[10] She earned an academic scholarship to study chemical engineering at Northwestern University, which she attended for only one quarter before dropping out in order to pursue a full-time modeling career. After working for photographer Victor Skrebneski in Chicago, Crawford moved to New York City in 1986, and signed with the Elite New York modeling agency.[11]\n\nCareer [ edit ]\n\nDuring the 1980s and 1990s, Crawford was among the most popular supermodels and a ubiquitous presence on magazine covers, runways, and in fashion campaigns. She was repeatedly and frequently featured on the cover of many magazines, including Vogue, W, People, Harper\'s Bazaar, Elle, Cosmopolitan, and Allure. A partial count in 1998 totalled over 500 appearances.[12] Crawford has walked the runways for Chanel, Versace, Dolce & Gabbana, Christian Dior, Calvin Klein, Ralph Lauren, Michael Kors, Todd Oldham, DKNY, and Valentino. Crawford also appeared in many fashion campaigns during her career, including those for Versace, Calvin Klein, Escada, David Yurman, Oscar De La Renta, Balmain, Hermes, Ellen Tracy, Valentino, Bally, Liz Claiborne, Herv\xc3\xa9 Leger, Halston, Anne Klein, Isaac Mizrahi, Blumarine, Guess, Ink, Gap, and Revlon. She has also worked for Omega, Maybelline, Clairol, Pepsi, and Chilean retail stores Ripley (partner of Macy\'s).\n\nIn 1987, Crawford appeared during the opening credits of the Michael J. Fox film The Secret of My Success. Three years later, she appeared alongside top models Christy Turlington, Linda Evangelista, Tatjana Patitz and Naomi Campbell on the cover of the January 1990 edition of British Vogue magazine. Crawford and the other four models subsequently appeared in the video for George Michael\'s hit ""Freedom \'90"" later that year. Subsequently, Crawford played the lost love of Jon Bon Jovi in the 1994 video for his version of ""Please Come Home For Christmas"", ""John Taylor"" in the 2011 video for Duran Duran\'s ""Girl Panic"" (featuring supermodels as the band, including Naomi Campbell as Simon Le Bon), and Headmistress in the 2015 video for Taylor Swift\'s ""Bad Blood"" as part of a cast including Jessica Alba (Domino), Selena Gomez (Arsyn), and fellow models Lily Aldridge, Cara Delevingne, Gigi Hadid, Martha Hunt and Karlie Kloss (as Frostbyte, Mother Chucker, Slay-Z, Homeslice and Knockout respectively).\n\nThe red Versace dress which she wore to the 63rd Academy Awards in 1991 had a major influence on fashion, and many copies and fakes of the dress were produced.[13][14][15] In 1992, Crawford\xe2\x80\x94through GoodTimes Home Video and her company Crawdaddy Productions\xe2\x80\x94made an exercise video with Radu Teodorescu named Cindy Crawford: Shape Your Body; although criticised by some[who?] for being unsafe,[citation needed] it was hugely successful and led to two equally lucrative followups, Cindy Crawford: The Next Challenge in 1993 (again with Radu) and Cindy Crawford: A New Dimension in 2000; the latter, made with fitness expert Kathy Kaehler and produced not long after Crawford gave birth to her first child, was aimed at new mothers getting back into shape. In 2001, Crawford also made a shorter fitness video aimed at children, Mini-Muscles with Cindy Crawford and the Fit-wits, an animated production featuring the voices of Crawford (who also appears at the beginning in live action), Radu and Kobe Bryant.\n\nThe inaugural issue of George, a short lived political magazine in the 1990s, featured Crawford dressed like George Washington on the cover. In 2005, the American Society of Magazine Editors listed it as the 22nd best magazine cover of the last 40 years.[16]\n\nCrawford is 5 feet 9 inches (175 cm) tall[1] with brown hair and eyes. Her measurements are 34\xe2\x80\x9325.5\xe2\x80\x9336"".[17] Crawford\'s trademark is a mole (or ""beauty mark"") above her upper lip. She is so closely associated with this physical feature that she appeared in an Australian advertising campaign for flavoured milk featuring a TV commercial wherein she ""licked off"" her own mole.[18] Her resemblance to model Gia Carangi led her to being known as ""Baby Gia"".[19][20]\n\nCrawford in 1995\n\nCrawford has also been on TV and in films. From 1989 to 1995, Crawford was host and executive producer of MTV\'s House of Style. In the early 1990s, Crawford starred in the Pepsi and Pepsi Stuff advertising.[21][22] In 1992, she appeared in Pepsi\'s Super Bowl commercial,[23] aired during Super Bowl XXVI. In 2016, Pepsi released a remake of the commercial, also featuring Crawford.[23] In 1995, Crawford broke into movies as the female lead in the movie Fair Game. Her performance was panned by critics\xe2\x80\x94Leonard Maltin commented ""In her acting debut, supermodel Crawford makes a good jogger.""[24] The film was also a financial failure, with expenses of $50 million and $11 million takings at the box office. In 2001, she costarred as part of an ensemble cast in The Simian Line. Again the film was not successful or critically acclaimed, but Crawford\'s acting was not criticized. She has had many lesser roles guest starring on TV and as supporting roles, often playing herself. For example, in 2000, she was one of the celebrities (along with Victoria Silvstedt, Anna Falchi and Megan Gale) playing themselves in the Italian comedy Body Guards \xe2\x80\x93 Guardie del corpo. In the 1990s, Carol Shaw, her make-up artist, named a lipstick color after Crawford as a part of the Lorac Cosmetics lip-wear line.[25]\n\nIn July 1988, she posed nude for Playboy magazine in a shoot by photographer Herb Ritts.[26] In October 1998, Crawford returned to the pages of Playboy for a second nude pictorial, again taken by Ritts.[27]\n\nCrawford has consistently ranked highly on lists of the world\'s sexiest people. She was ranked number 5 on Playboy\'s list of the 100 sexiest stars of the 20th century. A 1997 Shape magazine survey of 4,000 picked her as the second (after Demi Moore) most beautiful woman in the world. In 2002, Crawford was named one of the 50 most beautiful people by People magazine. In her forties, she claimed No. 26 in the 2006 Hot 100 issue of Maxim magazine.[28] She was named No. 3 on VH1\'s 40 Hottest Hotties of the 90s and was named one of the ""100 Hottest Women of All-Time"" by Men\'s Health.[29]\n\nAfter modeling [ edit ]\n\nCrawford quit full-time modeling in 2000 and now appears only occasionally in fashion magazines. In 2005, Crawford created a line of beauty products with Jean-Louis Sebagh called Meaningful Beauty for Guthy-Renker.[30] Crawford has stated that she regularly receives certain cosmetic procedures, including Botox and vitamin injections. She first saw a plastic surgeon at the age of 28.[citation needed]\n\nIn 2005, Crawford launched a new line of furniture under the ""Cindy Crawford Home Collection"" name. The collection is manufactured by HM Richards Inc. She assisted in the creation of the line by consulting on the features, colors, or styles that fit the needs of families or reflected her own tastes.[31] She also has a furniture line with Raymour & Flanigan and launched a home goods line with J. C. Penney in late 2009.[32]\n\nCrawford in October 2009\n\nIn 2009, Crawford was one of many celebrities to be photographed by Deborah Anderson for the coffee table book Room 23, produced by philanthropist Diana Jenkins. In addition to appearing in the book, Crawford was the cover model and wrote the dedication.[33]\n\nBecoming, a book about Crawford\'s life and career co-written by Crawford and Katherine O\'Leary, was published in September 2015.[34]\n\nCrawford and her daughter Kaia appeared together on the cover of the April 2016 issue of Vogue Paris.[35] In 2016, she became a spokesperson for Acqua Minerale San Benedetto in Italy.[36]\n\nIn September 2017, Crawford, along with models Claudia Schiffer, Naomi Campbell, Helena Christensen and Carla Bruni, closed the Versace spring/summer 2018 fashion show, which was an homage to the late Gianni Versace.[37]\n\nIn January 2019, Crawford, along with her husband Rande Gerber, Mike Meldman, Jeff Shell, and Jay Sures announced they would purchase the Hollywood deli, Nate \'n Al, to keep its doors open after three generations of family ownership.[38][39]\n\nPersonal life [ edit ]\n\nCrawford was married to actor Richard Gere from 1991 until their divorce in 1995. She married businessman and former model Rande Gerber on May 29, 1998.[40] They have two children, son Presley Walker Gerber (born July 2, 1999)[41] and daughter Kaia Jordan Gerber (born September 3, 2001),[2][42] both of whom went into modeling.[43][44]\n\nActivism and charity work [ edit ]\n\nWhen Crawford was 10 years old, her three-year-old brother Jeff\xe2\x80\x94whom she continues to praise as ""the fourth most influential person in [her] life""\xe2\x80\x94died of leukemia. Since becoming a model, Crawford has made childhood leukemia a focal point of her charity work, donating proceeds of her calendars to medical research.[45] Crawford has been a long-time supporter of the pediatric oncology program at the University of Wisconsin\xe2\x80\x93Madison, where Jeff was treated, stating that she believes he received the best care possible.[46] She is also an honorary board member of the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation.[47]\n\nIn 2007, she became an official supporter of the Ronald McDonald House Charities and is a member of their celebrity board, called the Friends of RMHC.[48] Crawford is on the honorary committee of the California Wildlife Center.[49]\n\nPolitical endorsements [ edit ]\n\nIn 2008, Crawford endorsed Barack Obama for President of the United States.[50] Despite reports, Crawford denied endorsing Mitt Romney for the 2012 election.[51]\n\nFilmography [ edit ]\n\nFilms [ edit ]\n\nVideos [ edit ]\n\nFitness videos [ edit ]\n\nYear Title 1992 Cindy Crawford: Shape Your Body Workout 1993 Cindy Crawford: The Next Challenge Workout 2000 Cindy Crawford: A New Dimension 2001 Mini-Muscles with Cindy Crawford and the Fit-wits\n\nMusic videos [ edit ]\n\nTelevision [ edit ]'"

"b'If, on Wednesday morning, you had risen early enough and rejoined the torrid, infinite march that is Twitter, you might have first learned of NBC\xe2\x80\x99s termination of its morning-news lodestar, Matt Lauer, through neutral channels. At 6:52 A.M., the Times\xe2\x80\x99s media columnist, Jim Rutenberg, tweeted, \xe2\x80\x9cBREAK: NBC Matt Lauer fired, inappropriate workplace behavior . . . story to come.\xe2\x80\x9d But, at 7 A.M., the \xe2\x80\x9cToday in New York\xe2\x80\x9d warmup ended, the friendly corporate bells chimed, and the \xe2\x80\x9cToday\xe2\x80\x9d show, as it has since 1952, started. The minutes in between were a chasm.\n\nStills of Lauer\xe2\x80\x94bespectacled and reviewing notes in one, professorially inquisitive in another\xe2\x80\x94crossed the screen as the voice of his co-anchor, Savannah Guthrie, announced the breaking news that Lauer\xe2\x80\x99s employment had been terminated overnight, after an employee had come forward on Monday \xe2\x80\x9creporting behavior in violation of our company\xe2\x80\x99s standards.\xe2\x80\x9d Guthrie\xe2\x80\x99s voice trembled as the camera captured the tableau\xe2\x80\x94Guthrie and her guest co-anchor, Hoda Kotb, palpably sombre, the Popsicle-orange \xe2\x80\x9cToday\xe2\x80\x9d show logo floating between them. Guthrie clasped Kotb\xe2\x80\x99s hand. She read the entirety of a statement from the NBC News chairman, Andrew Lack, which was composed in the corporate \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x9d: \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x9d had reason to believe that the employee\xe2\x80\x99s complaint wasn\xe2\x80\x99t an isolated incident; \xe2\x80\x9cwe were deeply saddened by this turn of events\xe2\x80\x9d; \xe2\x80\x9cwe will face it together as a news organization\xe2\x80\x94and do it in as transparent a manner as we can.\xe2\x80\x9d Then Guthrie and Kotb offered their personal expressions of shock and dismay. Lauer had been loved by so many; \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x9d loved him. \xe2\x80\x9cAs I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you can imagine, we are devastated,\xe2\x80\x9d Guthrie said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re trying to process it and make sense of it, and it\xe2\x80\x99ll take some time for that,\xe2\x80\x9d Kotb said. Expressions of disorientation not dissimilar from expressions of mourning continued for the rest of the show. As Rebecca Traister wrote earlier this month, a \xe2\x80\x9cpowerful white man losing a job is a death.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWe have witnessed a theatre of accountability insidiously refine itself, quite quickly, in the past few months. Louis C.K.\xe2\x80\x99s statement, for example, following the expos\xc3\xa9 in the Times of his sexual harassment of female comics, was not as passionate as, but was more coherent than, Harvey Weinstein\xe2\x80\x99s ramblings about Jay-Z and the gun lobby. The opportunistic finesse of Kevin Spacey\xe2\x80\x99s coming-out certainly tripped some social alarms, but he nonetheless garnered some sympathy. Power brokers like the Pixar animation baron John Lasseter have even scooped long-labored-over articles by pre\xc3\xabmpting them altogether. (Lasseter is taking a six-month leave of absence.) No display was savvier than NBC\xe2\x80\x99s orchestration on Wednesday.\n\nThe \xe2\x80\x9cToday\xe2\x80\x9d show\xe2\x80\x99s artful transposition of grief where there would naturally be scrutiny continued into the 10 A.M. slot, in which the veteran host Kathie Lee Gifford spoke of how much she, too, loved Lauer and how sad she was. It continued on this morning\xe2\x80\x99s program, with Guthrie and Kotb again at the helm. Not since Bill Cosby\xe2\x80\x94or Bill O\xe2\x80\x99Reilly, depending on one\xe2\x80\x99s television diet\xe2\x80\x94has the scourge of sexual assault so acutely infiltrated the righteous perimeter of the American home. (President Trump, also affiliated with NBC and accused of assaulting women, never quite depended on a family-man image.) The influence of a behind-the-scenes figure like Weinstein can feel diffuse, removed from our everyday cultural consumption; Lauer was, and is, synonymous with the family feel of \xe2\x80\x9cToday.\xe2\x80\x9d Part of this comes from the network\xe2\x80\x99s bloated investment in Lauer\xe2\x80\x94he reportedly earns between twenty million and twenty-five million dollars a year. (In 2014, a source told Page Six that the company chartered helicopter rides for Lauer from his Hamptons compound to its Rockefeller Center studios at his request.) When, in 1996, Lauer wrested the anchor chair from Bryant Gumbel, gossip magazines swooned over his geometric jaw and feathery hair; twenty years later, he was transforming comfortably into a smug but wise paternal figure. His tenure at the \xe2\x80\x9cToday\xe2\x80\x9d show was the longest in its history. Now instances of Lauer\xe2\x80\x99s public pettiness toward women seem like the exertions of a holistically awful campaign. In 2012, he admonished the actress Anne Hathaway for photographs that the paparazzi had taken of her exiting a car. \xe2\x80\x9cSeen a lot of you lately,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. And, famously, Lauer was an architect of \xe2\x80\x9cOperation Bambi,\xe2\x80\x9d a plan that succeeded in getting his former co-anchor Ann Curry fired from the show that same year. (\xe2\x80\x9c \xe2\x80\x98Chemistry,\xe2\x80\x99 in television history, generally means the man does not want to work with the woman,\xe2\x80\x9d Curry said, according to Brian Stelter\xe2\x80\x99s insider anatomy, \xe2\x80\x9cTop of the Morning: Inside the Cutthroat World of Morning TV.\xe2\x80\x9d) On her final show, Curry wept and Lauer pretended to soothe her. His interview of Hillary Clinton last year was intrusive and aggressive when compared with his handling of Trump. How a man thinks of women dictates how he works with them.\n\nThe stakes with Lauer, as with Charlie Rose, who was fired from both CBS and PBS last week, for sexual harassment, threaten the geniality and social integrity that are the trade of the morning-show apparatus. And so it is no surprise that, to convey something like moral mooring to a vastly female audience, the networks rely on women anchors to break the public fall. An ether of remorse already fogs the perception of Lauer\xe2\x80\x99s ousting, though Lauer waited a day to issue a statement and in it said, \xe2\x80\x9cSome of what is being said about me is untrue or mischaracterized, but there is enough truth in these stories to make me feel embarrassed and ashamed.\xe2\x80\x9d It seems likely that, at least when it comes to the fact of Lauer\xe2\x80\x99s firing, Guthrie had truly been caught off guard. The company, however, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t; reporters at Variety and the Times had spent months investigating claims against Lauer. Guthrie\xe2\x80\x99s vulnerable pose conferred an unearned armament to a company that had employed a reckless man for two decades. The woman anchor\xe2\x80\x99s surprise becomes the network\xe2\x80\x99s surprise; her sorrow, its sorrow. \xe2\x80\x9cHow do you reconcile your love for someone with the revelation that they behaved badly?\xe2\x80\x9d Guthrie asked, her eyes glassy. For her, and for Gayle King, who asked a similar question when reporting on her co-host Rose\xe2\x80\x99s transgressions last week, on CBS, the question of loyalty may be relevant. (It was Lauer who lobbied for Guthrie\xe2\x80\x99s co-anchorship, in 2012, following the success of \xe2\x80\x9cOperation Bambi.\xe2\x80\x9d) But neither love nor loyalty nor sadness excuses NBC, the company that passed on its own employee\xe2\x80\x99s reportage of Weinstein\xe2\x80\x99s abuse of women. The Variety report on Lauer, published on Wednesday afternoon, included accounts of harassment from three unnamed women. It showed an emboldened player whose harmful wiles were accommodated by the network around him. The news mediates the news.\n\nOne detail from Ramin Setoodeh and Elizabeth Wagmeister\xe2\x80\x99s reporting in Variety mentions a contraption, apparently common in the offices of executives of his stature, that in this context sounds like something used by a villain from a Bond film. The installation of a button under Lauer\xe2\x80\x99s desk made it possible for him to lock himself, and anyone else who might have been invited into his office, inside, without getting up from his seat. The Times reported that NBC on Wednesday had received at least two more complaints from employees about Lauer\xe2\x80\x99s behavior. One woman told the Times that Lauer locked her in his office in 2001: \xe2\x80\x9cShe said the anchor then stepped out from behind his desk, pulled down her pants, bent her over a chair and had intercourse with her.\xe2\x80\x9d She passed out and was taken to a nurse by Lauer\xe2\x80\x99s assistant. Reading the article, I wondered who had seen that commotion, and I thought about the lock, an instrument of security turned into an instrument of violence.'"

When she refused ... Karrueche says Chris became aggressive.\n\nKarrueche explained that in text messages between herself and Chris post-breakup, he would say things like ""I\'m not being nice to you no more, if I see you out in public again and I\'m there I will make you hate me even more, don\'t be anywhere I\'m out in public, I\'m going to ban you from all events.""\n\nShe claims he also texted her more violent threats like ...

"b""Two blacked-out limousines swish to a halt outside a modest three-bedroom house on the flats of Beverly Hills. Paint peeling from the walls, rubbish bins left outside on the street\xe2\x80\xa6 it is the last place on Earth you'd expect to see two of the biggest stars on the planet.\n\nFrom one car emerges Angelina Jolie, her face devoid of make-up, long hair pulled back into a severe ponytail. Moments later, her estranged husband Brad Pitt steps out of the second vehicle and hurries quickly up the tarmac drive.\n\nIt was then, just seven weeks ago, that 'Brangelina', as the world has come to know Hollywood's the most famous couple, stood face-to-face for the first time in ten months. 'Brad took the first step forward,' says the couple's biographer Ian Halperin. 'Then they collapsed into each other's arms.'\n\nTempestuous relationships: Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor in 1969 during the first of their two marriages. Right: Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie at the 2014 Oscars, two years before their marital bust-up\n\nThe stars, safely away from prying eyes at the home of a friend, then went inside for an emotional heart-to-heart that put aside the months of acrimony and mud-slinging that destroyed the fairytale image of the couple who fell passionately in love on the set of the 2005 film Mr & Mrs Smith.\n\n'There were a lot of tears,' Halperin adds. 'Nothing was left on the table. They had it out, right there and then in this very modest house. In that moment they decided to make a fresh start. It was a 'come to Jesus meeting' that marked the beginning of a new phase in their relationship.'\n\nWhen the couple split last September amid toxic allegations of drink, drugs and a mid-air altercation between Pitt and their teenage son Maddox \xe2\x80\x93 which resulted in brief investigations by the FBI and social services \xe2\x80\x93 the rift in their relationship seemed as final as it was sudden.\n\nBut the 'tough love' meeting arranged by the couple's divorce negotiator gave them a chance to talk in the presence of a 'referee' who helped them cut through the acrimony and recrimination. Their conclusion was that, like a latter-day Liz Taylor and Richard Burton, they still loved each other and wanted to try again.\n\nOn-screen chemistry: Pitt and Jolie, left, in 2005\xe2\x80\x99s Mr & Mrs Smith \xe2\x80\x93 the pair reportedly fell in love on the set. Right: Burton and Taylor in the 1962 classic Cleopatra\n\nToday, The Mail on Sunday can reveal that they are, in fact, working to 'consciously re-couple' and have undergone intensive rehab and spiritual counselling sessions in an effort to start anew.\n\nTogether with their six children, three biological and three adopted, 'Brangelina' have long been considered the most passionate \xe2\x80\x93 and lucrative \xe2\x80\x93 showbusiness couple since Burton and Taylor, whose tempestuous relationship famously resulted in two marriages and two divorces in the 1960s and 1970s. Indeed, there are remarkable parallels. When the Brangelina marriage imploded spectacularly a year ago, few thought it could recover.\n\n'Angie was very, very angry about the incident on the private plane between Brad and Maddox,' says Halperin, whose new documentary, Broken: The Incredible Story Of Brangelina, will be broadcast in the UK later this year. 'She threw everything she had at him\n\n'It was toxic. I've spoken to many people around them, friends and family, and no one could see how they could possibly recover. But both of them realise they are happier together than apart. Once they cleared the air between them, things started to improve.\n\nToday, they are both feeling very positive. Angelina sees them as very much the new Burton and Taylor. They can't live together but they can't live apart. She has worked hard on herself since the plane incident, and so has Brad. They are still in love with each other.'\n\nIndeed, the couple have even joked they are 'consciously re-coupling', a tongue-in-cheek reference to Gwyneth Paltrow's famous and much ridiculed comment when she and Coldplay singer Chris Martin split in 2014 that they were 'consciously uncoupling'.\n\nHalperin says sources within the Brangelina camp have even told him the divorce may still go ahead, but that 'a piece of paper' means little to the couple.\n\n'Angie believes everything started to go wrong after they tied the knot. Their relationship shifted, it became boring. Brad's drinking escalated. They both had heavy work schedules and they were constantly travelling around as a family. Tensions grew.\n\nThey both view divorce as not the worst thing that can happen. It's only a piece of paper and they feel once the divorce is done, they have a clean sheet and can start their lives anew.'\n\nIndeed, the pair, who met when Pitt was still married to Friends star Jennifer Aniston, are 'sexual dynamite', according to one source. 'That powerful sexual attraction never wavered. Even when they were having the worst fights, they would always kiss and make up. They were happier before marriage. They only married because the kids begged them to. Now they realise what a mistake that was.'\n\nPax Jolie-Pitt, Vivienne Jolie-Pitt, Angelina Jolie, Shiloh Jolie-Pitt, Maddox Jolie-Pitt, Knox Jolie-Pitt, Zahara Jolie-Pitt, Brad Pitt in 2015\n\nBoth sides have insisted on certain conditions for the relationship to be given a second chance. The constant presence of Jolie's brother James Haven, whom she once kissed on the lips at the Oscars, is said by friends to have inflamed the marital discord\n\n'James was the 'manny'. He was at the marital home 24/7 and became a de facto father figure to the kids which Brad, a traditionalist, didn't take well to at all,' explains Halperin, who spent five years working on his definitive bestselling 2010 biography of the couple, Brangelina: The Untold Story.\n\nAlso to be sidelined is Jolie's 'British coven': Baroness Arminka Helic and Chloe Dalton, who both worked for ex-Tory leader William Hague and who became close to Jolie through her UN philanthropic work. 'They are strong, powerful women who exercised undue influence on her,' a friend of Pitt said. 'Brad felt they meddled in the marriage.\n\n'The endless travelling is also going to stop. Brad already has unlimited access to the children and he has vowed to be a more active and present father. They both want to be there for their kids and, of course, the children want nothing more than to see their parents reunite,' says Halperin.\n\nBoth have made a fresh start geographically. Jolie recently moved into a \xc2\xa319 million mansion in Los Feliz, an area of Los Angeles more arty and less stuffy than the traditional environs of Beverly Hills, where the couple's \xc2\xa315 million marital home sits empty.\n\nBurton and Taylor with their children in 1967. Both Pitt and Jolie have insisted on certain conditions for the relationship to be given a second chance\n\nJolie's new home once belonged to one of the 'founders' of modern Hollywood, studio boss Cecil B. DeMille. It enjoys panoramic views over the city and boasts six bedrooms, ten bathrooms and 2.1 acres of gardens.\n\nPitt, meanwhile, is living in a relatively modest \xc2\xa31 million bungalow close to Jolie's new digs and is said to be employing a 'sober coach' to be with him 24/7.\n\nHalperin says friends have seen a 'radical shift' in 42-year-old Jolie, a woman who has openly admitted suffering emotional trauma from her own parents' divorce when she was just three years old, causing a 'downward spiral' into heroin addiction and eating disorders.\n\nHer mother Marcheline, to whom she was extremely close, died of cancer in 2007, and Angelina was estranged from her actor father Jon Voight for many years until, at the urging of Pitt, the pair reconciled 18 months ago. Jolie was photographed with Voight last month taking nine-year-old daughter Vivienne to an art shop.\n\nIn a recent interview with Vanity Fair magazine, the actress said she and the children \xe2\x80\x93 Maddox, 16, Pax, 13, Zahara, 12, Shiloh, 11, and nine-year-old twins Knox and Vivienne \xe2\x80\x93 had been going through 'the hardest time', adding: 'We're all trying our best to heal our family.'\n\nConsidering both are now the most eligible singles in Hollywood, neither appears to have actively sought out a new partner. Pitt, 53, was spotted cosying up to Sienna Miller at Glastonbury this summer but both denied any romance.\n\n'Brad hasn't got eyes for anyone else and nor has Angie,' says Halperin. When they split, Jolie's team set out to paint Pitt as a villain. 'They ran a smear campaign,' says one insider.\n\nPitt was accused of having an affair with Allied co-star Marion Cotillard, an allegation both vehemently denied. 'Angie's anger has gone,' says Halperin. 'She's starting to realise Brad's a great dad and a great man.\n\n'The main issue in the marriage was Brad's drinking and pot-smoking,' he adds. 'One of the things that has impressed Angie the most has been his commitment to getting clean and sober.'\n\nIn an interview with GQ magazine, a visibly shaken Pitt took 'full responsibility' for the marriage breakdown, blaming his dependence on alcohol and marijuana for the explosive row with 16-year-old Maddox. He cut a much slimmer figure as he started work in LA on a new film a few days ago, the \xc2\xa335 million sci-fi thriller Ad Astra.\n\nJolie, meanwhile, has been paying thrice-weekly visits to a Beverly Hills 'spiritual counsellor'.\n\n'The Angelina of today is in the best place ever,' a source close to the star said. 'She's calm, less prone to erratic behaviour, and open to making the relationship with Brad her priority. She adores him and always has. She wants her children to have the stability she never had.'\n\nThe pair, who own other homes in France, Los Angeles, Santa Barbara, New Orleans and New York, also realise the value of 'brand Brangelina' \xe2\x80\x93 conservatively valued at more than \xc2\xa3100 million, according to Forbes magazine.\n\n'They have always lived the high life and their earning potential as a couple far exceeds their potential as individuals,' adds Halperin. 'Money isn't high on the list of priorities for either of them, but avoiding a nasty fight over money is an added bonus. They've pretty much divided their marital assets evenly and are now back to being independent of each other financially.'\n\nWhatever happens, both stars believe their story is not over. 'Hollywood loves a 'happily ever after' ending,' says Halperin. 'And no one wants it more than Brad and Angie.'"""

"b'2017 single by Luis Fonsi featuring Daddy Yankee\n\n""Despacito"" ( American Spanish: [despa\'sito]; transl. ""Slowly"") is a song by Puerto Rican singer Luis Fonsi featuring Puerto Rican rapper Daddy Yankee from Fonsi\'s 2019 studio album Vida.[1][2] Released on January 12, 2017, the song was written by Fonsi, Erika Ender, and Daddy Yankee, and produced by Mauricio Rengifo and Andr\xc3\xa9s Torres. A remix version featuring Canadian singer Justin Bieber was released on April 17, 2017, which helped to improve the song\'s chart performance in numerous countries, including various number-one positions. ""Despacito"" has been widely credited by music journalists as being instrumental in popularizing Spanish-language pop music in the mainstream market again.\n\nIt is a reggaeton and Latin pop song composed in common time with lyrics about desiring a sexual relationship, performed in a smooth and romantic way. ""Despacito"" received generally favorable reviews from music critics, who praised the fusion between Latin and urban rhythms, its catchiness, and its text painting. It has received Latin Grammy Awards for Record of the Year, Song of the Year, Best Urban Fusion/Performance, and Best Short Form Music Video at the 18th Latin Grammy Awards. ""Despacito"" has been also ranked among the best Latin songs of all-time and the best songs of 2017 by various publications, which referred to it as one of the most successful Spanish-language tracks in pop music history.\n\nThe song topped the charts of 47 countries and reached the top 10 of six others. In the United States, it became the first song primarily in Spanish to top the Billboard Hot 100 since Los del R\xc3\xado\'s ""Macarena"" in 1996, subsequently tying the longest-reigning number one on the Billboard Hot 100 at the time with 16 weeks, as well as becoming the longest-running number-one on the Hot Latin Songs chart with 56 weeks. It also became the first Latin song to receive a diamond certification by the Recording Industry Association of America. The music video shows both artists performing the song in La Perla neighborhood of Old San Juan, Puerto Rico and local bar La Factor\xc3\xada. It was the most-viewed YouTube video of all-time from August 2017 to November 2020. It became the first video on the site to reach the milestones of three, four, five, six, and seven billion views.\n\nBackground [ edit ]\n\npictured) co-wrote the song. Panamanian singer and songwriter Erika Ender ) co-wrote the song.\n\nThe lyrics of ""Despacito"" were written in late 2015 in Luis Fonsi\'s house in Miami because he wanted to record a ""swinging song"" for his new album after two years without releasing new music.[3][4] He woke up mulling about ""a song called \'Despacito\'"" and invited Brazilian-Panamanian singer and songwriter Erika Ender to a songwriting session.[5] Fonsi co-wrote the song on a Gibson Emmylou Harris guitar.[6] He originally composed it as a cumbia and pop song with lyrics written as a ballad but decided to give it an ""urban injection"" and sent a demo to reggaeton artist Daddy Yankee.[4] They recorded the song at Noisematch Studios in Miami in late 2016.[7][8] Daddy Yankee improvised his verse in a corner of the studio\'s control room while thinking about his father playing bongos and wrote the post-chorus.[8][9] It was produced by Mauricio Rengifo and Andr\xc3\xa9s Torres; the former is known as a member of Colombian pop duo Cali & El Dandee and the latter is known for previously working with David Bisbal, Thal\xc3\xada, and Ricky Martin.[10][11] It was mixed by American engineer Jaycen Joshua at Larrabee Sound Studios in North Hollywood, Los Angeles.[12]\n\nLuis Fonsi does not consider it a reggaeton song but feels that ""it does have a reggaeton energy and an subtle urban beat.""[4] Ender stated that the track ""went through several arrangements"" until Fonsi got ""exactly the arrangement he wanted.""[5] Fonsi described ""Despacito"" as a very melodic song that can adapt well to many other music genres.[13] Due to the sensual nature of the song, they ""needed to be responsible with a good lyric"" and Ender\'s approach to writing for Fonsi was ""to take care of how to say things with a good taste.""[3] In April 2017, American singer and songwriter Nicky Jam revealed that the original version of ""Despacito"" featured him instead of Daddy Yankee, but had to decline due to the song\'s release interfering with the launch of his album F\xc3\xa9nix.[14]\n\nJustin Bieber remix version [ edit ]\n\nThree months after the release of ""Despacito"", Canadian singer Justin Bieber wanted to record a remix version after seeing how people reacted to the song in a Colombian nightclub during a tour in South America.[15] The following day, Luis Fonsi received a phone call from Universal Latin about the remix and authorized the label to send the track to Bieber.[16] Bieber\'s manager Scooter Braun contacted his vocal producer Josh Gudwin to work on the song, who flew to Bogot\xc3\xa1 and recorded Justin Bieber\'s vocals in Estudios Audiovisi\xc3\xb3n.[17]\n\nJustin Bieber sang in Spanish for the first time in his career with the help of Colombian musician Juan Felipe Samper.[18][19] What cost Justin Bieber the most was the \'ere\' (\xc9\xbe) sound in words like ""laberinto"" (labyrinth), ""paredes"" (walls) and ""manuscrito"" (manuscript).[19] Samper wrote the Spanish-language lyrics phonetically to ease Bieber\'s pronunciation, which was ""perfectly"" achieved in two hours.[19] After a four-hour recording session, Gudwin sent Bieber\'s vocal tracks to Australian sound engineer Chris O\'Ryan for vocal tuning.[17] Gudwin concluded the remix\'s production in Parrot Cay, Turks and Caicos Islands with the mixing of Luis Fonsi\'s English-language vocals, whose lyrics were written by American songwriter Marty James.[17] The entire process until the release date took six days.[17] In June 2017, English musician Ed Sheeran revealed that he wanted to record a remix version of the song but lost out to Justin Bieber.[20]\n\nComposition [ edit ]\n\n""Despacito"" is a reggaeton and Latin pop song composed in common time (4\n\n4 time) with a length of three minutes and forty-seven seconds and written in the key of B minor with a tempo of 89 beats per minute and a common chord progression of Bm\xe2\x80\x94G\xe2\x80\x94D\xe2\x80\x94A.[21][22][23] The vocals span from F# 4 to A 5 .[24] Its implicit lyrics are about having a sexual relationship in a smooth and romantic way, making heavy use of allegories.[25] However, Luis Fonsi expressed that some lines are free for interpretation.[26]\n\n""Despacito"" A 22-second sample of ""Despacito"" featuring part of the chorus. Problems playing this file? See media help.\n\nMauricio Rengifo and Andr\xc3\xa9s Torres produced ""Despacito"" using Pro Tools and the final mix consisted of 47 tracks.[27] The song begins with a Puerto Rican cuatro played by Christian Nieves, which is accompanied by an acoustic guitar played by Torres when Luis Fonsi starts performing.[27] Rengifo stated that the guitar ""was actually played, but then [they] chopped it and made it really digital.""[27] The producers decided to record a cuatro because they wanted ""to feel very Puerto Rican and ethnic"" and that it ""gives the song a really unique character.""[27] Nieves played salsa-influenced melodies during the chorus and the hook, which contains ""old school pop"" effects based on American producer Dr. Luke.[27] Percussion instruments guache and g\xc3\xbcira were synchronized with a hi hat in order to highlight the track\'s cumbia influences.[27]\n\nThe song uses the side-chaining production technique in order to make the chorus ""more prominent,"" silencing the music as the kick drum hits.[28] It also makes heavy use of text painting when the music is slowed down as the word ""despacito"" (slowly) is performed at the beginning of every chorus.[28] Its percussion consists of guache, cowbell, timbales, g\xc3\xbcira, and sequenced drum patterns.[27] The remix featuring Justin Bieber maintained the original rhythms and Luis Fonsi translated some lines to English, singing a verse in Spanglish, while Daddy Yankee\'s verses were kept from the original version.[18]\n\nRelease and reception [ edit ]\n\n""Despacito"" was made available for digital download on January 13, 2017 by Universal Music Latin. Some music publications believed the single\'s success was influenced by a trend of combining Latin pop and urban music.[29] Fonsi referred to it as ""the new pop"" and Ender said that ""everyone is making this type of fusions.""[3] Luis Fonsi also stated that two weeks after the release of the song and its music video he started receiving calls from ""people who normally don\'t call, people who only call when something different is going on."" He got calls from Ricky Martin, Juan Luis Guerra, Marc Anthony and other artists telling him that the track was a ""home run.""[30]\n\nSebastian Wernke-Schmiesing of Dance-Charts journal stated that ""a simple 4/4 time, Spanish guitar sounds, a crisp bass, and the excellent vocals by Luis Fonsi and [Daddy Yankee] were enough to get a hit single from the start.""[31] Leila Cobo of Billboard praised its ""undeniable immediate catchiness"" and wrote that the song ""is a clever blend of romantic Latin pop with a reggaeton beat and subtly naughty lyrics.""[32][33] Robert Joffred of Medium\'s culture blog That Good You Need highlighted the use of a steel-string guitar to play flamenco-style melodies instead of a nylon-string guitar, as well as the presence of ""swung rhythms"" when the word ""Despacito"" is sung at the beginning of the chorus[28] He referred to the text painting as ""pretty genius.""[28] Raisa Bruner of Time magazine described the single as ""an infectious Latin melody amped up with reggaeton grooves and an irresistible dance tune.""[34]\n\nSpanish record producer Nah\xc3\xbam Garc\xc3\xada stated that ""the way the rhythm breaks before the chorus is genius"" and that this ""trick"" in particular is not common in pop music.[35] Joshua Barrie of Irish Mirror gave a negative opinion about the lyrics, referring to them as ""quite rude and a bit creepy"" and stating that ""some people might find them offensive.""[36] On the other hand, an editor of Spanish music website Jenesaispop stated that ""the melody is very good, the lyrics are sexy without being vulgar and above all its structure is interesting.""[37] Felix Contreras of National Public Radio praised the writing, arrangement and performances.[38]\n\nThe remix version featuring Justin Bieber was released on April 17, 2017 by Universal Music Latin, Republic Records, Def Jam Recordings, RBMG and School Boy Records.[39] Its official audio video garnered 20 million views on YouTube on its first 24 hours, making it the third-highest debut for a music-related video in 2017 as of September.[40] Caroline Soriano of Ernstars magazine stated that Bieber\'s voice ""sounds appealing with the song,"" whose remix version make it sound ""a little bit better.""[41] Mike Senior of Sound on Sound gave a negative review of the remix\'s mixing by criticizing its polarity inversion regarding the original version and Justin Bieber\'s louder vocal track than Daddy Yankee\'s.[42] As to the original version, Senior referred to the first appearance of the ""Despacito"" hook line as a ""masterstroke"".[42]\n\nIn July 2017, officials from the Government of Malaysia reported that ""Despacito"" was being banned from airing on government-owned broadcast stations as a result of public complaints.[43] Government ministers said that the song was considered un-Islamic and that its lyrics were ""not suitable to be heard.""[43]\n\nAccolades [ edit ]\n\n""Despacito"" has received various awards and nominations following its commercial success. In 2017, the original version won three awards at the 18th Latin Grammy Awards including Record of the Year, Song of the Year and Best Short Form Music Video, while the remix version won Best Urban

nomination.[49][16]\n\nBillboard\'s critics ranked the original version the fourth best song of 2017 and the fifth best Latin song of all-time, referring to it as ""one of the biggest hits in Latin music history"" and ""one of the biggest singles of all-time.""[50][51] Rolling Stone and Time selected it as the seventh and third best song of 2017, respectively; the latter stating that ""in a year

of the year, stating that ""it managed to transcend genre, time, space, and even personal taste in a way that was unprecedented.""[53] It was also included among the 100 best singles of 2017 by PopSugar,[54] The New York Times,[55] National Public Radio,[38] The Village Voice,[56] and The Guardian.[57] Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee were selected as the ""Stars of the Year"" by People en

describing it as ""one of the most successful hits in pop music history.""[59][60] Billboard selected it among the best Latin summer songs of all-time and included it among the 100 songs that defined the 2010s decade.[61][62] The song was inducted to the 2019 edition of the Guinness World Records for achieving seven milestones.[63]\n\nCommercial performance [ edit ]\n\nUnited States [ edit ]\n\nIn

ranked within the top 10 of the Hot 100 simultaneously.[76] The song spent 52 weeks on the Hot 100 and was removed through a recurrent rule.[77]\n\n""Despacito"" was the best-selling and most-streamed single of 2017 in the United States, with 2,692,000 downloads sold and 1,322,799,000 streams.[78][79] It was also the sixth most-played song of 2017, with 608,000 spins across US radio stations and an audience of 3,076,935,000.[79] It ranked at number two on the Hot 100 year-end chart and was the best-performing single on Hot Latin Songs for two years in a row in 2017 and 2018.[80][81][82] In the United States, the single sold 2,983,000 downloads as of June 20, 2019[a] and received a 13\xc3\x97 platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on January 6, 2020 for units of over 13 million sales plus track-equivalent streams, making it the highest-certified single of all-time in the United States.[86] It became the first Latin and 18th overall single to receive a diamond certification by the RIAA.[87] It was the ninth best-performing single of the 2010s decade on the Hot 100 and was ranked at number one on the Hot Latin Songs chart.[88][89] It is the best-performing track of all-time on Hot Latin Songs and the 33rd best-performing on the Hot 100.[90][91]\n\nInternational [ edit ]\n\nInternationally, ""Despacito"" has topped the charts of 47 countries, including the original version alone and combined chart entries with the remix version featuring Justin Bieber.[92][93] The song spent 26 weeks at number one in Spain,[94] 20 in Switzerland,[95] 18 in France,[96] 17 Germany,[97] 16 in Canada,[98][99] 14 in Italy,[100] 13 in Australia[101] and 11 in the United Kingdom, among others.[102] Across Europe, the song was certified 13\xc3\x97 platinum in Sweden[103] and Spain,[104] diamond in France[105] and Italy[106] and 4\xc3\x97 platinum in the United Kingdom[107] and Germany, among others.[108] It also received a diamond certification in Canada[109] and a 5\xc3\x97 platinum certification in Australia.[110] In Latin America, it was certified 6\xc3\x97 diamond in Brazil[111] and 5\xc3\x97 diamond and 4\xc3\x97 platinum in Mexico.[112] The remix version alone topped the charts of five countries and was certified platinum in New Zealand[113] and Brazil[111] and gold in Germany.[114]\n\nIn the United Kingdom, ""Despacito"" was the second best-selling and most-streamed song of the year, with 2.3 million combined sales.[115][116] It was also the best-selling single of 2017 in Canada, with more than 300,000 digital sales.[117] It topped the 2017 year-end charts of 16 countries and was the second best-performing song in 15 others. In Latin America, it was the most-played radio song of 2017, with 580,450 spins, as well as the best-performing foreign song of the year in Brazil.[118][119] ""Despacito"" was the second best-selling single of 2017 across the world, with 24.3 million sales plus track-equivalent streams.[120][121] In 2018, it was the sixth best-selling song of the year, with 11.8 million sales plus track-equivalent streams, and was the 72nd most-played song in Latin America, with 107,980 spins.[122]\n\n""Despacito"" became the world\'s most-streamed song of all-time in July 2017, with 4.6 billion streams between the original and remix version.[123] It was streamed 7.5 billion times as of April 2018.[92] The remix version became the first primarily-Spanish-language song to surpass one billion streams on Spotify in February 2018, while the original became the first non-English single to reach the milestone in June 2019.[124][125] In the United Kingdom, it became the longest-reigning foreign language number-one and is the 30th best-selling single in the country with 1,900,599 combined sales as of September 19, 2017.[102][126] It also became the song with most weeks at number one in Switzerland and Germany.[127]\n\nImpact [ edit ]\n\nThe success of the song and its remix version led Daddy Yankee to become the most listened-to artist worldwide on streaming service Spotify on July 9, 2017, being the first Latin artist to do so.[128] He later became the sixth most listened-to artist of 2017 on Spotify.[129] ""Despacito"" was cited by Billboard\'s Leila Cobo as the song that renewed interest in the Latin music market from recording labels in the United States.[130] Xander Zellner of Billboard credited the influence of the single\'s success for the Latin music domination in the US mainstream market during 2017, as 11 primarily-Spanish-language songs debuted on the Hot 100.[76] American songwriter Desmond Child and Cuban musician Rudy P\xc3\xa9rez expressed that ""not since Ricky Martin\'s \'Livin\' La Vida Loca\' has there been a song in any genre that has had the global impact of \'Despacito\', changing the course of pop music forever.""[49] In 2017, six out of the 10 most-viewed YouTube music videos were for songs performed in Spanish by Latin artists and Billboard\'s Lars Brandle referred to it as ""the \'Despacito\' effect.""[131]\n\nBritish Official Charts Company recognized it as the song that ""helped Latin pop crossover to the mainstream once again.""[132] Nielsen\'s Erin Crawford stated that the track had ""a halo effect on several other Latin hits ripe for crossover success"", most notably on J Balvin and Willy William\'s ""Mi Gente""[79] Rolling Stone stated that the song ""hastened a massive historical turn in American music, demonstrating the mainstream viability of Spanish-language pop.""[59] John Ochoa of Rolling Stone stated that ""the resulting so-called \'Despacito effect\' has advanced a wave of subsequent Spanish-language hits and mainstream crossovers.""[60]\n\nThe Recording Industry Association of America reported that Latin music revenues grew 37% in 2017, mostly due to music streaming.[133] Latin music\'s consumption in the United States increased 15% between the first half of 2016 and the first half of 2018.[134] The International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) reported that revenue in Latin America grew 17.7% in 2017 and described ""Despacito"" as a ""game-changing hit.""[120] In 2018, eight out of the 10 most-viewed YouTube music videos of the year were for songs performed in Spanish and the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation referred to it as ""the \'Despacito\' effect.""[135][136]\n\nSony/ATV Music Publishing President Jorge Mej\xc3\xada stated that the song marked a ""before and after"" in the global consumption of Latin music.[137] Before its success, Sony ""had a big Latin single roughly every two years,"" a situation that reverted into an ""avalanche of Latin songs around the world.""[137] Andrew Unterberger of Billboard stated that ""2017 was the year that Latin pop took over the United States"" due to the song and its quick impact on ""Mi Gente"", Camila Cabello\'s ""Havana"", and the chart performance of acts including Maluma, Ozuna and Bad Bunny, who achieved their biggest hits in the country.[138]\n\nIn July 2017, it was reported that tourist interest in Puerto Rico increased by 45% since the worldwide success of the song.[139][140] Tour operators cite the song\'s music video for increasing interest in locations such as Club La Factor\xc3\xada and La Perla district in Old San Juan, which were featured in the video.[141]\n\nMusic video [ edit ]\n\nBackground [ edit ]\n\n2006 Miss Universe Zuleyka Rivera co-starred in the music video.\n\nThe music video for ""Despacito"" was directed by Puerto Rican director Carlos P\xc3\xa9rez and produced by Joanna Egozcue and Roxy Qui\xc3\xb1ones.[142] Filming took place in December 2016 in La Perla neighborhood and the bar La Factor\xc3\xada in San Juan, Puerto Rico.[142] Carlos P\xc3\xa9rez had previously worked with Luis Fonsi on ""Coraz\xc3\xb3n en la Maleta"" (2014) and with Daddy Yankee on clips including ""Gasolina"" (2004), ""Rompe"" (2005), ""Descontrol"" (2010), and ""Ven Conmigo"" (2011), among others.[143] 2006 Miss Universe Zuleyka Rivera co-starred in the video and was contacted by Fonsi to represent ""the powerful Latina woman.""[30]\n\nJorge Mu\xc3\xb1\xc3\xadz Ort\xc3\xadz of EFE stated that the music video ""highlights some of the main cultural and folkloric symbols of Puerto Rico"" by showing its ""splendid beaches, the colorful landscape of La Perla, the rattle of the Puerto Rican cuatro and the barrels of the autochthonous genre of bomba, Zuleyka Rivera\'s hips movement and a pair of men enjoying a game of dominoes.""[144] On April 10, 2018, Luis Fonsi\'s YouTube Vevo account was hacked by an anonymous group, who removed the video from his channel for hours before becoming available again.[145]\n\nSynopsis [ edit ]\n\nThe video shows both artists performing the song while participating on different parties on the island, featuring model Zuleyka Rivera.[146] The clip starts with shots of La Perla\'s coast during daylight while showing Zuleyka Rivera arriving at the shanty town on foot. Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee perform the song in a street while elders are playing dominos, a child is getting his hair cut, two people are talking while listening to the radio, and couples are dancing in the background. The video intercalates with shots of Fonsi and Daddy Yankee singing in front of a car with people sitting on it and dancing next to it. As Daddy Yankee is finishing his verse, Zuleyka Rivera enters La Factor\xc3\xada bar while the artists are performing and dancing alongside other people, and men are playing bomba drums.[144] Fonsi proceeds to dance with Rivera as the song ends. The outro consists of Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee singing the hook a cappella with the people at the bar.[144]\n\nRelease and reception [ edit ]\n\n[147] Video views grew virally and peaked about 28 weeks after it was posted. [147] Cumulative video views exhibit a slower, though stable, growth rate after its first year.\n\nThe official music video on YouTube was released on Fonsi\'s channel on January 12, 2017 and amassed one billion views in 97 days, becoming the second-fastest video on the site to reach the milestone.[148][149][150] It also became the fastest video on YouTube to surpass two billion views, with 154 days.[151] The clip became the first on YouTube to receive three, four, five, and six billion views on August 4, 2017; October 11, 2017; April 5, 2018; and February 24, 2019, respectively (dates are based on UTC).[152][153][154][155] It has received over 7 billion views as of November 2, 2020 and was the most-viewed video on the site from August 4, 2017 until November 2, 2020, when Pinkfong\'s video for ""Baby Shark"" surpassed it.[148][156][157] It is also the site\'s most-liked video, with over 40 million likes as of August 9, 2020.[158] On Vevo, the music video received 5.14 million views in its first 24 hours of release, which the website reported as being the most for a Spanish-language video\'s first day on its platform.[64]\n\nThe music video received a Latin Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video at the 18th Latin Grammy Awards and a Billboard Music Award for Top Streaming Song (Video) at the 25th Billboard Music Awards, and was nominated for an American Music Award for Video of the Year at the 45th American Music Awards.[44][45][48]\n\nLive performances [ edit ]\n\nLuis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee performed ""Despacito"" live together for the first time at the 2017 Billboard Latin Music Awards on April 27, 2017 and later on The Voice season 12 finals on May 23, 2017.[159][160] The only live performance by Justin Bieber and Luis Fonsi was at the Jos\xc3\xa9 Miguel Agrelot Coliseum in Puerto Rico on April 18, 2017 during the former\'s Purpose World Tour.[161] Bieber was not able to sing the song during live performances and was caught replacing portions of the lyrics with the word ""blah"" and nonsensical ramblings during one performance in a much publicized incident.[162] Fonsi has defended him for not knowing the lyrics, saying that he has to be given ""a little bit of a pass"" because Spanish is not Bieber\'s main language.[163]\n\nLuis Fonsi performed ""Despacito"" on American talk show Conan on June 12, 2017 -his first late-night television appearance in the United States- and on The Ellen DeGeneres Show on September 14, 2017.[164][165] He also performed the song with random lyrics alongside American television host Jimmy Fallon on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon on January 30, 2019.[166]\n\nBoth Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee included the song on their setlists for the 2017\xe2\x80\x9318 Love + Dance World Tour and the 2017 Tamo En Vivo Europe Tour, respectively.[167][168][169] On November 16, 2017, Luis Fonsi sang ""Despacito"" featuring Puerto Rican singer Victor Manuelle, Colombian band Bomba Est\xc3\xa9reo and American disc jockey Diplo at the 18th Latin Grammy Awards.[170] On January 28, 2018, Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee performed the song at the 60th Grammy Awards on the Madison Square Garden, becoming the 12th and 13th Latin artists ever to perform at the Grammy Awards.[171][172]\n\nOther remixes and cover versions [ edit ]\n\nThe first two official remixes for ""Despacito"" were released on March 17, 2017: a solo pop version by Fonsi and a salsa version featuring vocals by Puerto Rican musician Victor Manuelle.[173] Two other remixes were released on May 5, 2017: an electronic dance version produced by American trio Major Lazer and Colombian DJ MOSKA and an urban version remixed by Colombian producer Sky.[174] A Portuguese-language version written by Erika Ender and performed by Luis Fonsi featuring Brazilian singer Israel Novaes was released on July 14, 2017.[175] A banda version by Luis Fonsi with Mexican group La Bandononona Clave Nueva De Max Peraza was released on September 1, 2017. A Spanish/Mandarin version by Luis Fonsi and Singaporean singer-songwriter JJ Lin was released on January 26, 2018.[176]\n\nThe song has been covered by a wide range of artists around the world, including Korean singer J.Fla,[177] a classical crossover by Croatian-based duo 2Cellos,[178] a metal version by Norwegian musician Leo Moracchioli, a piano version by Hungarian pianist and world record-holder Peter Bence,[179] an acoustic version by American band Boyce Avenue[180] and a Broadway-style cover by American musical collective group Postmodern Jukebox.[181] These covers garnered between seven and 47 million views on YouTube except for J.Fla\'s video, which has 172 million views. Leo Moracchioli\'s version peaked at number 35 on the Hungarian Single Top 40 chart on August 10, 2017.[182]\n\nPolitical uses [ edit ]\n\nThe song has been used, with altered lyrics, for political purposes. In Argentina, the melody was used by various politicians for their respective TV advertisements for the 2017 midterm elections, by scientists to protest against President Mauricio Macri and by feminists as an initiative to convoke people to a concentration about violence against women.[183][184][185] Venezuelan President Nicol\xc3\xa1s Maduro used it to call for voting in the controversial Constitutional Assembly election.[186] Luis Fonsi, Daddy Yankee and Erika Ender showed their displeasure with the unauthorized use of the song for political purposes in Venezuela, criticizing Maduro\'s government use of the song as propaganda.[187][188] On August 16, 2017, English television host James Corden remixed the song to comment on American President Donald Trump during his talk show The Late Late Show with James Corden.[189] On September 15, 2020, Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden played a few bars from the song at a campaign event headlined by Luis Fonsi. In response, Trump tweeted an edited video showing Biden instead playing N.W.A\'s ""Fuck tha Police"".[190]\n\nCredits and personnel [ edit ]\n\nOriginal version Credits adapted from Tidal and The Latin Recording Academy.[44][191] Erika Ender \xe2\x80\x93 songwriting\n\nLuis Fonsi \xe2\x80\x93 songwriting, vocals\n\nJaycen Joshua \xe2\x80\x93 mixing\n\nDave Kutch \xe2\x80\x93 mastering\n\nChristian Nieves \xe2\x80\x93 Puerto Rican cuatro\n\nMauricio Rengifo \xe2\x80\x93 producer, recording engineer\n\nJuan Rivera ""Gaby Music"" \xe2\x80\x93 recording engineer\n\nLuis Saldarriaga \xe2\x80\x93 recording engineer\n\nAndr\xc3\xa9s Torres \xe2\x80\x93 producer, recording engineer, acoustic guitar\n\nDaddy Yankee \xe2\x80\x93 songwriting, vocals Justin Bieber remix Credits adapted from Tidal and The Recording Academy.[192] Justin Bieber \xe2\x80\x93 songwriting, vocals\n\nJason Boyd \xe2\x80\x93 songwriting\n\nJosh Gudwin \xe2\x80\x93 producer, recording engineer, remixer, mixing\n\nMarty James \xe2\x80\x93 songwriting\n\nChris O\'Ryan \xe2\x80\x93 recording engineer\n\nJuan Felipe Samper \xe2\x80\x93 vocal coach\n\nCharts [ edit ]\n\nCertifications [ edit ]\n\nSee also [ edit ]\n\nNotes [ edit ]\n\na b [78][83][84][85] Nielsen SoundScan did not provide data from June 29, 2018 to January 3, 2019.

"b'The #MeToo reckoning is continuing to slowly engulf R. Kelly. In January, Lifetime premiered the documentary series Surviving R. Kelly, an overview of Kelly\xe2\x80\x99s life and career \xe2\x80\x94 and of the decades\xe2\x80\x99 worth of accounts that accuse him of having sexually abused young women and children. (Kelly\xe2\x80\x99s lawyer has said the series is full of lies and has threatened to sue.)\n\nIn February, Kelly was officially charged with 10 counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse against four victims, at least three of them minors. And in May, Kelly was charged with 11 more counts, including the far more serious charge of aggravated criminal sexual assault.\n\nNow, Kelly faces 18 new counts, including kidnapping and child pornography.\n\nKelly has been accused of sexual relationships with minors going back to 1994, when he married 15-year-old pop star Aaliyah. (The marriage was annulled.) In the 25 years since then, he has been sued multiple times for inappropriate sexual contact with a minor (he settled out of court every time), and he was eventually charged with creating child pornography. (A jury found him not guilty on the grounds that they could not conclusively identify the other figure in his infamous sex tape as a child.)\n\nIn 2017, he was accused of creating an abusive \xe2\x80\x9csex cult\xe2\x80\x9d of very young women, whom he allegedly isolates, brainwashes, and abuses physically and emotionally. Since the story broke, multiple women have added their own testimonies of abuse at R. Kelly\xe2\x80\x99s hands, including his ex-wife. (Through a lawyer, Kelly has denied all accusations, saying he would \xe2\x80\x9cwork diligently and forcibly to pursue his accusers and clear his name.\xe2\x80\x9d)\n\nYet despite decades of lawsuits and allegations, Kelly\xe2\x80\x99s career marched steadily on. In 2017, he finished an arena tour with a few cancellations. In 2018, he toured with singer Charlie Wilson (there were some protests). His music appeared in Pitch Perfect 3.\n\nAt Coachella in 2018, rapper Vince Staples repeatedly referred to Kelly as a \xe2\x80\x9cchild molester\xe2\x80\x9d in an interview with Complex. And in our post-#MeToo, post-Time\xe2\x80\x99s Up, post-Harvey Weinstein world, and given the sheer volume of allegations against Kelly, it seems reasonable to raise the question of why he\xe2\x80\x99s been able to continue working so much. But Staples\xe2\x80\x99s interviewer only giggled nervously and protested, \xe2\x80\x9cWe can\xe2\x80\x99t ever talk about this guy. ... You\xe2\x80\x99re about to get me fired from Coachella. It\xe2\x80\x99s my first time here.\xe2\x80\x9d Later, Staples tweeted that \xe2\x80\x9cR. Kelly people is looking for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nladies and gentlemen, vince staples on r kelly pic.twitter.com/SmZdYu9PNJ \xe2\x80\x94 andy (@aboynamedandy) April 16, 2018\n\nThat stasis appears to be changing. Most of the claims against Kelly were reiterated in a 2018 BBC Three documentary, R Kelly: Sex, Girls & Videotapes, and then again in Lifetime\xe2\x80\x99s Surviving R. Kelly. And over the past two years, at least five members of Kelly\xe2\x80\x99s inner circle have left him. His assistant, his accountant, his lawyer, and his rep have all said that they no longer work for him, although none of them have gone into detail about their departures and all have been supportive and complimentary toward Kelly in their statements. His longtime musical accompanist, DJ Phantom, was less circumspect about his decision to leave Kelly in 2017: \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t know then what I know now,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a shitbag.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLast spring, the Women of Color committee within Time\xe2\x80\x99s Up threw its weight behind the #MuteRKelly campaign, calling for anyone currently profiting from Kelly and his music to drop him, including Spotify, Ticketmaster, and Kelly\xe2\x80\x99s record label, RCA. In January, RCA quietly dropped Kelly.\n\nAnd now, Kelly has been officially charged with more than a dozen counts of sexual abuse and assault.\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s possible that these latest developments mean that he\xe2\x80\x99s about to face lasting consequences for those accusations. But if that\xe2\x80\x99s the case, those consequences took more than two decades to reach him.\n\nAnd despite everything, it\xe2\x80\x99s still possible that Kelly will continue on with his life and his career as usual. According to the Blast, Kelly\xe2\x80\x99s music saw a 16 percent surge in Spotify streams after Surviving R. Kelly premiered.\n\nThere is a persistent vagueness to the way we talk about R. Kelly that makes it possible to forget exactly what he\xe2\x80\x99s been accused of, how often he\xe2\x80\x99s been accused, and how much evidence there is against him. And most likely, that\xe2\x80\x99s because his accusers are overwhelmingly young black women and hence apparently easy for America to ignore.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe saddest fact I\xe2\x80\x99ve learned is: Nobody matters less to our society than young black women,\xe2\x80\x9d says Jim DeRogatis, the reporter who broke the R. Kelly story. \xe2\x80\x9cNobody.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTo try to combat that vagueness and the erasure that it makes possible, here is a timeline of all the accusations of sexual misconduct against R. Kelly.\n\nMuch of the chronology below is drawn from DeRogatis\xe2\x80\x99s invaluable reporting on the R. Kelly accusations, including his own immensely thorough timeline. DeRogatis\xe2\x80\x99s timeline covers the entire span of Kelly\xe2\x80\x99s life, including his major career milestones and unrelated legal issues, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve narrowed the focus of this timeline to specifically cover the sexual misconduct accusations against Kelly.\n\nOver the 25-year span of this timeline, a consistent pattern emerges. Over and over again, Kelly is accused of the same behavior: of targeting girls and very young women, isolating them, and controlling and abusing them. And after the dust from the accusation settles, Kelly goes on living his life with very few changes.\n\nHere, from Aaliyah to the alleged sex cult to the charges of aggravated criminal sexual abuse, are all the R. Kelly accusations.\n\nAugust 30, 1994: 27-year-old R. Kelly marries 15-year-old Aaliyah\n\nThe \xe2\x80\x9990s music sensation Aaliyah was Kelly\xe2\x80\x99s prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9. They met when she was 12 years old, and Kelly wrote and produced her first album in 1993. It was titled Age Ain\xe2\x80\x99t Nothing but a Number. In 1995, Vibe magazine published a copy of their marriage license, with 15-year-old Aaliyah falsely listing her age as 18.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFamily members say Aaliyah thought it was all an elaborate \xe2\x80\x98game,\xe2\x80\x99 and she just went along with it,\xe2\x80\x9d the Chicago Sun-Times later reported, adding that the marriage license was reportedly obtained by Kelly\xe2\x80\x99s assistant, using a fake ID. \xe2\x80\x9cWithin hours, she realized what had happened, and she went to her family and sought their help.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe marriage was annulled in 1994, just months after the ceremony. In the settlement, according to documents obtained by the Sun-Times, Aaliyah promises not to pursue further legal action because of \xe2\x80\x9cemotional distress caused by any aspect of her business or personal relationship with Robert\xe2\x80\x9d or for \xe2\x80\x9cphysical injury or emotional pain and suffering arising from any assault or battery perpetrated by Robert against her person.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n1995: Kelly reportedly begins a relationship with underage Lizzette Martinez\n\nIn an interview with BuzzFeed published in May 2018, Martinez says she met Kelly at the mall when she was 17, and that he initiated a sexual relationship with her while aware of her age. She also says that he was physically abusive to her and that he pressured her to perform some sexual acts against her will. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was very controlled: what I wore, how I spoke, who my friends were, who I could bring around,\xe2\x80\x9d she says. Kelly has not yet commented on Martinez\xe2\x80\x99s story.\n\nDecember 24, 1996: the first of the known lawsuits accusing Kelly of sex with underage girls is filed\n\nTiffany Hawkins filed suit against Kelly and his record, publishing, and management companies on Christmas Eve 1996. The suit alleged that he initiated a sexual relationship with her when she was when he was 24 and she was 15, and that he pushed her to participate in group sex with him and other underage girls. Kelly allegedly met Hawkins at his old Chicago high school, Kenwood Academy, when he visited the school to reminisce about having gotten his start there and to inspire current students to follow their dreams.\n\nHawkins sought $10 million in damages, but Kelly countersued, claiming that Hawkins was attempting to blackmail him with a false paternity claim. (There is no paternity claim in Hawkins\xe2\x80\x99s lawsuit.) Hawkins settled for $250,000, and her suit went largely unnoticed until 2000, when DeRogatis began to investigate the R. Kelly case for the Chicago Sun-Times.\n\nDecember 21, 2000: the Chicago Sun-Times publishes the first newspaper article investigating Kelly\xe2\x80\x99s alleged sex crimes\n\nIn a lengthy and thoroughly reported story, the Chicago Sun-Times outlined the facts of the Tiffany Hawkins lawsuit and Kelly\xe2\x80\x99s marriage to Aaliyah. \xe2\x80\x9cChicago police twice have investigated allegations that Kelly was having sex with an underage female but dropped the investigations because the girl would not cooperate,\xe2\x80\x9d the story noted. No one from Kelly\xe2\x80\x99s camp provided comment for the article.\n\nJanuary 2001: the first R. Kelly sex tape emerges\n\nAn anonymous source sent a videotape of what appeared to be Kelly having sex with a very young woman to Jim DeRogatis at the Sun-Times. DeRogatis handed the tape over to the Chicago police, but the police, unable to identify the woman in the tape, did not charge Kelly. Bootleg copies of the tape circulated throughout Chicago. As far as we can tell, Kelly has not publicly commented on this tape.\n\nAugust 2001: the second R. Kelly lawsuit is filed\n\nTracy Sampson, a former intern at Epic Records, filed a lawsuit against Kelly claiming that he initiated a sexual relationship with her when she was 17. DeRogatis quotes at length from her lawsuit:\n\nI was lied to by him. \xe2\x80\xa6 I was coerced into receiving oral sex from a girl I did not want to have sex with. I was often treated as his personal sex object and cast aside. He would tell me to come to his studio and have sex with him, then tell me to go. He often tried to control every aspect of my life including who I would see and where I would go.\n\nThe suit was settled out of court. The size of the settlement is unknown. Kelly denied all wrongdoing.\n\nFebruary 8, 2002: the second R. Kelly tape emerges\n\nAn anonymous source sent another videotape to the Chicago Police Department, this one showing Kelly engaging in sex acts with and urinating on what appears to be a young girl while instructing her to call him \xe2\x80\x9cDaddy.\xe2\x80\x9d A witness identified the girl and said she would have been 14 at the time the videotape was made.\n\nKelly, who was scheduled to perform at the Winter Olympics the same month that the tape emerged, denied in a radio interview that the tape showed him having sex with a minor. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s crap, and that\xe2\x80\x99s how we\xe2\x80\x99re going to treat it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe reason these things are happening I really do believe is because of the fact that I didn\xe2\x80\x99t fall back as far as blackmail was concerned. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t give them any money.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBootleg copies of the tape circulated across the country, and police eventually indicted Kelly on 21 counts of child pornography.\n\nApril 29, 2002: Kelly is sued by a third woman \xe2\x80\xa6\n\nPatrice Jones said in her lawsuit that Kelly had sex with her when she was 16 years old, and that when she became pregnant, he coerced her into having an abortion. Kelly settled the lawsuit out of court for an unknown sum. His lawyer described the suit as \xe2\x80\x9ca collection of half-truths, distortions and outright lies.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMay 4, 2002: \xe2\x80\xa6 and a fourth\n\nThirty-three-year-old Montina Woods said that Kelly taped their sexual encounter without her knowledge and then distributed the tapes. Kelly, once again, settled out of court for an unknown sum. A spokesperson from his camp described the suit as \xe2\x80\x9cridiculous\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cnonsensical.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n2005: Kelly\xe2\x80\x99s second wife, Andrea Lee, files a restraining order against him alleging abuse\n\nKelly married dancer Drea Kelly, n\xc3\xa9e Andrea Lee, in 1996. In 2005, she petitioned for and received an emergency restraining order against him, citing physical abuse, harassment, stalking, and interfering with her personal liberty.\n\nIn her petition, Drea wrote that when she asked for a divorce, Kelly pinned her down and hit her repeatedly, yelling, \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you leave me! Why are you leaving me?\xe2\x80\x9d She added that he repeatedly \xe2\x80\x9csnapped\xe2\x80\x9d at her when she was near a man, including the time a man showed up in the background of a picture she took with her kids.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy wife and I had a heated argument, and we are now in the process of working it out,\xe2\x80\x9d Kelly said in a public statement. \xe2\x80\x9cWe hope that the press and public will give us the time and privacy we need to resolve this very personal situation.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nOnce the emergency order expired, Drea asked for it to be dismissed, and she refused to comment on the incident in the press, referring to it only as \xe2\x80\x9cold news.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nOctober 4, 2006: Kelly is sued by his mentor and associate\n\nLongtime Kelly associate Henry \xe2\x80\x9cLove\xe2\x80\x9d Vaughn said in a lawsuit that Kelly attacked him at a party at his house, and backed out of paying Vaughan for his work on a song as well. In an interview with the Sun-Times, Vaughn claimed Kelly attacked him after he remarked that Kelly\xe2\x80\x99s 7-year-old daughter was dancing \xe2\x80\x9cgrown-up style,\xe2\x80\x9d saying, \xe2\x80\x9cShe was all dressed up with tight jeans and makeup on, a seven-year-old girl, dancing on top of the pool table. It was ridiculous. She told my lady, \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m having a show next week; when you come, bring $100.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nKelly\xe2\x80\x99s lawyer once again described the lawsuit as \xe2\x80\x9ca pathetic collection of half-truths, distortions and outright lies.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMay 2008: the trial of R. Kelly\n\nMore than five years after the news of the alleged child sex tape broke, Kelly faced trial on 14 counts of child pornography. (In the years since he was indicted, Kelly\xe2\x80\x99s lawyers had successfully knocked out seven of the original charges.) The trial lasted for just over a month, and neither Kelly nor the girl on the tape testified. Although 15 witnesses for the prosecution took the stand to identify the girl in question, the jury concluded that they could not be positive of the girl\xe2\x80\x99s identity and thus could not be sure that she was underage. After one day of deliberations, the jury found Kelly not guilty. Kelly broke down in tears in the courtroom.\n\nAfter the trial, Kelly spent nearly 10 years tending to his career, headlining musical festivals and staying away from scandal. And then \xe2\x80\xa6\n\nJuly 2017: news of the alleged sex cult breaks\n\nLast summer, BuzzFeed News reported that R. Kelly was allegedly holding multiple young women in compounds on his properties across the country, controlling their every move. According to BuzzFeed\xe2\x80\x99s sources, the women were required to call Kelly \xe2\x80\x9cDaddy\xe2\x80\x9d; ask his permission before going anywhere, including the bathroom; wear jogging suits so that other men could not see their bodies; and turn and face the wall when other men entered the room. BuzzFeed further reported that Kelly allegedly coerced the women into group sex, videotaped them, and beat them when they disobeyed him.\n\nBut the women currently living with Kelly have repeatedly said that they are happy and that they are with him of their own free will. And because they are all 18 or older, police have not intervened.\n\nThrough a lawyer, Kelly issued a statement denying the BuzzFeed report. \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Robert Kelly is both alarmed and disturbed at the recent revelations attributed to him,\xe2\x80\x9d the statement reads. \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Kelly unequivocally denies such allegations and will work diligently and forcibly to pursue his accusers and clear his name.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAugust 2017: one of R. Kelly\xe2\x80\x99s accusers breaks her nondisclosure agreement to speak out\n\nJerhonda Pace says she began a relationship with Kelly in 2009, when she was 16, and that the details of their relationship match the details reported about Kelly\xe2\x80\x99s alleged \xe2\x80\x9csex cult\xe2\x80\x9d: At first Kelly courted her, she said, and then he isolated her, and then he began to abuse her. After their relationship ended, she sued Kelly for damages, and says he settled with her out of court in exchange for her signing an NDA. Pace said she decided to break the terms of her settlement last summer in order to help the women still with Kelly. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I can speak out and I can help them get out of that situation, that\xe2\x80\x99s what I will do,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\n\nA representative for Kelly denied the accusations, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cThe allegations against Mr. Kelly are false, and are being made by individuals known to be dishonest. It is clear these continuing stories are the result of the effort of those with personal agendas who are working in concert to interfere with and damage his career. Mr. Kelly again denies any and all wrongdoing and is taking appropriate legal action to protect himself from ongoing defamation.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nOctober 2017: another Kelly accuser backs up the sex cult story\n\nKitti Jones says her relationship with Kelly also mirrors the accounts of the sex cult story. Kelly got her to quit her job and move in with him, Jones said last October, and then he began to control her, and then he began to abuse her. Kelly denied all the accusations.\n\nApril 9, 2018: an unnamed woman files a criminal complaint against Kelly\n\nAn unnamed woman says she spent eight months in a relationship with Kelly when she was 19, and that he was grooming her to join his sex cult, the Huffington Post reports. According to the woman\xe2\x80\x99s lawyer, at one point Kelly told her that \xe2\x80\x9cshe would have to sign a contract and offer collateral information about herself and her family for Kelly\xe2\x80\x99s protection.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe woman says Kelly intentionally infected her with an STD over the course of their relationship. She\xe2\x80\x99s filed a criminal complaint against him, citing charges of \xe2\x80\x9cunlawful restraint, furnishing alcohol and illegal drugs to a minor, and aggravated assault (via the referenced intentional STD infection).\xe2\x80\x9d Her lawyer says she is preparing a federal civil lawsuit against Kelly. Kelly has denied the accusations.\n\nNovember 20, 2018: Kelly\xe2\x80\x99s ex-wife Drea Kelly accuses R. Kelly of domestic violence\n\nKelly and his second wife Drea Kelly (n\xc3\xa9e Andrea Lee) divorced in 2009, but rumors have long flourished that dark secrets lurked in their marriage.\n\nIn 2003, Drea\xe2\x80\x99s mother Gerri Cruz told journalists that she feared that R. Kelly was brainwashing her daughter. \xe2\x80\x9cThe last time I talked to her was over two years ago on the phone,\xe2\x80\x9d Cruz said. \xe2\x80\x9cShe was crying hysterically and violently.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nCruz said she asked the police to check out Kelly\xe2\x80\x99s house to make sure that Drea was all right, but nothing came of it.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know if my child is under the influence. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if she is being controlled. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if people are watching her. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if she is being brainwashed,\xe2\x80\x9d Cruz said.\n\nDrea denied that she was being kept away from her family. \xe2\x80\x9cWe live right here in Chicago. How could you not know where I am? It\xe2\x80\x99s not as if I am overseas,\xe2\x80\x9d she said in an interview with Essence in 2009.\n\nEarlier reports in the Chicago Sun-Times said that Kelly\xe2\x80\x99s associates referred to Drea as \xe2\x80\x9cPuppydog,\xe2\x80\x9d and that she was \xe2\x80\x9crequired\xe2\x80\x9d to knock before entering a room in the couple\xe2\x80\x99s shared house.\n\nIn November 2018, Drea spoke out publicly for the first time about the abuse she says she has experienced at Kelly\xe2\x80\x99s hands. She told ABC News that Kelly emotionally, physically, and sexually abused her, and that when they were married, she thought he might kill her. She says she decided to come forward after stories of Kelly\xe2\x80\x99s alleged sex cult began to emerge.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll these allegations start comin\xe2\x80\x99 out again and I\xe2\x80\x99m like, \xe2\x80\x98God, OK. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I can take this one,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\n\nKelly\xe2\x80\x99s representatives declined to comment on Drea\xe2\x80\x99s statements.\n\nJanuary 3, 2019: Surviving R. Kelly premieres on Lifetime\n\nLifetime\xe2\x80\x99s Surviving R. Kelly consists of three two-hour installments. The first is focused on Kelly\xe2\x80\x99s childhood and early music career \xe2\x80\x94 and the sexual abuse he suffered. The second is focused on his 2008 criminal trial. The third is focused on the 2017 \xe2\x80\x9csex cult\xe2\x80\x9d story. While the series mostly reiterates information that was already on the record, it does include accounts from multiple members of Kelly\xe2\x80\x99s inner circle who are speaking out in public for the first time, and its arrival was marked by outrage.\n\nIn December 2018, a private screening of the docuseries was evacuated and then canceled following a gun threat. \xe2\x80\x9cThe first thing that came to my mind \xe2\x80\x94 and I can\xe2\x80\x99t speak for anyone else \xe2\x80\x94 was that [R. Kelly] had this shut down,\xe2\x80\x9d Drea Kelly told Rolling Stone after the evacuation. \xe2\x80\x9cI believe it was somebody connected to him.\xe2\x80\x9d And on the day of the premiere, TMZ published a letter from Kelly\xe2\x80\x99s lawyer threatening to sue Lifetime over the series.\n\nFebruary 14, 2019: a third sex tape emerges\n\nBoth the New Yorker and CNN reported that law enforcement officials in Illinois had received a copy of a tape that appeared to show Kelly engaging in sex acts with a 14-year-old girl.\n\nFebruary 22, 2019: Kelly is charged with 10 counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse\n\nProsecutors in Cook County, Illinois filed 10 counts of aggravated sexual abuse against Kelly. He was arraigned in March.\n\nMay 30, 2019: Kelly is charged with 11 additional counts, including aggravated criminal sexual assault\n\nThree months after filing 10 charges against Kelly, Cook County, Illinois filed an additional 11 charges against him. The new charges include aggravated criminal sexual assault, which is considered more serious than the sexual abuse with which Kelly was previously charged and which can be punished by up to 30 years in prison.\n\nJuly 11 \xe2\x80\x93 12, 2019: Kelly faces 18 new counts, including kidnapping and child pornography\n\nCook County, Illinois filed an additional 13 charges against Kelly on July 11, including charges of child pornography. The following day, he received five additional federal sex crime charges, including charges of kidnapping and forced labor in New York.\n\nThe sheer volume of accusations Kelly has fielded since 1994 is astonishing, and perhaps it offers its own answer as to why he\xe2\x80\x99s been able to live his life with few consequences. In a sense, his fans have been inoculated. They\xe2\x80\x99ve been listening to accusations against Kelly for 25 years, and they\xe2\x80\x99ve been listening to Kelly maintain his innocence for just as long. In 2019, ignoring the persistent allegations against Kelly is just part of being an R. Kelly fan.\n\nThis article was originally published in April 2018. Vox has continued to update it as more information comes to light.'"

Despite some hoping they\xe2\x80\x99d work it out, the two filed for divorce in April 2017. Supposedly, Ben wasn\xe2\x80\x99t ready to let go, as Us Weekly reports that since they filed the papers, \xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x99s begged her to come back several times, but she has no interest.\xe2\x80\x9d Though Ben has moved on to date Saturday Night Live producer Lindsay Shookus, 37, he was reportedly, at one point, telling friends he wanted his ex back.\n\nDespite two years of trying to fix things \xe2\x80\x93 Jennifer \xe2\x80\x9cput her heart and soul into fixing the relationship and so desperately wanted to turn things around for the children\xe2\x80\x99s sake, as well as theirs,\xe2\x80\x9d a fiend told Us \xe2\x80\x93 it was all in vain.

"b'Howie Mandel has worked with Meghan Markle in the past, but he is not expecting an invitation to the royal wedding.\n\nMarkle appeared on Mandel\'s TV show ""Deal or No Deal"" from 2006 to 2007. The National Enquirer reported that Mandel wants to receive an invite to the ""Suits"" star\'s wedding.\n\n""It would be nice if Meghan invited him,"" an unnamed source said. ""Howie gave her career a big boost, and he\'s very proud of all the young ladies from the show. He\'s been reminding everyone who will listen that he found her first.""\n\nGossip Cop debunked the previous report. The publication reached out to Mandel\'s rep who denied the rumors. The ""America\'s Got Talent"" judge\'s rep said that the report claiming that Mandel wants an invitation to the royal wedding is ""made-up.""\n\nThe publication added that there are a lot of popular celebrities that also appeared in ""Deal or No Deal,"" including Chrissy Teigen. Mandel never clamored for an invitation to her wedding with John Legend. Also, the show aired for four years and it involved dozens of briefcase girls. Thus, it is unlikely for Mandel to expect invites from all of the ladies\' weddings.\n\nIn related news, Markle\'s ""Deal or No Deal"" photos has resurfaced online. Earlier this month, a snap of Markle wearing a sexy Santa outfit made headlines. In the snap are Markle, Mandel and her fellow case models.\n\nThe photo was taken during the 35th episode of ""Deal or No Deal"" Season 2. It aired on Christmas Day in 2006.\n\nMarkle confessed that her appearance in the show was ""to make ends meet."" She was still an auditioning actress at that time and was still waiting for a big break.\n\n""I would put that in the category of things I was doing while I was auditioning to try to make ends meet,"" Markle said. ""I would end up standing up there forever in these terribly uncomfortable and inexpensive five-inch heels just waiting for someone to pick my number so I could go and sit down.""\n\nWhile Mandel\'s invite remains unconfirmed, Markle\'s parents are expected to be part of her royal wedding. The ""Remember Me"" star reportedly wanted to get her dad, Tom Markle, and mom, Doria Radlan, to be involved in her big day. In fact, Markle wanted to stick with traditions and have her dad walk her down the aisle.'"

"b'Things aren\xe2\x80\x99t looking good for Kody Brown! When Season 11 of his reality show Sister Wives debuted in late 2016, \xe2\x80\x9cTLC was less than impressed by the ratings,\xe2\x80\x9d an insider revealed, explaining that premiere viewership of 1.8 million \xe2\x80\x9cwas not enough\xe2\x80\x9d for the network. \xe2\x80\x9cSo Kody told them he\xe2\x80\x99d be willing to have the network slash his family\xe2\x80\x99s pay from $180,000 for each adult to $180,000 total if it meant they could make Season 12. He put everything on the line to convince them it could still work.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut, he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t deliver and now his wives are turning on him. They\xe2\x80\x99ve been struggling for the past few years, and Kody\xe2\x80\x99s three \xe2\x80\x9cspiritual marriages\xe2\x80\x9d have all fizzled out. \xe2\x80\x9cHis only real connection seems to be with [legal wife] Robyn now,\xe2\x80\x9d an insider revealed to Life & Style. \xe2\x80\x9cThe other wives have all but given up on him. They mostly see him as an ex-husband who turns up to help with the children.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut, Kody doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to accept that it\xe2\x80\x99s all coming to an end. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s been blaming everyone for the current state of the show \xe2\x80\x94 except himself,\xe2\x80\x9d the insider admitted. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s too proud for that.\xe2\x80\x9d When the show began in 2010, viewers were fascinated to see a seemingly happy polygamous family on TV. But those days are over. \xe2\x80\x9cTLC has discovered you can only pretend things are all rosy for so long. Fans now realize the Browns are anything but a happy group.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMeri has pulled away completely. She first shattered the illusion that all was well when she had an emotional online and phone affair in 2015 with a man, Sam Cooper, who turned out to be a female catfisher. \xe2\x80\x9cKody has never forgiven Meri for it,\xe2\x80\x9d the insider said. She moved out of their Las Vegas culdesac months ago after purchasing a Utah bed-and-breakfast in late 2017 and rarely returns to Vegas except for family events or when TLC needs to film something with her there. \xe2\x80\x9cKody\xe2\x80\x99s happy with that arrangement. He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to have too much to do with her. Their relationship is dead.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n(Photo Credit: Getty Iamges)\n\nHe doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want his reality-TV career to die too, but it\xe2\x80\x99s out of his hands. TLC is planning to create a series focusing on the children of sister wives, the insider says, which will feature Meri and Kody\xe2\x80\x99s daughter, Mariah, who came out as a lesbian last year. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s a favorite with fans because of her maturity,\xe2\x80\x9d the insider added. \xe2\x80\x9cBut while Meri will make the occasional appearance on the show, there are no plans to feature Kody.

Angie figures they need to learn how to spend time together for the sake of the kids,"" the source continued.\n\nBut is Pitt up for it? Apparently not. The informant shares that Pitt hasn\'t given her a concrete answer because he is not in a state of mind to spend time with Jolie yet.\n\n""Brad isn\'t having it and has not given her a clear answer. He has been busy working a lot and is leaning towards not participating in the trick-or-treating with the kids and his ex.

So it is understandable that he wouldn\'t want to lose his cool and hence, he is avoiding any kind of interaction with his estrange wife.'"

It\xe2\x80\x99s been nearly five years since he and Rihanna, 30, last broke up, but it always seems like he\xe2\x80\x99s doing something to stir up rumors and get people talking about him and her. Take, for instance, how he sent her a birthday greeting for her big 3-0.

In many ways Rihanna doesn\xe2\x80\x99t even recognize the girl that she was back then. It seems like a lifetime ago and so much has passed since then.\xe2\x80\x9d Indeed. Rihanna \xe2\x80\x93 who was already a big star by the time she and Chris called it quits for a second time in 2013 \xe2\x80\x93 continues to reach new levels of professional success. On top of that, she\xe2\x80\x99s found new love with billionaire boyfriend Hassan Jameel. Things are so good between them that she\xe2\x80\x99s even considering what he would be like as a father.\n\nAs for Breezy? \xe2\x80\x9cRihanna doesn\xe2\x80\x99t wish Chris any ill will\xe2\x80\x93the exact opposite in fact, she would love to see him happy and successful\xe2\x80\x94but, she really wants that chapter in her life to be closed for once and for all,\xe2\x80\x9d the source adds, and for everyone to just move on.\xe2\x80\x9d Someone should let Chris know, because he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem ready to let go of RiRi. He was one of the first people \xe2\x80\x93 literally, like he waited until it was midnight \xe2\x80\x93 to wish her Happy Birthday by posting a baby picture of her on his Instagram. Keeping pictures of your ex is one thing. Keeping pictures of your ex they were a toddler? Weird.\n\nChris also got people buzzing with a Feb. 9 tweet where he proposed \xe2\x80\x9cA CRAZY WORLD TOUR\xe2\x80\x9d that would include Beyonce, Bruno Mars himself and \xe2\x80\x93 you guessed it \xe2\x80\x93 Rihanna. The tweet came exactly 9 years after he infamously attacked Rihanna. So, many were highly suspicious of this \xe2\x80\x9ccoincidence.\xe2\x80\x9d Perhaps Chris should stay in his own lane for a while? Rihanna is clearly ready to stay in hers.\n\nHollywoodLifers, do you think Chris will ever stop talking about Rihanna?'"

"b'Meghan Markle is the most relatable royal we\xe2\x80\x99ve had in the U.S., well, ever. While we can\xe2\x80\x99t all be household names, actresses, and committed philanthropists, Markle still has a down-to-earth side that makes her marriage to Prince Harry feel just a bit like a fairytale.\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s safe to assume that everyone, royalty or not, has a bucket list (we\xe2\x80\x99d kill to see Queen Elizabeth II\xe2\x80\x99s) and Markle is no different. We\xe2\x80\x99ve found a few of Markle\xe2\x80\x99s future plans from her now-extinct blog\xe2\x80\x99s archives, as well as one bucket list item she\xe2\x80\x99s admitted to which has us eager for what\xe2\x80\x99s to come from Markle and Prince Harry (page 5).\n\nHer old blog gave us some insight\n\nUnbeknownst to many, Markle used to run the now-defunct lifestyle blog The Tig. Markle dedicated the blog to travel and food content and referred to it as a \xe2\x80\x9chub for all things I find exciting.\xe2\x80\x9d While The Tig is no more, a few blog posts still exist and offer an exclusive look into Markle\xe2\x80\x99s personality, her ambitions, and what she wants to accomplish in the future (page 4).\n\nShe turned her New Year\xe2\x80\x99s resolutions into a lifestyle\n\nWhile we didn\xe2\x80\x99t gain access to Markle\xe2\x80\x99s 2018 New Year\xe2\x80\x99s resolutions, she wrote a blog post in 2016 about resolutions which shared some valuable intel on the future royal. You can apply them any year, at any time, as Markle intended. The resolutions she listed (we\xe2\x80\x99ll go over those next) coincide with her future goals as a member of the royal family.\n\nMarkle\xe2\x80\x99s bucket list, of sorts, is relatable and, unsurprisingly, as down-to-earth as the former actress and philanthropist appears. The following former resolutions and future hopes are unlike any another future royal family member has publicly made and may surprise you.\n\nShe\xe2\x80\x99s working on her language\n\nWhile Markle made it a goal to need the disclaimer \xe2\x80\x98Pardon my French\xe2\x80\x99 less frequently, she also wanted to become fluent in the language. \xe2\x80\x9cRun a marathon. Stop biting my nails. Stop swearing. Re-learn French,\xe2\x80\x9d Markle wrote, claiming that these resolutions made her list every single year.\n\nThe blog post marks the year she resolved to not have a resolution, reminding herself and readers that if it takes a couple years (rather than just one) to become fluent in French or stop swearing \xe2\x80\x94 that\xe2\x80\x99s OK. \xe2\x80\x9cI often find myself wallowing in disappointment when I set a goal I can\xe2\x80\x99t achieve \xe2\x80\xa6 And at 34 years old, I\xe2\x80\x99m over that.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHer conclusion? Leave room for the magic\n\nThe year of the post in question \xe2\x80\x94 2016 \xe2\x80\x94 also marks the year that Markle began dating Prince Harry. So, it\xe2\x80\x99s only appropriate that the only thing she aimed to do in the new year was \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\xa6 to approach life playfully. To laugh and enjoy, to keep my standards high but my level of self-acceptance higher.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMarkle also took the advice of her Suits castmate and friend, Gina Torres, who told her, \xe2\x80\x9cMeg \xe2\x80\xa6 Make sure you leave room for magic.\xe2\x80\x9d Markle took it upon herself to follow this advice, encouraging herself and those reading to set goals while remaining open to change and, of course, magic.\n\nShe wants kids\n\nIn 2016, Best Health Canada interviewed Markle about a few of her bucket list items for the future. While she listed growing The Tig and continuing acting (both of which Markle has ceased, at least for now, as she embarks on her royal journey), the one item that caught our eye wasn\xe2\x80\x99t career-oriented. \xe2\x80\x9cOther bucket list items: I want to travel more and I can\xe2\x80\x99t wait to start a family, but in due time,\xe2\x80\x9d Markle said.\n\nHarry seemed to be in agreement while talking to BBC\xe2\x80\x99s Mishal Husain in the couple\xe2\x80\x99s first joint interview. \xe2\x80\x9cNot yet no,\xe2\x80\x9d he said about having children, \xe2\x80\x9cBut I think eventually, one step at a time, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll start a family in the near future.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShe has checked off meeting the royal family\n\nAnd with flying colors at that. Markle, who had met Queen Elizabeth II \xe2\x80\x9ca couple of times\xe2\x80\x9d prior to the engagement, found the Queen to be \xe2\x80\x9can incredible woman.\xe2\x80\x9d Markle also became the first royal fiancee to spend the holiday with the queen before marrying into the royal family.\n\nBoth Markle and Prince Harry have made clear how important family is to them. \xe2\x80\x9cHis family has been so welcoming,\xe2\x80\x9d Markle said of the royal family, \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\xa6 it\xe2\x80\x99s been really important to me too \xe2\x80\xa6 The family has been great and in the past year and a half, they\xe2\x80\x99ve made me feel a part of, not just the institution, but of a part of the family [sic].\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAs well as living out her dreams\n\nMarkle announced her departure from Suits along with her engagement to Prince Harry and plans to focus on her philanthropic efforts in the future. In their first joint interview, Markle discussed her \xe2\x80\x9ctransition\xe2\x80\x9d out of her career as \xe2\x80\x9cexciting,\xe2\x80\x9d noting that she plans to focus more energy on the causes that have been important to her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou realize that as you have access or a voice that people are willing to listen to, [it comes with] a lot of responsibility, which I take seriously,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. Markle has prepared for her new chapter and is excited to work \xe2\x80\x9cas a team\xe2\x80\x9d with her husband\xe2\x80\xa6 something the rest of the U.S. and the U.K. alike are excited to see pan out.\n\nFollow The Cheat Sheet on Facebook!'"

Dubbed \xe2\x80\x9cthrone idle\xe2\x80\x9d in the British press after skipping a Commonwealth Day service earlier this week in order to go skiing with friends, the 34-year-old royal is also understood to be in the dog house with his wife.\n\nKate is said by Royal Watch sources to be understandably \xe2\x80\x9cless than pleased\xe2\x80\x9d that her husband has been filmed partying with his friends and an unidentified woman. The new footage, which emerged Wednesday in several tabloids, shows Prince William singing and dancing with friends during a boys-only skiing trip. Shot at the popular Farinet nightclub in Verbier, the video also shows the prince putting his hand on the waist of a mystery woman\n\nWilliam was also filmed \xe2\x80\x9cdad dancing\xe2\x80\x9d at the club and enjoying himself on the slopes just hours before senior royals including the Queen, Prince Charles and Prince Harry attended Westminster Abbey for a Commonwealth Day service. The Queen considers the date one of the most important in the royal calendar and William\xe2\x80\x99s decision not to attend was seen as significant and controversial. While the Duchess of Cambridge stayed at home with Prince George and Princess Charlotte, William, who is now back in the U.K, chose to have fun on the slopes instead of attending the service.\n\nVIDEO: 12 Facts About Kate Middleton\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was William\xe2\x80\x99s choice to go away, but make no mistake Kate wears the trousers in their marriage, and she won\xe2\x80\x99t be happy with William\xe2\x80\x99s antics. She thought his partying days and larking around with the boys was a thing of the past. I imagine she\xe2\x80\x99ll find this humiliating and William will have come in for a pasting,\xe2\x80\x9d says a source.\n\nThe couple will put on a united front when they travel to Paris for a state visit on Friday, but the ski trip has once again put the spotlight on William who has so far carried out just 13 days of royal engagements this year. The Queen, who has been in poor health, has clocked up 24 days of official duties.\n\nLast February, the Cambridges posed on the slopes of Courchevel where they enjoyed their first family ski holiday with George and Charlotte. This year, in contrast, William opted to hit the slopes solo with a group of male friends who included Guy Pelly, James Meade, and Tom Van Straubenzee.\n\nAccording to The Sun newspaper, Wills and his pals spent Sunday night dancing to the band Hussy and looked \xe2\x80\x9cvery worse for wear\xe2\x80\x9d after downing \xe2\x80\x9cseveral drinks.\xe2\x80\x9d William, who is stepping down from his job as an air-ambulance pilot later this year, does have a history for having fun when he\xe2\x80\x99s out with the boys. At Tom van Straubenzee\xe2\x80\x99s wedding four years ago\xe2\x80\x94which Kate had to miss because she was pregnant with Prince George\xe2\x80\x94William reportedly ended up losing part of his front tooth after he was knocked in the face accidentally by his friend Tom Inskip during a marathon drinking session.\n\nAccording to sources on the slopes, the champagne\xe2\x80\x94and spirits\xe2\x80\x94were flowing in Verbier last weekend. Wills and his friends were photographed enjoying a liquid lunch with 24-year-old Australian model Sophie Taylor who works at the Farinet nightclub and a 30-year-old British former beautician from Blackpool named Rosie Peate who they met during the vacation. The group drank British beer, wine, and Jagerbombs and seemed to be in high spirits, with the prince high-fiving Sophie Taylor at one point during the lunch. Later William and his friends met up with the girls at another posh bar where the drinking continued.\n\nKate, who\xe2\x80\x99s not a big drinker, is apparently not the only wife said to be annoyed. Guy Pelly, whose other half, Lizzie Wilson, is about to give birth, is according to a source also \xe2\x80\x9cin deep trouble.\xe2\x80\x9d'"

(AP Photo/John Carucci, File)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \xe2\x80\x94 The French luxury house Longchamp will be there for the first time. So will Studio One Eighty Nine, the Ghana-based artisan initiative co-founded by actress Rosario Dawson. Look for Rihanna, but don\xe2\x80\x99t look for Victoria Beckham or Alexander Wang.\n\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s a never-ending churn to New York Fashion Week and its packed schedule of more than 200 September shows and other events is no different.\n\nHere\xe2\x80\x99s a rundown of who will be there, who won\xe2\x80\x99t and other highlights:\n\nRIHANNA\xe2\x80\x99S A YES\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe superstar\xe2\x80\x99s size-inclusive Savage x Fenty line of lingerie, undies and intimate accessories will close eight days of fashion with an \xe2\x80\x9cimmersive experience\xe2\x80\x9d the night of Sept. 12 in Brooklyn, because the fashion horde loves a good schlep to Brooklyn.\n\nNo matter. It\xe2\x80\x99s Rihanna after all.\n\nShe debuted the line in May with sizes ranging up to size 44DD in bras and 3XL in apparel. The latest will be available for immediate purchase on SavageX.com. Pop-ups in New York, Minnesota\xe2\x80\x99s Mall of America and elsewhere are planned.\n\nNEW ARRIVALS\n\nThe family-owned Longchamp is having its cake and eating it, too, as the company marks 70 years in business with its first full-scale runway show in New York. It was a big American-themed year for the house with the opening of a Fifth Avenue flagship store, a collaboration with Shayne Oliver and Kendall Jenner as its new face.\n\nLongchamp will also celebrate in Paris with a September event at the Opera Garnier, according to a company statement, as it has expanded in recent years from leather goods into ready-to-wear apparel.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLongchamp has always acted on intuition \xe2\x80\x94 something we can allow ourselves to do because we are independent \xe2\x80\x94 and we chose New York as we are inspired by the energy and freedom of the city,\xe2\x80\x9d the company said.\n\nWas Self Portrait similarly inspired as it landed on the New York schedule, or was it the London-based company\xe2\x80\x99s higher profile due to one particularly famous fan, Meghan the Duchess of Sussex?\n\nThe duchess wore a black-and-white dress from Self Portrait for her first go-around at Queen Elizabeth\xe2\x80\x99s annual Christmas lunch, before the wedding. The midi dress with a black lace top and pink and white details sold out quickly.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nDawson\xe2\x80\x99s Studio One Eighty Nine will also be on hand. It already has a store in New York, along with one in Accra, and a slew of awards. They include the prestigious Council of Fashion Designers of America Lexus Sustainable Fashion Initiative Award. The company has a manufacturing facility in Accra and supports artisan communities in Africa specializing in indigo, hand-batik and kente weaving. It supports initiatives aimed at empowering women, job programs and educational opportunities in the industry.\n\nWHO WON\xe2\x80\x99T BE THERE\n\nVictoria Beckham is celebrating 10 years in business and has decamped to London, where she\xe2\x80\x99ll show at the fashion week immediately following New York. The Brit built her empire in New York and her company remains based here.\n\nVera Wang has been off the fashion week hamster wheel for a while, as has Kanye West. And Philipp Plein? He polished up a huge spaceship for a wintry splash of a February show in New York after leaving Milan but has not yet spoken about future extravaganzas here.\n\nAs for Wang, he generated a lot of buzz earlier this year by announcing he would dump fashion week schedules altogether, choosing to show in June and December rather than participate in New York\xe2\x80\x99s weeks in February and September. The idea is to shorten the time consumers need to wait between reveal and store delivery, from six months to four. Other brands have followed suit.\n\nKATE SPADE NEW YORK\n\nSpade, the co-founder and former co-owner of the company with husband Andy Spade, killed herself in June. She and Spade created their first handbag line in 1993 and sold off bits of the company starting in 1999, cashing out completely in 2006. But the brand lives on and this will be its first runway show and the first time at fashion week since the loss of its namesake.\n\nThe show will be staged at the ornate main branch of the New York Public Library and will be the introduction of new designer Nicola Glass. A tribute was expected.\n\nWHO\xe2\x80\x99S BACK\n\nLos Angeles sisters Kate and Laura Mulleavy headed off to Paris couture week last year, but they announced on Instagram in July they\xe2\x80\x99d be returning to the New York ready-to-wear schedule in September to debut their latest.\n\nAnother returnee: New York-based Proenza Schouler. The design duo Jack McCollough and Lazaro Hernandez showed in Paris for two seasons but took to Instagram in June to say they\xe2\x80\x99d be back at New York Fashion Week, where it all began, come September.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNY will always be home,\xe2\x80\x9d the two said in the post. \xe2\x80\x9cParis was an amazing opportunity to show what we do to a completely different audience that had never been able to attend a Proenza Schouler show and on that level, as well as on a creative level, it felt really right.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTHE CURVY CON\n\nCoinciding with fashion week is a three-day convention (Sept. 6-8) celebrating the plus-size community. This time, Gabourey Sidibe will be the keynote speaker at The Curvy Con, now in its fourth year. Also on hand: The WWE and \xe2\x80\x9cTotal Divas\xe2\x80\x9d stars Brie Bella, Nikki Bella and Nia Jax will be on a panel to discuss body positivity.\n\nThe retail chain Loft is hosting a shop-able fashion show. The company launched plus sizing (up to 26) for online purchase in February. They\xe2\x80\x99ll begin to roll out plus offerings in stores Sept. 4. The Loft will include five attendees of The Curvy Con (TheCurvyCon.com) among its walkers for the runway show.'"

"b'There was no shortage of celebrity beefs in 2017.\n\nWhether the fights were between co-stars or once close friends, the shade just kept coming. Let\'s take a look back at the most intense celebrity feuds of the year.\n\n1. Blac Chyna vs. Rob Kardashian\n\nBlac Chyna and Rob Kardashian\'s split turned a new level of nasty when the former couple exchanged wild accusations against one another in a heated, NSFW social media war in June. Kardashian shared graphic naked photos of Chyna, accused her of cheating on him multiple times and also accused her of being on drugs. Meanwhile, Chyna took to Snapchat to accuse Kardashian of also cheating on her and being physically abusive.\n\nOne month later, a judge granted Chyna\'s request for a temporary restraining order against Kardashian.\n\n""Revenge porn is a form of domestic abuse,"" Chyna\'s attorney, Lisa Bloom, said during a press conference.\n\nGreg Doherty/Getty Images\n\nBut the two now appear to be keeping it amicable when it comes to their daughter, 1-year-old Dream. In September, the two reached a custody agreement.\n\n""Chyna is pleased that Rob has agreed to peacefully co-parent Dream with her, as she has been requesting all along,"" Bloom said in a statement.\n\nKardashian\xe2\x80\x99s attorney, Robert Shapiro, also told ET at the time that ""Rob and Chyna are working together to put the best interest of their child first and have amicably resolved their personal matters.""\n\nOf course, Chyna is still suing Kardashian, his mom Kris Jenner and sister Kim Kardashian West over the cancellation of E!\xe2\x80\x99s Rob & Chyna.\n\n2. Dwayne Johnson vs. Tyrese Gibson\n\nAlberto E. Rodriguez/Getty Images\n\nThe drama between the Fast and Furious co-stars began in September, when Gibson left a comment on Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s Instagram post, asking him not to let a rumored spinoff film starring Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s character, Agent Hobbs, push back the planned release date of Fast 9.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m simply trying to reach him cause he won\xe2\x80\x99t call me back about this solo #HobbsMovie,\xe2\x80\x9d Gibson wrote in the lengthy comment. \xe2\x80\x9cI want you to shoot it just not right now cause the #Fast9 release date has already been announced.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe feud escalated one month later, when Gibson called out Johnson on Instagram, and slammed his critical and commercial flop, Baywatch.\n\n\n\nJohnson defended himself on Twitter.\n\n""My goal from day 1 was to come in and create an exciting/fun character for the fans, elevate the franchise and build it out,"" he tweeted.\n\nGibson also took to Twitter, to call his co-star ""selfish.""\n\n""The real selfish #CandyA** revealed,"" Gibson wrote. ""And why you on Twitter?? You lost my number right?

Kanye West vs. JAY-Z\n\nGetty Images\n\nThe two close friends and collaborators\' falling out continued this year, after West publicly called JAY-Z out during an onstage concert rant last November.\n\n""You got hurt, because this guy was talking about you on a stage,"" JAY-Z commented in August during an interview with Elliott Wilson and Brian ""B.Dot"" Miller on the Rap Radar podcast. ""But what really hurt me, you can\'t bring my kid or my wife into it. Like, Kanye is my little brother. He\'s talked about me a hundred times. He even made a song called \xe2\x80\x98Big Brother.\' We\'ve gotten past bigger issues, but you brought my family into it, now it\'s a problem.""\n\nIn July, West reportedly left JAY-Z\xe2\x80\x99s Tidal over a money dispute.\n\nHowever, there is hope for those wishing for a Watch the Throne part two. During a Q&A with New York Times executive editor Dean Baquet for T: The New York Times Style Magazine in November, JAY-Z had a few conciliatory words for West, whom he still referred to as his ""brother.""\n\n""I [talked to] Kanye the other day, just to tell him, like, he\'s my brother,"" he recalled. ""I love Kanye. I do. It\'s a complicated relationship with us.""\n\nStill, JAY-Z admitted that there\'s currently tension between the two.\n\n""But that happens,"" he stressed. ""In the long relationship, you know, hopefully when we\'re 89 we look at this six months or whatever time and we laugh at that. There\'s gonna be complications in the relationship that we have to get through. And the only way to get through that is we sit down and have a dialogue and say, \'These are the things that I\'m uncomfortable with. These are the things that are unacceptable to me. This is what I feel.\' I\'m sure he feels that I\'ve done things to him as well. I\'m not a perfect human being by no stretch.""\n\n""[West is] a very compassionate person,"" he added. And a lot of times he get in trouble trying to help others, So, I can identify with it. It\'s just that there\'s certain things that happened that\'s not really acceptable to me. ... And we just need to speak about it. But there\'s genuine love there.""\n\n4. Camila Cabello vs. Fifth Harmony\n\nGetty Images\n\nThings turned messy between girl group Fifth Harmony and Camila Cabello pretty quickly after she announced she was leaving the group last December, and the remaining members -- Lauren Jauregui, Ally Brooke, Normani Kordei and Dinah Jane -- claimed in a statement that they only learned of her departure through her representatives.\n\nIn an interview with Billboard in February, Cabello talked about the \xe2\x80\x9cintense\xe2\x80\x9d split and admitted she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t spoken to her former bandmates.\n\n""I was always super open [that] I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t just sing other people\xe2\x80\x99s words and be totally happy with that,"" Cabello said of exiting the group. ""You have to follow and honor that inner voice. I always encouraged the girls to do the same.""\n\n""I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get into the details of that, because it was really intense and it\xe2\x80\x99s hard for me to talk about,"" she added about not keeping in touch. ""It makes me sad.""\n\nIn their own Billboard interview in July, Fifth Harmony wasn\xe2\x80\x99t shy about alluding to the bad blood.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s just say we\xe2\x80\x99re in a better place now -- there are no secrets in this circle,\xe2\x80\x9d Jane said of Cabello\'s exit.\n\nHowever, the shadiest moment definitely happened at the MTV Video Music Awards in August, when before their performance of ""Angel"" and ""Down,"" a a fifth member of the group -- presumably meant to represent Cabello -- fell backwards off the stage.\n\nThe group later denied they were slamming Cabello during an interview with Good Morning America.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe get asked all the time if we\xe2\x80\x99re getting a fifth member,\xe2\x80\x9d Brooke explained. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd we wanted to show the world in an artistic way that, \xe2\x80\x98Hey, the four of us are Fifth Harmony. We are stronger and better than we\xe2\x80\x99ve ever been.""\n\n5. Kim Cattrall vs. Sex and the City Cast\n\nNew Line Cinema\n\nRumors have floated around for some time now that Kim Cattrall didn\'t get along with her Sex and the City cast members, and they were pretty much confirmed this year, after Sarah Jessica Parker announced that there would be no Sex and the City 3 film.\n\n""It\'s over... we\'re not doing it,"" she told Extra. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m disappointed. We had this beautiful, funny, heartbreaking, joyful, very relatable script and story. It\xe2\x80\x99s not just disappointing that we don\xe2\x80\x99t get to tell the story and have that experience, but more so for that audience that has been so vocal in wanting another movie.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe Daily Mail later reported that it was Cattrall\'s ""demands"" that put a stop to the project, claiming she insisted that Warner Bros. produce other movies she had in development before signing onto SATC 3. Cattrall denied the report on Twitter.\n\nWoke 2 a @MailOnline \xf0\x9f\x92\xa9storm! The only \'DEMAND\' I ever made was that I didn\'t want to do a 3rd film....& that was back in 2016 \xe2\x80\x94 Kim Cattrall (@KimCattrall) September 29, 2017\n\nCattrall then specifically called out Parker during an interview with Piers Morgan for ITV\'s Life Stories.\n\n""At this very moment, it\xe2\x80\x99s quite extraordinary to get any kind of negative press about something that I\xe2\x80\x99ve been saying for almost a year,"" she noted. ""This is really where I take to task the people from Sex and the City, specifically Sarah Jessica Parker, in that I think she could have been nicer,"" she expressed to Morgan. ""I really think she could have been nicer.""\n\n""I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what her issue is, I never have,"" she added.\n\nCattrall also said she was never friends with her SATC co-stars, including Cynthia Nixon and Kristin Davis.\n\n""We\xe2\x80\x98ve been colleagues and in some ways, it\xe2\x80\x99s a very healthy place to be because then you have a clear line between your professional life and relationship and your personal,"" she noted. ""They all have children and I am 10 years older, and since, specifically, the series ended, I have been spending most of my time outside of New York, so, I don\xe2\x80\x99t see them. The common ground that we had was the series, and the series is over.""\n\nThough she did admit that she wishes her co-stars would try harder to keep in touch, after sharing that she couldn\'t even recall the last time she had spoken to them.\n\n""That\xe2\x80\x99s another thing that\xe2\x80\x99s really disappointing, is that nobody ever picks up the phone and tries to contact you and say, \xe2\x80\x98How you doing?\xe2\x80\x99"" she shared.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa6. And it appears the cast is taking sides. Willie Garson -- who portrayed Stanford Blatch, the best friend of Carrie Bradshaw (Parker) in both the TV series and the movies -- posted a cryptic tweet in October that appeared to be aimed at Cattrall. Cattrall repeatedly denied that she ever considered doing a third SATC movie and further claimed that she never began contract negotiations.\n\n""Dear fans, because I\'m ""toxic,"" I\'m going to negotiate a contract for 6 months, not come to terms, then say I never wanted to do it anyway,\'"" he wrote.\n\nDear fans, because I\'m ""toxic"", I\'m going to negotiate a contract for 6 months, not come to terms, then say I never wanted to do it anyway. \xe2\x80\x94 Willie Garson \xf0\x9f\x87\xba\xf0\x9f\x87\xb8 (@WillieGarson) October 4, 2017\n\n6. Katy Perry vs. Taylor Swift\n\n\n\nGetty Images\n\nThe epic Katy Perry vs. Taylor Swift feud continued with the promotion of both their respective albums this year -- Perry\'s Witness and Swift\'s Reputation. Perry didn\'t hold back during her Carpool Karaoke segment with James Corden in June, addressing the beef head-on.\n\n""Honestly, it\'s really like she started it and it\'s time for her to finish it,"" Perry said after the Late Late Show host asked her to clear things up. ""She wouldn\'t speak to me. I do the right thing any time that it feels like a fumble. It was a full shutdown and then she writes a song about me and I\'m like, \'OK, cool, cool, cool. That\'s how you wanna deal with it?\'""\n\nIn an interview with NME, Perry gave background on why she decided to address the feud with Corden.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean, I\xe2\x80\x99m not Buddha -- things irritate me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI wish that I could turn the other cheek every single time, but I\xe2\x80\x99m also not a pushover, you know? Especially when someone tries to assassinate my character with little girls [her fans]. That\xe2\x80\x99s so messed up!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThough Swift stayed silent on Perry\'s comments about her, she let her actions do the talking. Swift surprisingly announced on June 8 that her entire catalog will return to all streaming services at midnight -- just when Perry\'s Witness dropped.\n\nSwift also took thinly veiled digs at Perry in her ""Look What You Made Me Do"" music video that dropped in August. Swift dresses up very similar to Perry in the shade-filled video and gets into a car crash -- a moment that looks very close to the accident in Perry\'s ""Unconditionally"" music video. She also pointedly holds a GRAMMY, highlighting that she has 10 accolades, while Perry has zero.\n\nLater, Swift is in a vault, robbing a bank and wearing a sweatshirt that features a glittery tiger, along with a cat mask, seemingly mocking the name of Perry\'s fanbase, KatyCats.\n\nYouTube\n\n7. Caitlyn Jenner vs. The Kardashians\n\nGetty Images\n\nCaitlyn Jenner\'s relationship with the Kardashian family deteriorated after the August release of her memoir, The Secret of My Life, which didn\'t exactly paint the Kardashians in a positive light. Kris Jenner claimed on Keeping Up With the Kardashians that Caitlyn\'s stories about her were ""all made up.""\n\n""My mom has been so fair to Cait, and Cait just has no decency towards my mom whatsoever,"" Kim Kardashian West later told KUWTK cameras, clearly siding with her mother. ""I feel like my mom is carrying this burden and feeling like she had to maintain a relationship with Caitlyn for all the kids. But we\'re grown up. I don\'t think my mom has to try anymore. It\'s time to move on.""\n\nIn September, Caitlyn said she hadn\'t spoken to Kris or Kim since the book\'s release.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI went overboard to be nice, to be friendly, to be open, but also tell my story and my side of the story,\xe2\x80\x9d Caitlyn said during an appearance on Good Morning Britain. \xe2\x80\x9cSince the book came out, I\xe2\x80\x99ve never talked to Kris again. Kim, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t talked to in six, nine months, whatever it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n""It\xe2\x80\x99s unfortunate, because actually Kim was the first one I talked to about this issue,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued. ""She was very straightforward with me. She\xe2\x80\x99s been very, very good on it. It\xe2\x80\x99s a big loss in my life, not having her there anymore. To me, I mean, that\xe2\x80\x99s sad.""\n\nCurrently, the relationship is showing no signs of repair.\n\nThe I Am Cait star spoke to students at Cambridge Union in England in November, where amid discussing her 2015 transition and its aftermath, she revealed that she and Kim haven\'t spoken in ""a year.""\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s been a little bit tough over the last couple of years on the Kardashian side,"" Caitlyn acknowledged. ""To be honest, I don\'t talk to them anymore. Kim, I haven\'t talked to in a year.""\n\n""They don\'t want me in their lives, they bashed me pretty badly,"" she continued. ""It\'s devastating when your kids do that. It really hurt.""\n\n8. Drake Bell vs. Josh Peck\n\nGetty Images\n\nThe state of the Drake & Josh co-stars\' friendship made headlines in June, when Bell made it clear he was upset that he wasn\'t invited to Peck\'s wedding to Paige O\'Brien. Although Bell wasn\'t present at the ceremony, Peck\'s Grandfathered co-star, John Stamos, was, as well as Jason Nash, whom Peck also acted with on Drake & Josh.\n\nIn now deleted tweets, Bell made his feelings known.\n\n""When you\'re not invited to the wedding the message is clear\xe2\x80\xa6"" Bell tweeted. ""Loyalty is key\xe2\x80\xa6 ALWAYS remember where you came from.""\n\n""True colors have come out today,"" he added. ""Message is loud and clear. Ties are officially cut. I\'ll miss ya brotha.""\n\nFor his part, Peck made it clear that he no longer had a close relationship with Bell during his appearance on the Allegedly with Theo Von & Matthew Cole Weiss podcast.\n\nET spoke to Bell in July, when he explained the emotional tweets.\n\n""We\'ve been together 18 years, Josh and me, me and Josh,"" Bell shared. ""We\'ve been so close, it was just one of those things where, you know, I\'d been talking to him, and he\'s been telling me about the engagement. And then I saw on social media, the wedding, and I didn\'t hear about it. So, it was just one of those things where it was just like, \'You didn\'t even tell me?! I had to find out on social media?\' And then you\'re like, \'You know what!? Fine!\' and then I\'m like, wait, I probably shouldn\'t have done that.""\n\n""Yeah, I said the ties are cut or whatever, but I should have just texted that to him, you know,"" he continued. ""I was just being cranky.""\n\nTo solidify that the two had no hard feelings, they later reunited at the MTV VMAs in August.\n\n9. Justin Bieber vs. Marilyn Manson\n\n\n\nMatt Winkelmeyer, Kevin Mazur/Getty Images\n\nOne of the most bizarre feuds of the year was between pop star Justin Bieber and goth rocker Marilyn Manson. During an interview with Billboard in September, Manson said he confronted Bieber at a bar when he saw that the ""Sorry"" singer was selling shirts with Manson\'s face on the front and Bieber\'s name on the back, as part of his official Purpose World Tour merchandise.\n\n""I saw a little girl in a pink hoodie with blond hair, and it turns out to be Bieber. I sit down, and I say, \'Hey, so you wore my shirt and everything onstage,\'"" Manson recalled. ""He was one of those touchy people that hit you when they talk, and he comes up to about d**k height. Then he goes, \'I made you relevant again.\'""\n\nManson said he got revenge by not showing up to a planned duet between the two at Bieber\xe2\x80\x99s show that he suggested.\n\n""I reply, \'That was a great idea you had about doing [my song] \'The Beautiful People\' at your show at Staples Center tomorrow.\' And he goes, \'Yeah, it was,\' not knowing that I told him an idea that I had just made up,"" Manson shared. ""His tour manager sat down, and I asked, \'What time is sound check tomorrow? What time should I be there? Because we\xe2\x80\x99re going to do \'Beautiful People.\xe2\x80\x99 Obviously, when 4 p.m. rolled around the next day, I just didn\'t show.""\n\nManson later claimed Bieber apologized to him through text during Manson\xe2\x80\x99s appearance on Howard Stern\'s Sirius XM show.\n\nQuoting Bieber\xe2\x80\x99s supposed texts, Manson read, \xe2\x80\x9cHonestly, I totally thought we hit it off. My bad. If I was an a**hole, it wasn\'t my intention.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n""I don\'t really care about the media,"" Manson continued to read from Bieber\'s supposed texts. ""I just wanna make sure you and I were good. \xe2\x80\x98Cause I like you.""\n\nManson further reflected on their feud.\n\n""He sassed me and he apologized,"" Manson explained. ""And I said I wouldn\'t s**t talk him, so I wouldn\'t s**t talk him.""\n\n'"

"b'Not so fast! Madonna was hit with a series of \xe2\x80\x9cuncomfortable questions\xe2\x80\x9d by a judge before she was granted permission to adopt her 4-year-old twin girls from Malawi, the presiding judge said in court documents obtained by The Associated Press on Wednesday, February 8.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe petitioner is a professional performer and I guarded myself against the danger of her merely reciting a well-rehearsed speech by asking her some rather uncomfortable questions to which she gave very candid answers,\xe2\x80\x9d Judge Fiona Mwale said in her ruling, explaining her reasons for approving the adoption.\n\nAfter pressing Madonna, 58, to explain her intentions in adding two more little ones to her brood of four, Judge Mwale said she was satisfied that the girls would be in good hands with the Material Girl.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no doubt that the petitioner can offer the infants not only the best education money can buy, but also guidance with a high likelihood of ensuring that the two infants grow to be self-sufficient adults,\xe2\x80\x9d Judge Mwale said, adding that she is satisfied that Madonna \xe2\x80\x9cis motivated by her desire to offer a home, love, protection and guidance to the infants.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIn the court documents, Judge Mwale addressed prior controversies surrounding Madonna\xe2\x80\x99s adoptions in Malawi. \xe2\x80\x9cIn determining her motives, I questioned the petitioner at length about the impact of her decision which could be construed as robbing Malawi of its most precious resource, its children,\xe2\x80\x9d the judge wrote.\n\nAs previously reported, Madonna filed for adoption in High Court in Malawi on January 25 but tried to keep the process under wraps until a final decision was made. (The Queen of Pop issued a statement denying her adoption to Us Weekly that same day, claiming that she was in Malawi \xe2\x80\x9cto check on the children\xe2\x80\x99s hospital in Blantyre.\xe2\x80\x9d) According to the AP, she has already raised $7.5 million for a pediatric surgery ward at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital in Blantyre, which is set to open early next year.\n\nMadonna previously adopted son David and daughter Mercy James, both 11, from Malawi in 2008 and 2009, respectively. She is also mom to daughter Lourdes, 20, whom she shares with ex Carlos Leon, and son Rocco, 16, whom she shares with ex-husband Guy Ritchie.\n\nMadonna\xe2\x80\x99s twin girls will retain their birth names as a part of an effort to preserve their identity as Malawian nationals, the court documents said, and their father was at the January 25 court hearing with Madonna. (The twins\xe2\x80\x99 mother died within a week of childbirth due to health complications.)\n\nOn Wednesday, February 8, Madonna took to social media to share the happy news. \xe2\x80\x9cI can officially confirm I have completed the process of adopting twin sisters from Malawi and am overjoyed that they are now part of our family,\xe2\x80\x9d she captioned an image of herself walking between the two little girls. \xe2\x80\x9cI am deeply grateful to all those in Malawi who helped make this possible, and I ask the media please to respect our privacy during this transitional time. \xf0\x9f\x99\x8f\xf0\x9f\x8f\xbb Thank you also to my friends, family and my very large team for all your support and Love!\xe2\x80\x9d'"
"b'WASHINGTON \xe2\x80\x94 President Trump on Wednesday rescinded protections for transgender students that had allowed them to use bathrooms corresponding with their gender identity, overruling his own education secretary and placing his administration firmly in the middle of the culture wars that many Republicans have tried to leave behind.\n\nIn a joint letter, the top civil rights officials from the Justice Department and the Education Department rejected the Obama administration\xe2\x80\x99s position that nondiscrimination laws require schools to allow transgender students to use the bathrooms of their choice.\n\nThat directive, they said, was improperly and arbitrarily devised, \xe2\x80\x9cwithout due regard for the primary role of the states and local school districts in establishing educational policy.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe question of how to address the \xe2\x80\x9cbathroom debate,\xe2\x80\x9d as it has become known, opened a rift inside the Trump administration, pitting Education Secretary Betsy DeVos against Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Mr. Sessions, who had been expected to move quickly to roll back the civil rights expansions put in place under his Democratic predecessors, wanted to act decisively because of two pending court cases that could have upheld the protections and pushed the government into further litigation.'"

"b""For Gwen Stefani, her new Las Vegas residency is a lifesaver.\n\nThat is because the consistent Vegas shows allow Stefani, 48, to live the rest of her life. \xe2\x80\x9cAs a mom, if you look at my touring for the last ten years, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t really toured,\xe2\x80\x9d she told journalist Allison Kugel. \xe2\x80\x9cI toured for seven years and it\xe2\x80\x99s hard with the kids because they\xe2\x80\x99re in school and I\xe2\x80\x99m not homeschooling, and you can\xe2\x80\x99t pull them out. It\xe2\x80\x99s not fair to them.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did my last tour because I had this unexpected life crisis and then the music came pouring out of me from that,\xe2\x80\x9d Stefani explained. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was such a lifesaver and a beautiful moment for me to be able to write again. I put that tour on at the last minute and went on a summer tour with the kids. It was so much fun for them, they loved it.

"b'We know it\xe2\x80\x99s serious when a couple moves in together. Jennifer Lopez and Alex Rodriguez, however, isn\xe2\x80\x99t your average couple moving in together, so when they do \xe2\x80\x94 they do it big. The couple \xe2\x80\x94 who\xe2\x80\x99ve been hot and heavy for a year now, are taking their relationship to the next level by purchasing a penthouse together.\n\nWhile the couple have been basically living together at Jennifer\xe2\x80\x99s house in Los Angeles, they have now gone in on something as a real committed unit. It\xe2\x80\x99s being reported that J.Lo and A.Rod have been thinking of moving in together for a few months now. Jennifer put up her previous penthouse ( $27 million!) on the market in October. So what\xe2\x80\x99s up with the new place? Here are some deets:\n\nThe penthouse is located at 432 Park Avenue \xe2\x80\x94 also known as the tallest residential building in Manhattan. It cost the couple a whopping $15.32 million (why does it sound like a step down from her previous place?). The penthouse is stacked with three bedrooms, four and half bathrooms, and a library, Curbed reports.\n\nHere\xe2\x80\x99s some more details, according to Variety: \xe2\x80\x9cA private elevator landing and a 21-plus-foot entrance gallery lead to a nearly 30-foot square combination living and dining room with 12.5-foot ceilings, solid oak floorboards laid at a herringbone pattern and four, ten-foot square single pane windows with staggering open views to the north and east across the city and the entirety of Central Park.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHere are some of the cons that have been reported about this building. Some drawbacks to living in the tallest residential building: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been up in that building, and it sways quite a bit. You can feel it,\xe2\x80\x9d New York real estate agent Dolly Lenz tells realtor.com. Some have also said it looks like a trashcan because that was the \xe2\x80\x9cinspiration\xe2\x80\x9d behind its design. Other reports say, because mostly business-types own places there, that no one is ever in the building.\n\nWell, who gives a damn!?

The Devil Wears Prada actress dispelled such theories regarding on-set ""catfights,"" and she instead shared how she ""admired"" her castmates.\n\n""It\'s been really amazing to watch the way certain members of the media have wanted us to fight each other and the way they wanted there to be competition and catfights, but we were all collaborating\xe2\x80\x94all the time,"" Hathaway told Today host Hod Kotb.

That\'s what it has been in my life and I don\'t know why I thought it couldn\'t be that way at work. I guess it is because I was fed this myth. But we all have had an experience that disproved it.""\n\nIt\'s true that some actresses suffer from on-set drama, including Sex and the City alums Sarah Jessica Parker and Kim Cattrall in addition to Betty White and Bea Arthur from Golden Girls. Bullock, however, revealed that the powerhouse women did Kegels together as a bonding activity. The stars also shared a group text, which is now ""disbanded.""\n\n""Because of all the talk, we\'ve disbanded it,"" Bullock, 53, said Thursday to USA Today.

See here how they creatively sought help.\n\nKhloe Kardashian, 33, and Tristan Thompson, 27, are on a major time crunch! The duo have yet to come up with a name for their baby daughter, and, considering Khloe is due to give birth later this month, they have to settle on something \xe2\x80\x94 and fast! Feeling the pressure, the parents-to-be decided to solicit help from guests at their baby shower on March 10. While we know the idea isn\xe2\x80\x99t particularly original or unique, it\xe2\x80\x99s definitely brilliant \xe2\x80\x94 and who knows, maybe they found a gem in the suggestion box! Click here to see pics of Khloe Kardashian\xe2\x80\x99s maternity style.\n\nAs evident from the below photo, which Khloe posted via Instagram Stories, the expectant mom asked guests to write down their name ideas during the lavish party. Placed on a round table along with pink roses and markers, was a card reading, \xe2\x80\x9cHelp Khloe find a name for Baby Thompson.\xe2\x80\x9d And you know what \xe2\x80\x94 it might just work! After all, Ellen DeGeneres, 60, proved you never know where baby-name inspo will come from after she revealed she named Adam Levine, 38, and Behati Prinsloo\xe2\x80\x98s, 28, first child, Dusty Rose. We love that Khloe and Tristan decided to open up the conversation to their loved ones as well.\n\nAlso at the baby shower, guests were surrounded by all pink everything \xe2\x80\x94 balloons, treats, flowers, etc. There was even a gorgeous neon pink sign that said \xe2\x80\x9cBaby Thompson.\xe2\x80\x9d Clearly Khloe and Tristan are pumped about meeting their little one! However, the extravagant soiree, as Khloe admitted, was sponsored by Amazon, and fans have been giving her MAJOR flak for it. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd why did @Amazon sponsor your shower? This makes me sick! #BoycottAmazon\xe2\x80\x9d one person tweeted after Khloe revealed it was the shower of her \xe2\x80\x9cdreams.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnother fan wrote, \xe2\x80\x9cI guess I just don\xe2\x80\x99t understand the idea of amazon gifting a baby shower to khloe kardashian.

It is clearly disgusting and completely inappropriate.'\n\nA source told Page Six: 'Kathy totally misjudged this. She truly believed that Anderson would stick up for her. She considered him a friend. While she has nobody to blame but herself, she feels somehow betrayed.'\n\nScroll down for video\n\nKathy Griffin gave a tearful press conference on Friday after being hit with a wave of criticism for posting an image in which she appeared to be holding Donald Trump's severed head\n\nKathy Griffin is said to feel betrayed by friend and CNN host Anderson Cooper after she was axed from the network over the Trump severed head photo scandal\n\nGriffin broke down in tears during a press conference with her lawyer Lisa Bloom on Friday when she was asked to comment on Cooper's criticism of her.\n\n'That hurt, that's all,' she said tearfully.\n\nThe 56-year-old had already apologized for the photo on Tuesday before deciding to hold the press conference, during which she accused Trump and his family of launching a campaign to destroy her life.\n\nA top Hollywood publicist told The Wrap that Griffin's news conference only made things worse.\n\n'If she were my client, I'd tell her to shut the f*** up,' the unnamed publicist said.\n\n'You're not talking to anyone and you're certainly not talking to Lisa Bloom anymore.'\n\nOn Friday, Griffin tearfully detailed the torrent of abuse she has been receiving online and the constant death threats.\n\nShe stated however that she will not back down from this fight, saying: 'I am not afraid of Donald Trump. He is a bully.'\n\nGriffin said her career was likely over now as a result of the incident, and that President Trump had 'broke' her, moments after she declared: 'There's a bunch of old white guys trying to silence me!'\n\nShe said at one point that this would not be happening to her if she was a 'white man.'\n\nBreaking it down: Griffin also tried to explain the reason behind the photo and video shoot by saying: 'I am not good at being appropriate'\n\nGriffin's long-time co-host Anderson Cooper also criticized her on Twitter\n\nResponse: First lady Melania Trump (above on election night with Barron and Donald) rushed to protect her son, saying' 'As a mother, a wife, and a human being, that photo is very disturbing.'\n\nHer lawyer Lisa Bloom also suggested during the press conference that despite reports, Barron was likely not that upset after seeing the image of Griffin with the decapitated head by stating the child was 'allegedly' traumatized.\n\n'We don't know that. You're assuming that everything that Trump says is true, and in fact, we know that everything Trump says is false,' said Bloom.\n\nIt was also confirmed at the press conference that the Secret Service is investigating Griffin over the image, with the comedian saying: 'Yeah I might get arrested today. I don't care.'\n\nGriffin's criminal lawyer Dimitry Goran also joined her Friday.\n\n'I am really nervous, I have never done a press conference,' said Griffin after she was introduced by her lawyer.\n\nAfter making a few jokes and stating that she stands by the apology she released earlier this week, Griffin said: 'The president and his grown children and the first lady are personally trying to ruin my life forever.'\n\nShe then went back to that notion a few moments later, speaking in disbelief as she reiterated her claim that 'this president of all people is going to come after' an 'obnoxious comedian.'\n\nGriffin also tried to explain the reason behind the photo and video shoot by saying: 'I am not good at being appropriate.'\n\nTough day: Kathy Griffin broke down in tears speaking about the constant attacks from the public and members of the Trump family over the past few days\n\nShe added that she will not back down from this fight, saying: 'I am not afraid of Donald Trump. He is a bully'\n\nAggressors: Griffin declared at one point: 'There's a bunch of old white guys trying to silence me!' (Griffin and Trump together in 2010 on the season finale of The Apprentice with Brandy Kuentzel and Stephanie Castagnier)\n\nBack in the day: Griffin and President Trump first met in 1995 she revealed in a recent interview, and he guest starred on her sitcom 'Suddenly Susan' in 1997 (above)\n\n'I am going to make fun of him more now,' said Griffin of President Trump\n\nThat became clear soon after when she announced that she would not stop attacking President Trump just because he had targeted her.\n\n'I am going to make fun of him more now,' said Griffin.\n\nShe then made a point of adding: 'I am not going to threaten him, I have no desire to harm him.'\n\nGriffin was also ready with some thoughts on why President Trump had elected to attack her while his son Don Jr. called for her to be fired from her jobs.\n\n'They are using me as the shining object so no one talks about his FBI investigation,' said Griffin.\n\nShe then revealed that all she wanted to do was get back to work, something that is becoming difficult with five venues cancelling her show in the wake of the incident.\n\n'I'm not for everybody,. I am barely an acquired taste frankly,' admitted Griffin.\n\n'I've had everybody turn on me. And I just want to make people laugh.'\n\nThat being said, Griffin declared: 'I am not laying down for this guy.'\n\nShe later added towards the end of the press conference: 'It's a good time to be a comedian but a scary time to be a citizen.'\n\nThe comedian did not however say anything about her relationship with President Trump, who she has known for 20 years.\n\nShe also worked with him multiple times over the course of her career, most recently in the 2010 finale of 'The Apprentice,' where she also appeared alongside Ivanka and Don Jr.\n\nCalm before the storm: Griffin was seen arriving to the press conference on Friday morning (above)\n\nTeam: Griffin arrived with a group of three men including boyfriend Randy Bick (left) and a man who appeared to be a bodyguard (right)\n\nGriffin also said that it was Megyn Kelly who inspired her to take the image, saying: 'I started thinking of that Megyn Kelly thing. By the way, I'm sure Megyn Kelly can't stand me. I thought of that blood coming out of her eyes blood or coming out of her wherever.'\n\nThe comedian and Kelly previously had a run-in this past December at a Women In Hollywood breakfast.\n\nKelly was the emcee of the event, and when she began to speak about President Trump things took a turn.\n\n'I have high hopes for him. Despite the tweets and all the rest of it, there is much to admire about Donald Trump,' said Kelly, which immediately elicited booing from a few people, the loudest being comedian Kathy Griffin.\n\n'There is. Stop that, stop that. There's room for the loyal opposition in this country,' said Kelly at that point, a comment which resulted in Griffin screaming, 'F*** him.'\n\nKelly then responded: 'Guess who that is? Kathy Griffin.'\n\nGriffin later explained how things went down the day of the shoot.\n\n'Let's make this really obvious that I'm making an absurdist, artsy thing,' said Griffin.\n\n'For a few photos, I was holding up this wig head and we kept making the hair crazier.'\n\nShe went on to explain: ' We just took these pictures, it was interesting. There were a few people in the house. I didn't do anything for money.'\n\nGriffin said she just wanted to give people something to talk about, adding: 'You interpret it the way you want.'\n\nIt was an emotional appearance for Griffin, who most difficult moment came when she began to wail while saying of President Trump: 'He broke me. He broke me. He broke me.'\n\nThat was when Griffin said she realized that 'this isn't right.'\n\n'I've dealt with white guys trying to keep me down my entire career,' said Griffin.\n\n'I had learned over the years that sometimes when you do standup, people want a joke that's out there and a little crazy.'\n\nShe went on to say: 'I feel horrible. I have performed in war zones. Trust me, if we could redo the whole thing I'd have a blowup doll and ketchup. If you don't stand up you get run over.'\n\nThus far, Griffin had had five tour dates cancelled, lost her endorsement deal with Squatty Potty and been fired by CNN.\n\nGriffin also found some time for humor, joking about President Trump at one point by saying: 'If you meet him he wants to call you The Donald. I said I am The Kathy, and that went over his nest.'\n\nShe also poked fun at her conservative mother Maggie, quipping: 'My mother is not speaking to me because she is in love with Tucker Carlson.'\n\nHer lawyer Lisa Bloom meanwhile seemed to dismiss the idea that Barron Trump, 11, was disturbed by the image, saying he was 'allegedly traumatized'\n\nPhotoshop protest: A man rushed the podium at one point holding an image of Griffin with Bloom's decapitated head (above)\n\nA little mystery to figure out: Griffin said she just wanted to give people something to talk about, adding: 'You interpret it the way you want.'\n\nBeen around the block: 'I've dealt with white guys trying to keep me down my entire career,' said Griffin.\n\nSmile through the tears: She also poked fun at her conservative mother Maggie, quipping: 'My mother is not speaking to me because she is in love with Tucker Carlson'\n\nGriffin joked about going after Barron in her stand-up act back in December\n\nGriffin joked about going after Barron in her stand-up act back in December in an interview with Vulture.\n\n'Now more than ever we must absolutely go for all the absurdities,' said Griffin.\n\n'For me, that's Trump and all things Trump. It's not about trying to be an equal-opportunity offender anymore because Hillary got such a beat down. It's his turn.'\n\nShe continued: 'So I'm happy to deliver beat down to Donald Trump - and also to Barron. You know a lot of comics are going to go hard for Donald, my edge is that I'll go direct for Barron. I'm going to get in ahead of the game.'\n\nThat comment spurred Don Jr. to comment after Griffin's interview, writing on Twitter: 'To put everything into perspective this is a must read from Dec 16 even states it's ok to go after Barron an 11 y/o.'\n\nMost would take issue with an adult targeting a child for ridicule, but Griffin's lawyer said on Friday that she should not have lost any jobs over this image.\n\nThe only reason she did lose those jobs however explained Bloom, was because of the Trump family.\n\n'As a result of the first family bullying her, she has been vilified, getting death threats, fired from multiple jobs and had multiple events canceled,' said Bloom.\n\nThose death threats are more serious than the loss of work for Griffin, who said: 'This is America, and you shouldn't have to die for it. The death threats I am getting are constant and they are detailed.'\n\nGriffin then made a point of adding: 'Today it's me. Tomorrow it could be you.'\n\nBloom also stressed her client's impeccable record and the fact that she has never committed an act of violence or assault before, stating: 'Kathy never imagined it could be misinterpreted as a threat of violence against Trump. That was never what she intended.'\n\nThe victim's rights lawyer, who also represented a number of former employees who are suing Fox News, also noted of the photo shoot: 'This was clearly a parody of Trump's own sexist remarks, taken to an extreme, edgy visual.'\n\nShe used her introduction to explain why President Trump's actions against Griffin were such a problem.\n\n'Kathy and Donald Trump are not equals. He's the president of the United States. He's not just Donald Trump, real estate developer, and this isn't just another celebrity feud,' said Bloom.\n\n'He's the president of the United States. His family is calling on Kathy on Twitter to be fired from all of her jobs. This is outrageous and unprecedented.'\n\nGriffin also pointed out what she claimed was another difference between herself and President Trump, saying: 'I go town to town with my dick jokes and try to make people laugh. I didn't grab anyone's you know what.'\n\nComparisons: 'Kathy and Donald Trump are not equals. He's the president of the United States. He's not just Donald Trump, real estate developer, and this isn't just another celebrity feud,' said Bloom\n\nTruce: Bloom added: 'He's the president of the United States. His family is calling on Kathy on Twitter to be fired from all of her jobs. This is outrageous and unprecedented'\n\nInconsolable: 'This is America, and you shouldn't have to die for it. The death threats I am getting are constant and they are detailed,' said Griffin (above)\n\nWarning shot: Griffin then made a point of adding: 'Today it's me. Tomorrow it could be you'\n\n'I go town to town with my dick jokes and try to make people laugh. I didn't grab anyone's you know what,' said Griffin\n\nGriffin thinks that ultimately she was targeted because of her sex and her level of fame.\n\n'It's quite clear they're trying to use me as a distraction and I'm not going to be collateral damage for this fool,' said Griffin.\n\n'I'm the easiest target. I'm D-list comedian Kathy Griffin.'\n\nAnd while she wanted to stay quiet, she was afraid about others suffering a fate similar to her own she explained on Friday.\n\n'He broke me and then I was like 'No, this isn't right,'' said Griffin.\n\n'I apologized because was the right thing to do. Then it became a mob mentality pile-on.'\n\nGriffin, who said she is '110 pounds when wet,' went on to explain: 'He's not just Donald Trump, real estate developer, having a celebrity feud He's using the power of the government.'\n\nBloom made a similar comment, stating: 'The message was clear: Criticize the president, lose your job.'\n\nShe also noted: 'Ted Nugent threatened to kill President Obama. President Trump invited him to the White House.'\n\nThe lawyer's anger towards President Trump also turned a but personal at one point it seemed, when she shouted out at one reporter: 'There's a lot of disgusting stuff on the news every day, like the fact that [President Trump is] making us the laughing stock of the world.'\n\nGetaway: Griffin was seen being driven home by her longtime boyfriend Bick after her press conference on Friday\n\nPricey ride: The couple were riding in a Maserati Quattroporte, which start at over $100,000\n\nEyes forward: Griffin did not look at the photographers as she made her exit out of her attorney's office\n\nSafe and sound: The comedian's bodyguard could be seen sitting in the backseat of the car\n\nGriffin spoke about President Trump at length in an interview this past March with CityBeat Cincinnati, revealing that the two had known one another for two decades.\n\n'I've known him off and on since 1995,' said Griffin.\n\n'I feel very privileged to be able to bring my own personal run-ins with 'The Cheeto' to audiences all over, but most importantly to Cincinnati. The Taft Theatre audience needs to hear from someone who has met him several times'\n\nGriffin admitted in the interview that she never had a particularly high opinion of President Trump.\n\n'I found him to always be a buffoon,' she explained.\n\n'But honestly, and I think unfortunately, a lot of people just thought he was harmless.'\n\nShe then revealed that President Trump would often ask her to not go after him during her stand-up routines.\n\n'Almost every time I've run into this fool, he comes up to me and says, 'Uh, oh, don't be too hard on me. I know you're going to be funny, but you can be tough,'' said Griffin.\n\n'I find that fascinating.'\n\nShe also mentioned that one of her best friends, the late Joan Rivers, was also incredibly close to President Trump.\n\n'I think she got a kick out of him, but I don't think she knew this side of him,' said Griffin.\n\n'I don't know if anybody knew he was this racist and stupid, because I think you assume that people who have done well in one area or another have a certain acumen or certain talents.'\n\nRough week: She said that she has been receiving constant death threats, which she described as detailed and specific\n\nNot a fan: Griffin admitted in a March interview that she never had a particularly high opinion of Trump\n\nExplanation: 'I found him to always be a buffoon. But honestly, and I think unfortunately, a lot of people just thought he was harmless,' said Griffin\n\nPlea: 'Almost every time I've run into this fool, he comes up to me and says, 'Uh, oh, don't be too hard on me. I know you're going to be funny, but you can be tough,'' said Griffin\n\nGriffin was roundly criticized after posting the photo earlier this week, with everyone from former first daughter Chelsea Clinton to her good friend Anderson Cooper publicly stating that the photo and accompanying video was 'appalling' and 'disgusting.'\n\nPresident Trump also spoke out after seeing the photo, as did his son Don Jr., daughter-in-law Lara and the First Lady.\n\nMeanwhile, the harsh words keep coming for Griffin, with Governor Chris Christie of New Jersey the latest to take aim at the entertainer, saying at a news conference on Thursday: 'She's disgusting. And it's completely outrageous. I don't think anybody should hire her again for anything.'\n\nBloom has also been receiving her fair share of negative notes, with the lawyer Tweeting Friday morning: 'To all you sending me hate mail today for my representation of Kathy Griffin, I have this message for you. XO Lisa'\n\nShe then included an image of an affirmation that read: 'The Devil whispered in my ear, 'You're not strong enough to withstand the storm.'\n\n'Today I whispered in the Devil's ear, 'I am the storm.''\n\nThe four Trumps who denounced Griffin all stressed the fact that there are young children in the family who were traumatized by the image.\n\nDon Jr. was the first to speak out, with the oldest Trump child taking to Twitter soon after the image was posted on Tuesday.\n\nHe posted twelve tweets in the span of 24 hours, with many calling for CNN to fire Griffin.\n\n'Dear @CNN, I must have missed your statement banning your commentator #KathyGriffin from future shows. Please resend. Thx,' wrote Don Jr. in one tweet.\n\nHe also responded to tweets from CNN anchors Jake Taper and Cooper after they reprimanded Griffin on the social media site, asking why she still had not been fired and if they would work with the comedian in the future.\n\nThe men did not engage Don Jr., and on Wednesday it was announced that CNN had terminated Griffin from their annual New Year's Eve show.\n\nDon Jr. also brought up his two oldest children, daughter Kai and son Don III in one tweet, writing: 'And I'm counting down having to explain it to my 8 and 10 year olds who I'm sure will see/hear about it at school.'\n\nLoud and proud: 'I got no comment. The thing is, when you make art you go to stand by it,' Shields said while out shopping, hours after Griffin lost her CNN job (pair above in early May)\n\nCommander-in-chief: President Trump tweeted to say the comedian should 'be ashamed of herself'\n\nNonstop: Don Jr. repeatedly called for Griffin to be fired from her job at CNN< which she was on Wednesday\n\nThat was the line President Trump took that same day, writing on Twitter:'Kathy Griffin should be ashamed of herself. My children, especially my 11 year old son, Barron, are having a hard time with this. Sick!'\n\nThe most damning statement however came from the First Lady, who has done her best to stay out of the many controversies that have mired her husband's presidency.\n\n'As a mother, a wife, and a human being, that photo is very disturbing,' said Melania just hours after a report emerged claiming that her son Barron initially thought that his father had been decapitated when he saw the image on TV.\n\n'When you consider some of the atrocities happening in the world today, a photo opportunity like this is simply wrong and makes you wonder about the mental health of the person who did it.'\n\nLara was the last to speak out, and targeted the photographer Tyler Shields.\n\nThe daughter-in-law of President Trump expressed how appalled she was during an appearance on 'Hannity' Wednesday night, before going on to state that Griffin is not the only person who should be getting heat for the incident.\n\n'She has many people around her. There was a photographer involved. I'm sure she has a publicist that works with her,' said Lara.\n\n'There were a lot of people around that could have said, 'You know what, this crosses a line.''\n\nThe publicists who represent Griffin at PMK\xe2\x80\xa2BNC told DailyMail.com that they were not involved in the photo shoot.\n\nLara also said during her Fox News appearance that the family was doing their best to take this latest incident in stride, but struggling in the wake of reports which revealed that Barron was terrified after seeing the image of his father on television.\n\n'I'd love to say that it gets easier. It doesn't get easier, but we can handle it' explained Lara.\n\n'We've taken it for almost two years and we understand that this is the world we live in and we've accepted it, in a way.'\n\n'It tells you the society that we live in today and what some people deem acceptable,' Lara, who is expecting her first child with husband Eric, later said in the interview.\n\n'Had this happened to President Obama, I can only imagine what people would be saying right now.'\n\nShields meanwhile continues to stand by the image.\n\n'I got no comment. The thing is, when you make art you go to stand by it,' Shields said during the exchange outside Gelson's supermarket, which was posted by TMZ.\n\nWhen asked if he would do it again, maybe with another politician, Shield simply said: 'I cant censor myself'\n\nLashing out: Lara Trump (above) criticized Kathy Griffin during an appearance on 'Hannity' Wednesday night\n\nEven former first daughter Chelsea Clinton was quick to express her outrage at Griffin tweeting: 'This is vile and wrong. It is never funny to joke about killing a president\n\nAs for Griffin, Sheilds said he had spoken to his friend and subject and that the two were good in the wake of the photo shoot.\n\nHe then wrapped things up by stating: 'I'm just going to go home and eat my ice cream.'\n\nIn footage of the shoot, Griffin is seen joking that she and Shields will have to flee the country once it gets out.\n\n'We have to move to Mexico today,' she said, 'because we're gonna go to prison. Federal prison.\n\n'Call your dad, apologize, then let's you [and me] go to Mexico because we're not surviving this.'\n\nShe's seen in the footage lifting the grisly 'head' out of a metal bowl, then rotating it towards the camera until it hits a spot that Shields likes.\n\nFinally, at Shields' demand, she drops it to the ground.\n\nIn the video, Griffin also joked: 'Tyler and I are not afraid to do images that make noise. And also he often lights me to the point where I look about 15.\n\n'But first I'm an artist. But really it's good lighting.'\n\nGriffin apologized on Tuesday for posting the video following a furious backlash and a hint at an investigation by Secret Service, which has now been confirmed.\n\nThe controversial entertainer tweeted: 'I am sorry. I went too far. I was wrong.'"""

"b'There\xe2\x80\x99s a reason Kylie Jenner and Travis Scott are rarely seen together, the couple explained in an interview with GQ published on Tuesday. The youngest Kardashian is a natural in front of the cameras, but it\'s \xe2\x80\x9ctorture\xe2\x80\x9d for Scott.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was whispering to me the whole time,\xe2\x80\x9d Jenner said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe just doesn\'t like taking the photos.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nJenner and Scott are new parents to daughter Stormi Webster, who was born February 1. Despite their official status as a family, the pair is usually apart in the spotlight: Where Jenner goes, Scott rarely follows. Jenner said it was a way for the two to preserve their relationship and Scott\'s comfort level.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know he doesn\'t like the attention,"" she said. ""That\'s why we just go the extra mile to keep our relationship super private, or like, if he has events or something, I won\'t come. Because I want him to do his own thing. I want him to be him. I don\'t want it to be Kylie and Trav. If people don\'t ever see us together, that\'s okay with me, because we just do our thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe \xe2\x80\x9cKardashian Curse\xe2\x80\x9d was a topic of conversation for the pair. The curse is said to surround the celebrity attention that follows the Kardashian name, making even the half-sister\xe2\x80\x99s best relationships unsuitable for the spotlight.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\'s exactly what it is,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jenner. \xe2\x80\x9cThey come and can\'t handle it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTheo Wargo/Getty Images for Huffington Post\n\nSee all of the best photos of the week in these slideshows\n\nAs for Scott\xe2\x80\x99s take on the \xe2\x80\x9cKardashian Curse\xe2\x80\x9d?

I don\'t get involved. I\'m over here. Kylie is different.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTo Jenner, the \xe2\x80\x9ccurse\xe2\x80\x9d extends past the Kardashian\'s love interests to anyone who hasn\xe2\x80\x99t fielded criticism the way the family has.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\'s everyone around us that aren\'t used to it. And we\'re just like, \xe2\x80\x98Oh, that\'ll go away in a day.\xe2\x80\x99 I know these stories aren\'t going to matter, so don\'t even let them affect you, you know? I think you\'re correct.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShe added, \xe2\x80\x9cBut it\'s not just men\xe2\x80\x94it\'s friends, it\'s people who come and just don\'t know how to handle it. It\'s the negative. There\'s a lot of people who love us, but there\'s also a huge handful of people who don\'t like us.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nJenner is a leading force in the makeup industry, selling more than $630 million in products in three years, according to Forbes.\n\nScott is a rapper best known for his 2015 album Rodeo and 2017 single Butterfly Effect, which has more than 365 million streams on Spotify.'"

"b'Suri Cruise just turned 12 several months ago but a recent report claims that she has already made up her mind about pursuing an acting career. Meanwhile, rumors that her father, Tom Cruise, is fighting to get custody rights and that she allegedly dislikes Katie Holmes\xe2\x80\x99 new relationship have been debunked.\n\nHollywood Life reported on Wednesday that a \xe2\x80\x9csource close to the [family]\xe2\x80\x9d claimed that the 12-year-old girl started taking acting classes recently. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s caught the acting bug. She\xe2\x80\x99s signed Suri up for one-on-one acting classes with an acting coach and she\xe2\x80\x99s getting private singing and music classes too,\xe2\x80\x9d the insider added.\n\nA post shared by Suri Cruise Holmes ???? (@suricruise.official) on Aug 22, 2018 at 9:32am PDT\n\nAs a daughter of two very popular actors, it should not be difficult for Suri to find inspirations leading to her dream of becoming an actress as well. But Hollywood Life\xe2\x80\x99s source claimed that the young lady started wanting to become an actress when she visited the set of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Kennedys: After Camelot.\xe2\x80\x9d Holmes played the late Jackie Kennedy in the 2017 miniseries.\n\nThe insider stated further that Suri Cruise was fascinated with how the actors prepared for their scenes, especially with their \xe2\x80\x9chair, makeup and wardrobe.\xe2\x80\x9d It is not strange for children of popular actors to follow their parents\xe2\x80\x99 legacy. And the report claimed that Katie Holmes is totally on board with Suri\xe2\x80\x99s dream. However, Tom Cruise reportedly thinks his daughter is still quite young to be starting an acting career.\n\nIn other news, there has been a recent spike in the number of published rumors that Tom Cruise is fighting to get custody of his 12-year-old daughter. The reports also said that the \xe2\x80\x9cMission Impossible\xe2\x80\x9d actor is trying to win back Suri by showering her with gifts aside from his alleged renewed efforts in court.\n\nRecently, it was also reported that Suri Cruise had been \xe2\x80\x9cbegging\xe2\x80\x9d her mom Katie Holmes to ditch her relationship with boyfriend Jamie Foxx. There were recent claims that Suri does not approve of how the singer-actor treats the 39-year-old \xe2\x80\x9cDawson\xe2\x80\x99s Creek\xe2\x80\x9d alum.\n\nA post shared by Suri Cruise Holmes ????

"b""Three duchesses, three very distinct styles.\n\nAt the 2018 Trooping the Colour, Queen Elizabeth II's birthday parade celebration (not to be confused with her actual birthday on April 21), pastels were a plenty among the royals, with the queen, Kate Middleton, Meghan Markle and Camilla Parker Bowles taking part. While the duchesses followed the unofficial color theme, self-expression was clear.\n\nKate wore a long-sleeve dress with a square neckline and an accentuated waist, a very classic look that displayed the small design details she loves, while Meghan wore a structural off-the-shoulder silhouette that featured her more modern style sensibilities.

"b'Jennifer Garner and Lindsay Shookus are not \xe2\x80\x9cboth pregnant\xe2\x80\x9d with Ben Affleck\xe2\x80\x99s babies, contrary to a new tabloid cover story. Garner and Affleck also have not \xe2\x80\x9ccalled off\xe2\x80\x9d their divorce. Gossip Cop can exclusively bust these untruths.\n\nThe latest cover of Star features photos of Garner and Shookus that were taken from side angles, giving the false illusion of protruding stomachs. These misleading pictures are being used to sell an entirely fabricated narrative about Affleck impregnating both women. It\xe2\x80\x99s evident right in the sub-headline inside the issue that this is all bogus, with the magazine writing, \xe2\x80\x9cSources Say Ben Affleck May Be Gearing Up For New Babies \xe2\x80\x94 With Both His Girlfriend And His Ex-Wife!\xe2\x80\x9d Garner is not Affleck\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cex-wife,\xe2\x80\x9d as they are still legally married, and the use of the word \xe2\x80\x9cmay\xe2\x80\x9d indicates the outlet doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have any legitimate confirmation to back up its claims.\n\nIn fact, the publication goes on to contend Affleck \xe2\x80\x9ccould be expecting a child not only with Lindsay \xe2\x80\x94 but also with Jen.\xe2\x80\x9d Notably, neither \xe2\x80\x9cmay\xe2\x80\x9d nor \xe2\x80\x9ccould\xe2\x80\x9d appear on the cover, where it\xe2\x80\x99s declared Shookus and Garner are \xe2\x80\x9cboth pregnant.\xe2\x80\x9d The tabloid lures readers in with what appears to be an announcement, but then changes course in the actual story, which is apparently about the possibility that they\xe2\x80\x99re both carrying the actor\xe2\x80\x99s babies. Following this bait-and-switch, a so-called \xe2\x80\x9csource\xe2\x80\x9d calls the situation a \xe2\x80\x9cmess,\xe2\x80\x9d but asserts \xe2\x80\x9cthe initial shock is wearing off,\xe2\x80\x9d and Affleck is \xe2\x80\x9cactually feeling good about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut how is it not known for sure then whether or not Garner and Shookus are expecting? The logic is faulty throughout the piece. It\xe2\x80\x99s alleged that Affleck possibly impregnated Garner when he supposedly spent the night at her home back on March 7. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s no secret Ben was trying to woo Jen back, even while seeing Lindsay,\xe2\x80\x9d claims the tabloid\xe2\x80\x99s untraceable \xe2\x80\x9cinsider,\xe2\x80\x9d while the unnamed \xe2\x80\x9csource\xe2\x80\x9d theorizes Affleck and Garner \xe2\x80\x9cmay have had a brief magic moment\xe2\x80\x9d during the unverified \xe2\x80\x9csleepover.\xe2\x80\x9d Meanwhile, another anonymous \xe2\x80\x9cinsider\xe2\x80\x9d contends that unidentifiable \xe2\x80\x9cpeople\xe2\x80\x9d are now \xe2\x80\x9cbuzzing she\xe2\x80\x99s pregnant, and that the timing lines perfectly up with the night Ben slept at her place.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAs for Shookus, the magazine asserts she\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9crumored to be pregnant, too,\xe2\x80\x9d with another purported \xe2\x80\x9csource\xe2\x80\x9d alleging there\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ctalk of a baby on the way.\xe2\x80\x9d She and Affleck are said to be \xe2\x80\x9cboth very happy, in spite of the unusual circumstances,\xe2\x80\x9d which is a clear contradiction from the cover line that maintains Shookus\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cbaby joy\xe2\x80\x9d has been \xe2\x80\x9cshattered.\xe2\x80\x9d In another red flag, there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing said in the article about Affleck and Garner calling off their divorce, despite that also being touted on the front of the issue.\n\nGossip Cop also already busted this same outlet a few weeks ago for falsely claiming Shookus is pregnant. As we pointed out then, just days before that tale was published Shookus and Affleck went on a double date with her parents, where she was seen drinking wine. That same weekend, Shookus and Affleck were photographed on a hike with her family, and it was clear from her pictured bared midriff that she does not have any kind of a baby bump. That was on June 24, a week after the misleading June 16 photo of Shookus that Star uses on its cover. Basically, she didn\xe2\x80\x99t have a baby bump and then eight days later it disappeared.\n\nIn regards to the actor reconciling with his estranged wife, People examined the state of Affleck and Garner\xe2\x80\x99s relationship on the one-year anniversary of the divorce filing, and reported that while they co-parent and support one another, he is in a \xe2\x80\x9cvery committed relationship\xe2\x80\x9d with Shookus. That means no dalliances with Garner. Furthermore, Garner just did a YouTube live stream with Martha Stewart this week, and it\xe2\x80\x99s apparent from the video that she, too, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have a baby bump. The photo of Garner on the cover was taken on July 4, a full 12 days before her later flat-stomach appearance with Stewart.\n\nConclusion: More recent photos of Garner and Shookus than the ones used by the tabloid show that neither of them has a baby bump. There is also independent reporting about Shookus drinking wine after the cover picture was taken, and another reputable outlet has reported that Garner and Affleck aren\xe2\x80\x99t involved romantically any more. That rules out pregnancies for both women. In addition to all this transparent evidence, Garner\xe2\x80\x99s spokesperson, who is authorized to speak on her behalf, confirms to Gossip Cop that she is neither pregnant nor having a rendezvous with Affleck. For his part, Affleck\xe2\x80\x99s rep tells us on the record that the double pregnancy cover story is \xe2\x80\x9cso crazy\xe2\x80\x9d and untrue that it\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9camusing almost.\xe2\x80\x9d And a Shookus confidante, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, calls the claims both \xe2\x80\x9chilarious\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cnot true.\xe2\x80\x9d'"

Dating the director was different.

Neither of us are doing it because if I read it, I start getting defensive.\xe2\x80\x99 Especially because it\xe2\x80\x99s my man,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s awesome, what we did \xe2\x80\x94 some people hate it and the people who hate it, really hate it. But it\xe2\x80\x99s nothing that needs to be defended and if I read a negative review, I just feel defensive.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe American Hustle actress and the Black Swan director, 48, first met on the set of the psychological horror film. They sparked dating rumors in September 2016, and two months later they were spotted kissing in New York City. \xe2\x80\x9cThey get along really well,\xe2\x80\x9d a source told Us at the time.\n\nIn September, Lawrence spoke about the director in an interview with Vogue: \xe2\x80\x9cWe had energy.

I\xe2\x80\x99ve been in relationships before where I am just confused.

He also stood next to Oxman in another picture with his hands behind his back as the larger group beamed at the camera. That photo has since been taken down.\n\nPage Six first reported last week that the two had struck up a friendship based on their shared love of architecture.

Oxman spoke out on the issue of male dominance and how it isn\xe2\x80\x99t specific to the architecture field.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor the same reason we have the Brad Pitts and the George Clooneys, it\xe2\x80\x99s just part of human nature to idolize stereotypes,\xe2\x80\x9d she explained. \xe2\x80\x9cSuch singularities are useful to the common perception of heroism.

"b'Justin Theroux and Jennifer Aniston. Photo: Getty Images\n\nWelcome to You Know What I Heard, the Cut\xe2\x80\x99s weekly celebrity gossip column about the peregrinations of the rich and famous. Have gossip? Email me at allie.jones@nymag.com, send me a message on Twitter, or contact me on Signal (ask for the number).\n\nWhen Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux announced their breakup last Thursday evening, they did so with a joint statement issued by Aniston\xe2\x80\x99s longtime publicist, Stephen Huvane. It had Jen written all over it: The statement called out the malicious \xe2\x80\x9cgossip industry\xe2\x80\x9d and insisted that \xe2\x80\x9cwhatever else is printed about us that is not directly from us, is someone else\xe2\x80\x99s fictional narrative.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSince Thursday, a lot has been printed about the split, and a lot of it seems to be coming from Theroux\xe2\x80\x99s friends. So who\xe2\x80\x99s really running this breakup?\n\nSources close to Theroux in New York have been telling \xe2\x80\x9cPage Six\xe2\x80\x9d that Theroux was \xe2\x80\x9creally bored by [Aniston\xe2\x80\x99s] whole Hollywood crowd\xe2\x80\x9d and that he \xe2\x80\x9cinitiated\xe2\x80\x9d the separation. Unfortunately for Aniston, Official Hollywood Bible People has more or less backed up those \xe2\x80\x9cPage Six\xe2\x80\x9d reports, citing sources who say that Theroux was done with the marriage and wanted to take the breakup public ASAP.\n\nIn one report, published Sunday, a source close to Aniston told People that \xe2\x80\x9cJen didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to announce [the split] for as long as possible, because she wanted to avoid the media attention.\xe2\x80\x9d But Theroux didn\xe2\x80\x99t play ball. Instead, he walked around getting photographed in New York throughout Aniston\xe2\x80\x99s birthday weekend, while Aniston celebrated at home with girlfriends in L.A. (We definitely noticed that last week.)\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cJen hoped that Justin would be low-key on her birthday so people weren\xe2\x80\x99t wondering why he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t with her, but that\xe2\x80\x99s not Justin\xe2\x80\x99s style,\xe2\x80\x9d People\xe2\x80\x99s source said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe wanted to make the announcement so he can live his life.\xe2\x80\x9d Theroux apparently flew to L.A. to talk to Aniston three days after her birthday (on Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s Day!), and Aniston agreed to release a statement the next day.\n\nSo: Theroux initiated the breakup and took it public before Aniston was ready because \xe2\x80\xa6 why? What life does he want to live? The Sun reported this weekend that one source of contention in his marriage to Aniston was his desire to \xe2\x80\x9cparty\xe2\x80\x9d with the \xe2\x80\x9cNew York art scene.\xe2\x80\x9d Specifically, Sun sources claimed that Aniston was upset over Theroux\xe2\x80\x99s desire to hang out with 25-year-old photographer and \xe2\x80\x9cart beauty\xe2\x80\x9d Petra Collins.\n\nThe Sun tends to be more accurate when reporting on British stars (like Taylor Swift\xe2\x80\x99s boyfriends), so who knows where its reporters are getting this information, but Theroux and Collins do know each other. Collins shot Theroux for a spread in L\xe2\x80\x99uomo Vogue last year. The shoot took place at Paul\xe2\x80\x99s Baby Grand in Tribeca; you can see it on Collins\xe2\x80\x99s website.\n\nHypothetically, what would a Collins-Theroux romance mean for gossip? Collins isn\xe2\x80\x99t just an indie darling; she\xe2\x80\x99s also a collaborator and close friend of Selena Gomez. Gomez has publicly gushed, many times, about how much she loves Aniston. (They met a few years ago through their management.) Will Gomez have to pick a side?\n\nSelena Gomez and Jennifer Aniston. Photo: Ari Perilstein/Getty Images for Cinelou\n\nAnother curious element in all of this: Aniston and Theroux may not be legally married at all. Though they had a surprise wedding in the back yard of Aniston\xe2\x80\x99s Bel Air mansion in 2015, TMZ reported this weekend that the couple never filed for a marriage license, confidentially or otherwise, in L.A. County. And neither Aniston nor Theroux has hired a divorce lawyer.\n\nTheroux\xe2\x80\x99s friends may be talking to the tabloids, but Theroux himself is not ready to address the rumors: He backed out of a scheduled appearance on The Late Show With Stephen Colbert tonight.\n\nSelena Gomez, meanwhile, is reportedly in Jamaica with Justin Bieber for Bieber\xe2\x80\x99s dad\xe2\x80\x99s wedding. Jeremy Bieber, 42, is marrying his \xe2\x80\x9clongtime girlfriend\xe2\x80\x9d Chelsey Rebelo, 29. Here\xe2\x80\x99s a photo of Gomez posing with some of Rebelo\xe2\x80\x99s friends and relatives:\n\nSo Gomez and Bieber are going strong, despite her family\xe2\x80\x99s disapproval. According to People, the on-again couple spent Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s Day with a visit to Hillsong and a makeout at the Montage in Beverly Hills.\n\nWe haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard much from Ben Affleck and his SNL-producer girlfriend Lindsay Shookus so far this year, but you\xe2\x80\x99ll be happy to know they are still together and still color-coordinating their outfits.\n\nBen Affleck and Lindsay Shookus. Photo: SOVE, GICE/Stoianov/Max - Lopes/Geva / BACK\n\nAccording to E! News, the couple spent Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s Day house-hunting in L.A. \xe2\x80\x9cThey visited two homes in the $8 million\xe2\x80\x93$10 million range with a broker who gave them tours,\xe2\x80\x9d a source told the site. Those homes were in the tony neighborhood of Pacific Palisades, where Affleck\xe2\x80\x99s ex-wife Jennifer Garner lives with their three kids. The house tours were very romantic, apparently.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhile Ben and Lindsay were waiting for the first house to be opened, Ben grabbed Lindsay on the doorstep and pulled her in close for a hug,\xe2\x80\x9d E!\xe2\x80\x99s source said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey were swaying back and forth hugging and laughing. He kissed her on the forehead. He walked with his arm around her and put his hand on her lower back. They seemed very happy and close.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShookus can\xe2\x80\x99t be planning to move to L.A. full-time, though, can she? Her daughter and ex-husband live in New York. And she has SNL. Currently, she\xe2\x80\x99s living in Affleck\xe2\x80\x99s $28,000-a-month rental on the Upper West Side.\n\nOne small blessing from this week:\n\nHere is a photo of Rooney Mara and her boyfriend Joaquin Phoenix going to a mall in Sherman Oaks.\n\nJoaquin Phoenix and Rooney Mara.

Photo: Tristan Fewings/Getty Images\n\nFinally, I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave you with this TimesTalk Jennifer Lawrence did last week to promote her new spy thriller Red Sparrow. During the talk, she said she\xe2\x80\x99d like to use her character\xe2\x80\x99s skills to figure out \xe2\x80\x9cwhat\xe2\x80\x99s going on with Karlie Kloss and Taylor Swift.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the God\xe2\x80\x99s honest truth,\xe2\x80\x9d she added. \xe2\x80\x9c[It\xe2\x80\x99s] keeping me up at night.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLove or hate J.Law, she is a great gossip. Most celebrities pretend not to pay attention to the tabloids, but she regularly brings up feuds and rumors in public conversations. (See this appearance on Andy Cohen\xe2\x80\x99s Watch What Happens Live! or her interview with Kim Kardashian West on Jimmy Kimmel\xe2\x80\x99s show.) I, too, would love to know why Kloss and Swift broke up. This past weekend, Kloss attended the NBA All-Star Game with her boyfriend Josh Kushner. Before that, she was spotted hanging out with sworn-Swift-enemy Katy Perry. Swift has been hanging out with herself. Will J.Law\xe2\x80\x99s comment prompt Swift to make a statement?\n\nThanks so much for gossiping this week. Don\xe2\x80\x99t forget to email me at allie.jones@nymag.com, send me a message on Twitter, or contact me on Signal, if you\xe2\x80\x99d like to chat.'"
"b'We\xe2\x80\x99re still crying over the fact that Zayn Malik and Gigi Hadid\xe2\x80\x99s pillow talk has come to an end, but we\xe2\x80\x99ve learned there\xe2\x80\x99s hope for a reconciliation!\n\n\n\nWhen celeb couples are this cute, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to let them go \xe2\x80\x94 which is why we\xe2\x80\x99ve got our fingers crossed there\xe2\x80\x99s more in store for Zayn Malik and Gigi Hadid. \xe2\x80\x9c[They] just lost the romance with each other and wanted to try to be alone. They are going to use this time to see if they should continue to be broken up or get back together down the line. There is still a chance if they end up missing each other. So there is still hope, but they definitely need time away [from each other],\xe2\x80\x9d a source close to the couple tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY, following the couple\xe2\x80\x99s confirmation of their breakup on March 13.\n\nAfter rumors ran rampant earlier this morning, Zayn, 25, and Gigi, 22, released separate statements on social media, confirming the heartbreaking split after over two years of dating. Zayn tweeted, \xe2\x80\x9cGigi and I had an incredibly meaningful, loving and fun relationship and I have a huge amount of respect and adoration for Gigi as a woman and a friend. She has such an incredible soul. I\xe2\x80\x99m grateful to all of our fans for respecting this difficult decision and our privacy at this time, we wish this news could have come from us first. We love you all. xZ.\xe2\x80\x9d And Gigi added, \xe2\x80\x9cBreakup statements often seem impersonal because there is really no way to put into words what two people experience together over a few year..not only in the relationship, but in life in general. I\xe2\x80\x99m forever grateful for the love, time, and life lessons that Z and I shared. I want nothing but the best for him and will continue to support him as a friend that I have immense respect and love for. As for the future, whatever\xe2\x80\x99s meant to be will alway be.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThis sad breakup confirmation comes after a report by The Sun started going viral. If you\xe2\x80\x99ll recall, Zayn and Gigi started dating in November 2015 \xe2\x80\x94 just three months after he ended his engagement to Little Mix\xe2\x80\x98s Perrie Edwards, 24. Their relationship also started just weeks after Gigi broke up with Joe Jonas, 28, which was seen as controversial at the time. We\xe2\x80\x99re sad to see any couple part ways, but at least there\xe2\x80\x99s hope for a reunion down the line! Whatever makes each of them happy, we\xe2\x80\x99ll fully support.'"

"b'As Life & Style exclusively reported, Kylie Jenner secretly married Travis Scott in a small ceremony at her Calabasas mansion \xe2\x80\x94 but most of the 19-year-old\xe2\x80\x99s famous family didn\xe2\x80\x99t even know about it!\n\nAn insider reveals that the beauty mogul was scared about how her mom and siblings would react to the news. \xe2\x80\x9cKendall [Jenner] is the only family member Kylie told.

"b'Britney Spears isn\xe2\x80\x99t afraid to gush! So on February 5, she took to Instagram and Twitter for a shoutout to her boyfriend, Sam Asghari. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been with this man for over a year\xe2\x80\xa6 everyday (sic) he inspires me to be a better person and that makes me feel like the luckiest girl in the world!!\xe2\x80\x9d she wrote on a #relationshipgoals snap of the couple in front of a waterfall.\n\nWhat would make her feel even luckier \xe2\x80\x94 an insider reveals in the new issue of Us Weekly \xe2\x80\x94 is having a baby with her beau. \xe2\x80\x9cBritney has talked with Sam about having babies together,\xe2\x80\x9d says the insider. \xe2\x80\x9cShe was young when she had Sean and Jayden, and she feels much more mature now.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe \xe2\x80\x9cPiece of Me\xe2\x80\x9d songstress first became a mom in 2005 when she welcomed son Sean Preston, now 12, with then-husband Kevin Federline. She had Sean\xe2\x80\x99s brother, Jayden, almost exactly a year later.\n\nSpears, 36, met Iranian fitness model Asghari, 23, on the set of her steamy \xe2\x80\x9cSlumber Party\xe2\x80\x9d video in 2016. And \xe2\x80\x9cthe attraction was immediate,\xe2\x80\x9d says the insider. \xe2\x80\x9cThey had intense chemistry.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAt first, no one on her team \xe2\x80\x94 least of all the chart topper \xe2\x80\x94 thought the union would last. \xe2\x80\x9cShe wasn\xe2\x80\x99t looking for a relationship.

"b'Gwen Stefani Finding the Inspiration to have Another Baby from Janet Jackson!! Is the Story true? Find out what Gossip Cop has to say about it! Share this\n\nThe latest news over social media is Janet Jackson Inspiring Gwen Stefani to have another baby! But is the news really true or is it just another wrong information?\n\nLet\xe2\x80\x99s Find out!\n\nJanet Jackson inspiration of new Baby for Gwen Stefani\n\nRecently Janet Jackson has shown the world that having a baby later in life is possible, and her experience has served as hope to many people. Among those feeling inspired is Gwen Stefani.\n\nHollywoodLife.com reported recently that the 47-year-old singer is considering becoming a mother again after knowing that Janet gave birth at 50 years old. Though her three sons, Kingston, 10, Zuma, 8, and Apollo, 3, do keep her plenty busy, the star would love to make her boyfriend, Blake Shelton, a dad.\n\nThe inside source said:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGwen would love to have another child with Blake. He\xe2\x80\x99s not pressuring her at all, but she knows it\xe2\x80\x99s something he would love too.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe source continued:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe isn\xe2\x80\x99t focused on it obsessively, but seeing Janet Jackson have a healthy baby at 50 has inspired her to open her mind more to the possibility. It\xe2\x80\x99s made her start to see it as something she and Blake really could make happen.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut the story is not true.\n\nYou may like to read Gavin Rossdale happy but also concerned that his children with his ex-wife Gwen Stefani are more time with her boyfriend Blake Shelton!\n\nThe truth of the Story\n\nAccording to Gossip Cop, the news is just a rumor and it is a False Report. Also about Hollywoodlife, Gossip Cop has found the truth and here it is.\n\nHollywoodLife, which has been caught on numerous occasions for concocting untrue articles, is at it again. This time around the often discredited site stated that Jackson, as a \xe2\x80\x9clate-in-life mom, has \xe2\x80\x9cinspired\xe2\x80\x9d Stefani to have one more child with Shelton.\n\nThe webloid first regurgitates such readily available information as Jackson was 50 when she gave birth to her baby boy Eissa, and that Stefani is currently 47 years old.\n\nIt then follows that up with a seemingly made-up quote that alleges that Stefani\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cisn\xe2\x80\x99t focused on it obsessively, but seeing Janet Jackson have a healthy baby at 50 has inspired her to open her mind more to the possibility.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWell, this is \xe2\x80\x9cmore than a possibility\xe2\x80\x9d: The site either relied on yet another unreliable \xe2\x80\x9cinsider\xe2\x80\x9d or simply made up this fake news story on its own.\n\nJust a few days ago, the webloid alleged that Stefani and Shelton fight constantly over him wanting alone time. It was a big lie and was busted by Gossip Cop.\n\nAs Gossip Cop accurately reported, Stefani and Shelton did not split up.\n\nA number of equally untrustworthy sites that picked up its fabricated claim, Gossip Cop can stop this fake news story in its tracks.\n\nWhether she one day decides and is able to have a fourth child, it will have nothing to do with Jackson. Plenty of other regular women, as well as those in the entertainment industry, have had kids later in life.\n\nAlso read Gwen Stefani And Her Boyfriend Blake Shelton Celebrated Her Son Apollo\xe2\x80\x99s 6th Birthday Together!\n\nShort Bio on Janet Jackson and Gwen Stefani\n\nJanet Jackson is an American singer, songwriter, dancer, and actress. She is known for sonically innovative, socially conscious, and sexually provocative records, elaborate stage shows, and high-profile television and film roles, she has been a prominent figure in popular culture for over 30 years.\n\nIn addition to recognition for the innovation in her records, choreography, music videos, and prominence on radio airplay & MTV, she was acknowledged as a role model for her socially conscious lyrics.\n\nIn 1991, Jackson signed the first of 2 record-breaking multimillion-dollar contracts with Virgin Records, establishing her as one of the highest-paid artists in the industry.\n\nJackson is one of the best-selling artists in the history of contemporary music. One of the world\xe2\x80\x99s most awarded artists, her longevity, records, and achievements reflect her influence in shaping and redefining the scope of popular music.

"b""The diaper bag I use for my toddler ran about $70. To me, that was a pretty hefty price to pay. Then Kim Kardashian revealed how much Saint's diaper bag costs. I don't think I could complain about dropping $70 on anything in my life again. Kardashian's diaper bag for Saint reportedly costs $23,000, Us Weekly reported, citing a blog post the celebrity mom wrote Thursday.\n\nThe diaper bag in question is a Herm\xc3\xa8s Birkin purse, which usually cost thousands of dollars, according to ABC. (The most expensive Birkin handbag sold for $379,261 in June.) So it shouldn't be a surprise that Kardashian is carrying around a $23,000 diaper bag for her 20-month-old son. I won't lie, though: I choked on my water when I saw that price tag.\n\nIn a post for her official app, Kardashian explained more about the origin of Saint's diaper bag,\n\nBut the thing is, it\xe2\x80\x99s a really old bag. It was my first Birkin bag that I ever bought. ... But that\xe2\x80\x99s all they had and I just wanted one so badly and I\xe2\x80\x99d saved and saved and that\xe2\x80\x99s all they had and I took it. When I got pregnant I was like, \xe2\x80\x98perfect! I\xe2\x80\x99ll use it as a diaper bag.\xe2\x80\x99\n\nThis isn't the first time Kardashian used a diaper bag with a price tag in the five-digit range. According to the Hollywood Life, the 36-year-old entrepreneur used a $30,000 Herm\xc3\xa8s Birkin handbag to carry around diapers, snacks, and wipes when daughter North West was only a few months old in 2013.\n\nStill, for many of us, $23,000 is a shocking price. After all, that's how much I spend on nearly two year's worth of rent. It's a huge chunk of change most of us won't have the chance to hold in our hands for even a second. Of course, I'm not judging Kardashian for dropping that kind of money; she has it to spend, obviously, and spend she should. And it seems her Herm\xc3\xa8s Birkin bag will stand the test of time and weather, which is more than I could say for mine.\n\nIn fact, as US Weekly pointed out, Kardashian could probably use the Herm\xc3\xa8s Birkin diaper bag when she and Kayne West have their third child next year via surrogacy. (Kardashian has been quite public about her high-risk pregnancy complications and desire to have more children.) The powerhouse couple have reportedly recently chosen a surrogate, a mom from San Diego in her late 20s. They're expecting to welcome their newest addition in January 2018, according to reports."""
"b'Angelina Jolie may have been visiting Target, but this doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that buying at the store has become her \xe2\x80\x9csecret shopping fix.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRumor debunking site, Gossip Cop, recently countered the statements made by National Enquirer about the \xe2\x80\x9cMaleficent\xe2\x80\x9d actress.\n\nThe tabloid quoted an unnamed source who said, \xe2\x80\x9cSuperstar Angelina Jolie is wealthy enough to shop anywhere, but when it came to the holidays, she was all about bargains. Angie loves Target. It\xe2\x80\x99s one of her favorite stores, and it\xe2\x80\x99s where she buys lots of Christmas gifts. Walking around with her shopping cart makes her feel happy.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nGossip Cop stressed that there\xe2\x80\x99s no truth to such claims, and reiterated that it all started after Radar Online published a story about Jolie struggling with her finances. The tabloid claimed that Jolie has opted to buy discounted items at Target because of her money problems.\n\nHowever, there\xe2\x80\x99s also no truth to such rumors because the actress\xe2\x80\x99 net worth is roughly around $160 million. She has just completed a series of successful projects, namely, \xe2\x80\x9cFirst They Killed My Father\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cThe Breadwinner,\xe2\x80\x9d which generated huge sums of money.\n\nMeanwhile, Jolie was also spotted at Target with her two kids, Shiloh, and Vivienne in August. The trio wanted to buy food at the store, but immediately left Target after they learned that it was no longer available.\n\nGossip Cop also stressed the fact that there\xe2\x80\x99s no truth to the claims made by the sister sites because even their statements contradicted each other. Last week, Radar Online quoted their source, \xe2\x80\x9cWalking around with her shopping cart makes her feel normal again.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNational Enquirer, on the other hand, wrote, \xe2\x80\x9cWalking around with her shopping cart makes her feel happy.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut regardless of where Jolie wants to shop, the most important thing is that she gets to spend time with her six children. The single mom has joint custody of her kids with Brad Pitt. The actor only has visitation rights to see their children, but all six of them are living with Jolie under one roof.'"

"b'Update, 4/6, 7:40 a.m.: It turns out The Sun\'s report truly is just a wild rumor with no truth to it. Gossip Cop reports that an insider close to Swift confirmed she is not house-searching in England at all\xe2\x80\x94especially as she\'s about to set off on her Reputation world tour this spring.\n\nOriginal, 4/5, 5:35 p.m.: Taylor Swift, the pop star and very secretive girlfriend of British actor Joe Alwyn, is ready to commit! To England full-time, that is. The Sun\'s Dan Wootton\xe2\x80\x94the guy who broke the news the two were secretly dating last May\xe2\x80\x94reports that Swift is looking for a North London house to make her home base. Alwyn and his family live in North London\'s Crouch End; Swift would like to be near that and the countryside near Soho Farmhouse in Oxfordshire, outside of the city. (Soho Farmhouse, by the way, is where Meghan Markle had her swanky bridal shower.)\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTaylor loves the UK and how she can live a relatively normal life without being disturbed,"" the source said. The Sun previously reported that Swift went undetected in disguises around the city. \xe2\x80\x9cSetting down roots is something she\xe2\x80\x99s thought long and hard about. She\xe2\x80\x99s set aside \xc2\xa330 million ($42 million) to find the house of her dreams, which she hopes to one day settle down in with Joe if their relationship continues to grow.""\n\n\n\nThe leading requirement for this house is that it has multiple kitchens. \xe2\x80\x9cTwo mega kitchens are an absolute requirement as she wants one near her entertaining area to be kept clean,"" the source continued. This is because Swift loves cooking oh-so much. Her passion for it is so intense, Alwyn reportedly calls her his ""feeder,"" per The Sun.\n\nThis isn\'t Swift\'s only property, of course. Swift has a penthouse apartment in New York City, a Beverly Hills house that\'s also a historic landmark, the Rhode Island beach house where she throws her Fourth of July parties, and a penthouse apartment in Nashville (plus a house there, too).\n\nPreviously, Swift rented a home in London, then started staying at Alwyn\'s so much that his friends joked ""it\xe2\x80\x99s as if she\xe2\x80\x99s moved in with him,"" a source told The Sun earlier this year.\n\nAlyssa Bailey News and Strategy Editor Alyssa Bailey is the news and strategy editor at ELLE.com, where she oversees coverage of celebrities and royals (particularly Meghan Markle and Kate Middleton).\n\nThis content is created and maintained by a third party, and imported onto this page to help users provide their email addresses.

JAY explained: \xe2\x80\x9cIn the long relationship, you know, hopefully when we\xe2\x80\x99re 89 we look at this six months or whatever time and we laugh at that. You know what I\xe2\x80\x99m saying? There\xe2\x80\x99s gonna be complications in the relationship that we have to get through.

He claimed their kids didn\xe2\x80\x99t play together, and he revealed that there was tension between him and JAY because of a TIDAL music dispute. Ye\xe2\x80\x99 even said that JAY and Beyonce didn\xe2\x80\x99t even call after Kim\xe2\x80\x99s 2016 Paris robbery.

"b'It\xe2\x80\x99s no secret that Ian Somerhalder and Nina Dobrev were in a relationship during the early years on The Vampire Diaries. Somerhalder played Damon Salvatore while Dobrev played Elena Gilbert. They were two of the main characters and worked closely together. As with many leading men and women who are significant others on a TV show, feelings can sometimes grow between them. Often, relationships outside the show become just as official. Some couples barely last beyond the boyfriend/girlfriend stage, but some - like Anna Paquin and Stephen Moyer from True Blood - get married.\n\nSomerhalder and Dobrev tried to remain covert as a couple, often denying rumors they were dating, or speaking obscurely when questions or statements veered towards their suspected relationship. W ith a Hollywood lifestyle, the truth eventually surfaced. The couple dated for 3 years from 2010 to 2013 before ending their relationship to much controversy and speculation - mostly from The Vampire Diaries fan community and the tabloids.\n\nWhile they had secrets during their relationship, not all of them were bad. Some were downright fun, some were friendly, and some involved people (and animals!) outside their relationship. This list lets you know some of those secrets back when they were dating, soon after their breakup, and up until today.\n\nHere\xe2\x80\x99s 15 Secrets Behind Nina Dobrev and Ian Somerhalder\xe2\x80\x99s Relationship.\n\n15 Ian\'s Test\n\nMost men and women have things they look for when dating or courting someone of the opposite gender. Call them requirements or criteria, but consciously or subconsciously, men and women pay attention to them. In the November 2012 issue of Self magazine, Nina Dobrev told readers and her fans what she required of Ian Somerhalder before they officially became a couple.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has to be a happy person,\xe2\x80\x9d she said is her relationship requirement. Did he make her happy? He sure did: \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll laugh and enjoy life more,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. Because Somerhalder is a happy person, she credits him with being one way to deal with any stress in her life. Does Dobrev have other ways? Yes: yoga and chocolate.\n\nIn a previous interview for Seventeen magazine she had more detail in what she meant. \xe2\x80\x9cI think people should be with the person who makes them smile.\xe2\x80\x9d She states that you shouldn\'t be in that relationship if you don\xe2\x80\x99t smile anymore. Dobrev praises that it\xe2\x80\x99s okay to have good and bad experiences with dating because you\xe2\x80\x99ll find out what you do and don\xe2\x80\x99t like in a person. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s part of growing up and learning,\xe2\x80\x9d she added. \xe2\x80\x9cYou should always be with the people who make you feel happiest.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n14 Nina Didn\'t Want To Date Co-Stars\n\nBefore The Vampire Diaries, Nina Dobrev had been in a number of television films and had been in a total of 52 episodes of Degrassi: The Next Generation. Already a young star, Dobrev was doing interviews for major teen magazines like Seventeen. She was on the cover the first time in 2010 with the main blurb reading ""Nina: Why she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t date any of her co-stars."" Dobrev had said that it \xe2\x80\x9ccould definitely get sticky if you dated your co-star.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShe also stated she didn\xe2\x80\x99t need a boyfriend to be happy, but would be with someone if she met them and wanted to be with him. Although she has no problem being single, she would devote her time and love to the person who she became extremely crazy about. Except it can\xe2\x80\x99t be too much work: \xe2\x80\x9cOnce it\xe2\x80\x99s not fun anymore, it\xe2\x80\x99s not worth it,\xe2\x80\x9d she told the magazine.\n\nDobrev wanted to be professional on the show, but then two years later, when she did another interview for Seventeen magazine, she was dating Somerhalder.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSometimes you can\'t help who you have a connection with,\xe2\x80\x9d she told Seventeen. She fought her feelings for Ian for a \xe2\x80\x9creally, really long time.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n13 Nina Kept The Cat After the Breakup\n\nWhile they were dating, Dobrev and Somerhalder were \xe2\x80\x9cparents\xe2\x80\x9d to a cat named Moke. After they broke up, it appeared that Dobrev retained \xe2\x80\x9ccustody\xe2\x80\x9d of the feline because she continued to post photos of her and the cat together.\n\nIn April 2013, the couple had to rush Moke to the animal hospital because the cat became suddenly ill. Eventually, Moke became better.\n\nTwo months later, Dobrev was getting ready for a trip when her \xe2\x80\x9ckid\xe2\x80\x9d hopped in the suitcase. Apparently, the cat didn\xe2\x80\x99t want her to leave. \xe2\x80\x9cI think he wants me to bring him too\xe2\x80\xa6 Won\xe2\x80\x99t leave the suitcase!\xe2\x80\x9d she tweeted. In another tweet, she posted a photo with \xe2\x80\x9cKid is helping me pack\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d It\xe2\x80\x99s understandable Dobrev would keep the cat; she had always said Ian is a nice guy, so it stands to reason he would let her keep Moke.\n\nHowever, it\xe2\x80\x99s very possibly Somerhalder comes to visit Moke since he considered himself a \xe2\x80\x9cparent.\xe2\x80\x9d Then again, she may have been taking care of Moke while Ian was away filming a movie at the time, The Anomaly. With the tweets about Moke in the suitcase, she never revealed where she was going, so she may have been returning Moke to Somerhalder. Or it could have been his weekend to have the cat, like in a traditional parenting agreement in a divorce.\n\n12 How Nina and Ian Were Cast\n\nIt was Nina Dobrev\xe2\x80\x99s casting first which helped the creators pick the two other main actors for Stefan and Damon Salvatore. On one of the bonus features for the DVD set, Dobrev said it was a long process, but she ultimately received the role of Elena Gilbert, despite not having blonde hair. The creators were more concerned with the actress than physical features. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was a sacrifice we had to make,\xe2\x80\x9d Julie Plec, a showrunner said.\n\nFor a while, the creators and executive producers couldn\xe2\x80\x99t find actors that had chemistry with Dobrev.\n\nThey especially had trouble find someone to play Damon. Then they found out Ian Somerhalder was interested. Somerhalder stated it was 7-10 days of meetings, interviews, and auditions. He really wanted the role and seemed to impress everyone. \xe2\x80\x9cWe were convinced he was our guy,\xe2\x80\x9d Plec said.\n\nAs soon as it was announced Somerhalder was cast as Damon, everyone had an opinion about the choice. Luckily, the press and fans knew that Somerhalder was perfect to play opposite Dobrev. Even Plec said that she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t think of anyone else in that part. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is just so good,\xe2\x80\x9d she also said. And for three years, Dobrev and Somerhalder were good together in real life too.\n\n11 Nina and Ian Are ""Hippies""\n\nIn 2012, for an interview with US Weekly, Kat Graham called Ian Somerhalder and Nina Dobrev ""hippies"" when commenting on their relationship. Graham was Somerhalder and Dobrev\xe2\x80\x99s co-star in The Vampire Diaries; she played Bonnie Bennett in the CW series. Graham didn\xe2\x80\x99t call the couple hippies to be mean - she meant it as a very positive way to look at the relationship.\n\nSomerhalder and Dobrev are \xe2\x80\x9cgenuinely good people who strive toward having a good relationship,\xe2\x80\x9d Graham had said. If that is what being a hipping means when dating, then everyone should strive to be a hippie with a significant other.\n\nDuring their 3 years as a couple, Somerhalder and Dobrev appeared to make everything work as best they could, especially since they were constantly in the spotlight. In an interview with the same magazine in 2011, Somerhalder said what he loved the most about Dobrev: \xe2\x80\x9cShe truly enjoys life. Her desire to experience and appreciate everything around her, and chuckle and enjoy it, is great.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIn a later interview with People magazine, Graham also called the couple \xe2\x80\x9cperfect\xe2\x80\x9d because they have \xe2\x80\x9cthe same values when it comes to people [and] how you treat people.\xe2\x80\x9d She added that they are perfect because of how they treat animals, the world, and the environment.\n\n10 Ian As Christian Grey\n\nWhen the 50 Shades of Grey movie was announced and casting begin, Ian Somerhalder was believed to be in the running. During interviews, he gave vague answers to questions about joining the cast of the movie. In the after-show Watch What Happens Live hosted by Andy Cohen, Somerhalder told Cohen, \xe2\x80\x9cThere are so many young boys in Hollywood up for this role.\xe2\x80\x9d He added, \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t say anything other than it\xe2\x80\x99s a very interesting story, and whoever plays that role is going to have a lot of fun.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMore interesting is his answer to who he would have play opposite him as Anastasia. During an interview with Ryan Seacrest on his show On Air with Ryan Seacrest, Somerhalder told Ryan, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to think about that.\xe2\x80\x9d Seacrest mentioned there could be \xe2\x80\x9cramifications\xe2\x80\x9d to any answer Somerhalder gives, and the host put words in Somerhalder\'s mouth, saying \xe2\x80\x9cBecause I would like to have a happy home.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAll this meant was Ian didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to say who he\xe2\x80\x99d really like to play Anastasia because Dobrev could possibly get jealous or angry.\n\nTo keep the peace in their relationship, Somerhalder thought it better to just preserve any answers. Seacrest subtly mentioned Somerhalder should text him the answer, so he may know the truth.\n\n9 Were They Dating? Not Dating?\n\nIt took a long time for fans and viewers and websites to figure out Nina Dobrev and Ian Somerhalder were dating. But before that for months (almost a year), the proof piled up in the form of pictures of them spending time and attending events together.\n\nThe first time people wondered if they were together was in Australia, where a photograph surfaced of the two snorkeling together. They also were spotted at the Daintree Rainforest and Great Barrier Reef.\n\nThe two showed additional romantic behavior when they were in an Atlanta restaurant for Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s day. He tweeted the holiday was \xe2\x80\x9ccorporate\xe2\x80\x9d and a \xe2\x80\x9cconspiracy of florists and chocolatiers,\xe2\x80\x9d but also said the \xe2\x80\x9cday serves as a good excuse to spread a little love.\xe2\x80\x9d Right after Dobrev denied dating rumors, she and Somerhalder were spotted at Coachella Music Festival looking as if they were in a relationship. There was another incident where Dobrev and Somerhalder were out one night, and she wore a black derby hat Somerhalder had worn just days before. A friendly gesture or not?\n\nThe moment that the couple became subtly official occurred at the 2011 MuchMusic Awards. They arrived together and were caught giving each other a quick kiss behind the scenes. Also, Dobrev was the person Somerhalder mentioned he was most excited to see that night.\n\n8 The Paris Trip\n\nIf there was one point in Dobrev and Somerhalder\xe2\x80\x99s relationship that told everyone they were definitely dating, it was the trip they took together to Paris in 2012. For years, the two rebuked and deflected questions and statements about their dating status. Even before the Paris trip, with sightings at various locations overseas and in the United States, fans and the media just assumed they were together.\n\nThe reason for the trip varied from personal vacations - they weren\xe2\x80\x99t set to film the 4th season of The Vampire Diaries until the fall of that year - to going out with co-stars. On the Saturday they were in Paris, they joined in Julie Plec\xe2\x80\x99s birthday party. Plec is one of the creators of TVD.\n\nAlthough they were spotted apart - usually dodging the hordes of fans who came to see them walk around Paris - Dobrev and Somerhalder were photographed quite often strolling through the streets showing all types of affection.\n\nFrom holding hands to snuggling to intimate and caring touching, the two clearly had the hots for each other.\n\nThis trip was slightly different than the one before it, when the couple brought their mothers, early in their relationship. Of course, they claimed not to have been dating around that time.\n\n7 Nina Helps Still Helps Ian With Puppies After Their Breakup\n\nMonths after Somerhalder and Dobrev ended their relationship, Somerhalder started dating other women and Dobrev was with Derek Hough of Dancing with the Stars. But when Ian\xe2\x80\x99s dog went into labor, Nina was right there to help Ian.\n\nOne day in August 2013, Ian saw a dog trapped in traffic nearby The Vampire Diaries\xe2\x80\x99 sound stages. Ian rescued the dog and ultimately adopted her, but what he didn\xe2\x80\x99t know at the time was the dog - who Ian named Nietzche - was pregnant. He did use the dog\xe2\x80\x99s pregnancy as an opportunity to promote his Ian Somerhalder Foundation, which seeks to end over-population of animals by completing research of \xe2\x80\x9cspecies-specific sterilization drugs.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNina was present during Nietzche\xe2\x80\x99s labor and supported Ian and his dog-daughter the through whole birthing process. She posted a Whosay picture of the dog and new puppies. She wrote, \xe2\x80\x9cBirthing little Nietzsches \xe2\x80\xa6Such a beautiful + equally terrifying thing to witness. The miracle of life :) #Wow.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nJust another piece of evidence that Nina and Ian remained good friends after their breakup, just months after the end occurred. If an ex-girlfriend was that mad at you after a split, would she come to help you deliver newborn puppies?\n\n6 They vacationed with their mothers\n\nThe burning question for a long time was \xe2\x80\x9cAre Nina Dobrev and Ian Somerhalder dating?\xe2\x80\x9d If a previous entry in this list didn\xe2\x80\x99t provide the evidence at the time to answer that query, then this one might. Dobrev and Somerhalder\xe2\x80\x99s Paris trip was a defining moment in their relationship to outsiders and fans of the actor and actress, but what they did on the trip wasn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly telling for everyone.\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s an important step when dating to introduce your significant other to your family and your parents - specifically, your mother.\n\nIt must have been serious when Dobrev and Somerhalder brought their mothers along for the ride. Whether or Dobrev and Somerhalder had met each others\xe2\x80\x99 mothers before the trip probably didn\xe2\x80\x99t matter, because all four were spotted out for a shopping stroll in Paris together. The couple sometimes walked a few steps ahead, giving their mothers some time to chat.\n\nIf you wanted additional proof that Dobrev and Somerhalder were a couple, bringing their mothers on the trip further validates the speculation (one of the more positive rumors about them) that they had been dating. It was a simple vacation, but one that further inflamed fans\xe2\x80\x99 hopes about the two together.\n\n5 Ian Had Hard Time Dating After Nina\n\nBreakups are rough. The longer you date or are with someone, the rougher the breakup will be. P ost-breakup life can be even harder, especially when you try to get back into the dating life, if that\xe2\x80\x99s something you plan to do. Ian Somerhalder found out that dating after Nina Dobrev was a hard time.\n\nHe told the German magazine Bravo, \xe2\x80\x9cI would be happy if a woman would just go to dinner with me, rather than wanting my babies right away!\xe2\x80\x9d While Somerhalder had reportedly wanted to settle down with Dobrev, she wanted to commit to her career. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s just too young,\xe2\x80\x9d an insider informed In Touch Weekly. Nina wasn\xe2\x80\x99t ready to take the relationship to the next level.\n\nNow Somerhalder was back on the market, looking to move on from his 3-year relationship with Dobrev. In the interview with Bravo, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t clear who he was going to dinner with; if they were blind dates, other actresses, or women he met while out and about. However, what was clear was that Somerhalder had been traveling between the U.K. and the U.S. filming the movie The Anomaly and getting set for the new season of The Vampire Diaries respectively, so finding a woman to consistently date would be hard enough traveling so much.\n\n4 Post-Breakup Goals\n\nThere were many rumors and stories about Dobrev and Somerhalder\xe2\x80\x99s breakup. Most of them were negative, often spearing the friendship the two had even after they split. It was likely hard enough to be seen together (or not together) in public, but it was probably harder for both of them to endure the rumors and the speculations that ran rampant around the internet.\n\nNo matter how you saw the couple after breaking up, many clues surfaced about their good friendship after dating. Besides, they still had to work together!\n\nThe couple instructed everyone to have breakup goals since, between them, there was no reason either one should hate each other. Dobrev has a personal philosophy that says, \xe2\x80\x9cI try to be good to everyone, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s a love, a friend, an ex. I\xe2\x80\x99ll always try to treat people the way I want to be treated.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nDespite those nasty rumors, Dobrev and Somerhalder have proved that two people can move on from a romantic relationship and remain good friends - at least as long as animals are involved! Whatever happened when they were dating, their friendship was strong enough to maintain after the breakup. Their friendship possibly became stronger after splitting up!\n\n3 Cheating Rumors\n\nAfter the breakup, rumors and theories swirled that Somerhalder had cheated on Dobrev with Nikki Reed when they were still together. Celebrity Dirty Laundry claimed that \xe2\x80\x9cEverybody connected to the situation claimed that Ian had cheated on Nina."" This was reportedly because Dobrev didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to \xe2\x80\x9csettle down\xe2\x80\x9d and she didn\xe2\x80\x99t think their \xe2\x80\x9crelationship was going anywhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut the two women - Nikki Reed and Nina Dobrev - let everyone know years later that they were never jealous of each other or fought over Ian Somerhalder. They dispelled the rumors that they hated each other, and that Reed broke the \xe2\x80\x9cgirl-code\xe2\x80\x9d by dating Somerhalder. Dobrev started off addressing the speculations by posting a picture of her at The Vampire Diaries series finale dinner with Reed and Somerhalder. She wrote, \xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t believe how time flies. Farewell dinner with team Somereed! So good catching up with these goofballs!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s hard to know what to believe with sites that run rumors and speculation and spew them as truth, but when the actual truth comes from the people involved, and you can see without a doubt they are being sincere, it\xe2\x80\x99s easy to believe them. After Dobrev posted the dinner picture, Reed took to Instagram for a similar follow-up.\n\n2 The Somerhalder Love Triangle\n\nIan Somerhalder married Nikki Reed in April of 2015. They are currently still married and had a daughter in July of 2017. It was about a year after breaking up with Dobrev that Somerhalder started dating Reed. Somerhalder and Reed were engaged in February 2015.\n\nDespite the obvious adoration Somerhalder felt for Reed, rumors that he was back with Dobrev or was cheating on Reed with Dobrev continued for a time after the marriage.\n\nThe Christian Post claimed Ian and Nikki weren\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x9chaving a great time together\xe2\x80\x9d since the wedding. A separation rumor after Somerhalder was ready to have kids with Reed, but she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t ready. The actress wanted to focus on her career, continuing to build it on her terms. Somerhalder infamously threw out Reed\'s birth control.\n\nThis, and the fact Dobrev was probably coming back to The Vampire Diaries at the time, sparked rumors that Somerhalder had fled back to the arms of Dobrev. It didn\xe2\x80\x99t help that fans were upset when Dobrev left the show (many thought it was because of their breakup) and were equally upset when Somerhalder announced his relationship with Nikki. Fans wanted Dobrev and Somerhalder together, so it was easy to create the drama that Somerhalder went back to Dobrev at the slightest mention of trouble in Somerhalder\xe2\x80\x99s marriage.\n\n1 Nina is friends with Ian\'s wife\n\nIn February 2017, Nikki Reed went to Instagram and posted a photo and rant about Somerhalder, Dobrev, and herself. In the photo, Reed is surrounded by her husband and Somerhalder to prove that the three are close friends, and have been for several years. The post has over half a million likes, but it\xe2\x80\x99s the accompanying text that is the reason for the post itself.\n\nWhile rumors swirled about the hatred between Reed and Somerhalder, the two girls and Ian have stayed silent on the subject. Reed states she thought \xe2\x80\x9caddressing any baseless rumors with silence was the best way.\xe2\x80\x9d Reed didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to respond to the stories about friends backstabbing friends, cheating, or fake reasons cast members left The Vampire Diaries. She called out \xe2\x80\x9clow-brow\xe2\x80\x9d websites that \xe2\x80\x9cperpetuated trends.\xe2\x80\x9d Being silent, according to her, was an easy way for more \xe2\x80\x9cfalsities, and juicer stories.\xe2\x80\x9d Reed used the Instagram platform to put an end to all the \xe2\x80\x9cfake stories of on-set jealous, betrayal\xe2\x80\xa6and women hating women.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe main purpose of the post was to empower young girls to \xe2\x80\x9cend that narrative.\xe2\x80\x9d She wanted the headlines taking advantage of a fan\xe2\x80\x99s devotion of a show to stop since those headlines teach hate. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\xa6hopefully we will start to see a shift in the way we treat each other & view ourselves,\xe2\x80\x9d she ended the post.\n\n---\n\nDo you have any other trivia to share about Ian Somerhalder and Nina Dobrev\'s relationship?

"b'Another day, another celebrity rumor to debunk.\n\nThe Twittersphere was having a field day this week after word started spreading that Gigi Hadid and Zayn Malik were supposedly having a baby. Yep, you read that right. The whole thing got started when an Instagram comment allegedly written by Gigi\'s mother, Yolanda Hadid, began making the rounds on social media. The comment in question said: ""I will be a proud grandma in eight months. Life is a blessing.""\n\nAs it turns out, it seems like that comment might have been the work of Photoshop, since the real Yolanda Hadid took to Twitter last night to clear everything up \xe2\x80\x94 and she made a pretty good point in the process. ""No of course not,"" Yolanda wrote in response to a fan who asked if the rumor was true. ""If my daughter was pregnant, she would be the one to announce it not me,"" she added. We want to give her a high five for that explanation because she\'s 100% right \xe2\x80\x94 in a hypothetical scenario where Gigi is pregnant, it would be her news to share, not anyone else\'s.\n\nNevertheless, this hasn\'t stopped fans from speculating on Twitter and discussing the rumor at length. But this situation is a good reminder that we shouldn\'t believe everything we see on the Internet, even if it seems like a legit screenshot from social media. Images can be altered, and sometimes Photoshop is very convincing. Ultimately, we need to listen to the stars themselves, and in this case, it seems like Yolanda made herself pretty clear. Perhaps we can put this particular rumor to rest now; after all, there\'s sure to be another one tomorrow.\n\nRelated: Fans Found Gigi Hadid\xe2\x80\x99s Secret Twin and They\xe2\x80\x99re FREAKING OUT\n\nCheck this out:'"

"b'It\xe2\x80\x99s been more than three years since Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner announced their decision to separate after 10 years of marriage.\n\nThough the two have not been romantically involved since then, they have remained very much a part of each other\xe2\x80\x99s lives, co-parenting their three children \xe2\x80\x94 Violet, 12, Seraphina, 9, and Sam, 6 \xe2\x80\x94 together and often attending church and going on vacations as a family.\n\nThen on Wednesday, Garner was spotted driving her ex to a rehab facility.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBen\xe2\x80\x99s priorities remain his family and his sobriety,\xe2\x80\x9d a source told ET. \xe2\x80\x9cHe continues to attend meetings and mediation classes for his well-being. You have to work at your sobriety every day and he does that.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSince their separation in 2015, the exes have not officially divorced. While Garner, 46, has remained fiercely private and protective of her family, she has, on occasion, spoken about Affleck and their children.\n\nHere\xe2\x80\x99s everything she\xe2\x80\x99s said about Affleck since their split:\n\nJuly 2018\n\nGarner opened up about the pressures of public life on her marriage and her family during a CBS Sunday Morning interview, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cLooking back on that, I really feel the stress of it. I really \xe2\x80\x94 I could cry talking about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShe added, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve learned is that the scrutiny in your private life puts a pressure to make something happen. You feel a pressure to hurry up and get married, \xe2\x80\x98cause you think that\xe2\x80\x99ll end the, \xe2\x80\x98Are they engaged? Are they not?\xe2\x80\x99 And that\xe2\x80\x99s true in reverse, as well. If you are \xe2\x80\x94 if there is any inkling of trouble, or if the tabloids decide there\xe2\x80\x99s trouble, it can create trouble. But to be honest, public scrutiny, everyone says, \xe2\x80\x98Oh, you\xe2\x80\x99ve had to go through this in public.\xe2\x80\x99 The public isn\xe2\x80\x99t what\xe2\x80\x99s hard. What\xe2\x80\x99s hard is going through it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nJune 2018\n\nFor Father\xe2\x80\x99s Day, Garner penned a rare and touching tribute to Affleck on Instagram, writing, \xe2\x80\x9cOur kids are lucky to have a dad who looks at them the way you look at them and loves them the way you love them, @benaffleck. #happyfathersday #threeluckykids #haveagreatday.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nStory continues\n\nNovember 2017\n\nIn an interview with news.com.au, Garner talked about being separated from the father of her children, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cI would not have chosen this life for myself or for my kids. I would not choose to be single or be in this position. It\xe2\x80\x99s something that we are working through.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMay 2017\n\nAfter People magazine released a cover story about Garner\xe2\x80\x99s new life as a single mom, Garner took to Facebook to set the record straight.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis isn\xe2\x80\x99t a tragedy by any measure, but it does affect me and my family and so, before my mom\xe2\x80\x99s garden club lights up her phone, I wanted to set the record straight,"" she said. ""I did not pose for this cover. I did not participate in or authorize this article. While we are here, for what it\xe2\x80\x99s worth: I have three wonderful kids and my family is complete.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nOctober 2016\n\nGarner spoke with ET\xe2\x80\x99s Denny Directo at the Save the Children Illumination Gala about how she and Affleck have chosen to raise their kids.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s so important that you model for your kids how to be a citizen of the world, and I think that\xe2\x80\x99s the best thing you can do,\xe2\x80\x9d she told ET, adding that she and Affleck each have special causes that they try to teach their kids about.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s really important at home, to make sure that our kids know that we both have causes that we care so much about\xe2\x80\xa6 that we dedicate time, resources, and our energy toward making our own little slice of the world a little bit better,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\n\nAugust 2016\n\n\'We are definitely a modern family\': #JenniferGarner talks to @nmoralesnbc about family and marriage https://t.co/jJpZAE5BoG \xe2\x80\x94 TODAY (@TODAYshow) August 4, 2016\n\nGarner was praised on the Today show for putting her kids first while dealing with the end of her marriage.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt has to be,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. ""You don\xe2\x80\x99t have a choice. It has to be.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nCalling their family unit \xe2\x80\x9cdefinitely a modern family,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re doing really well.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShe also opened up about her decision to take her kids to London for the filming of Justice League, in which Affleck played Batman.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBen was working on Justice League, and I thought, \xe2\x80\x98Well, the kids should have that experience,\'\xe2\x80\x9d she explained. \xe2\x80\x9cHe and I are great friends, and we just all went en masse.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nFebruary 2016\n\nVanity Fair\n\nOpening up for the first time since the couple announced their split in June 2015, Garner told her side of the story in a Vanity Fair cover piece. She had both kind and honest words for her estranged husband in the article.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was a real marriage,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt wasn\xe2\x80\x99t for the cameras. And It was a huge priority for me to stay in it. And that didn\xe2\x80\x99t work.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShe added that she\xe2\x80\x99d do it all over again, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t marry the big fat movie star; I married him. And I would go back and remake that decision. He\xe2\x80\x99s the love of my life. What am I going to do about that?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAs for Affleck\xe2\x80\x99s personality, Garner admitted, \xe2\x80\x9cI always say, \xe2\x80\x98When his sun shines on you, you feel it.\xe2\x80\x99 But when the sun is shining elsewhere, it\xe2\x80\x99s cold. He can cast quite a shadow.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nOf their bond, she admitted, \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s still the only person who really knows the truth about things. And I\xe2\x80\x99m still the only person that knows some of his truths.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWhen it comes to the public\xe2\x80\x99s response to Affleck, she noted, \xe2\x80\x9cNo one needs to hate [Ben] for me. I don\xe2\x80\x99t hate him. Certainly we don\xe2\x80\x99t have to beat the guy up. Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry \xe2\x80\x94 my eyes were wide open during the marriage.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHere\'s more on Garner and Affleck:\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\nInside What Led to Ben Affleck\'s Return to Rehab (Exclusive)\n\nJennifer Garner Takes Ben Affleck Back to Rehab After His Struggles With Sobriety\n\nJennifer Garner Doesn\'t Want to \'Police\' Who Ben Affleck Dates Amid Romance With Playboy Model (Exclusive)\n\nRelated Articles:'"
"b'Julia Roberts is not forcing her husband Danny Moder to go on the same detox diet that she supposedly follows, despite a made-up report. Gossip Cop can exclusively debunk this story. We\'re told there\'s no truth to it.\n\nGetty Images\n\n""Pretty Flabby Woman? Julia\'s Detox Diet Driving Danny Moder Mad,"" reads a new RadarOnline headline. The accompanying article says Roberts is trying to lose weight after portraying a frumpy mom in the upcoming drama Ben Is Back, but she\'s also making her husband eat the same healthy foods as her.\n\nA supposed source tells the site, ""She\'s demanding they eat only \'colorful\' fruits and veggies, raw nuts and seeds\xe2\x80\xa6 No meat, no dairy, no sugar, no processed stuff."" The alleged insider further contends that Roberts acts like ""a crazed hungry person"" and gets ""irritable"" whenever she\'s dieting, which leads to fights between the actress and her husband.\n\nThe suspicious tipster also claims that Moder will sometimes attempt ""to sneak out for a snack,"" but ""Julia actually smells his breath when he gets back."" The unreliable blog ends its piece by randomly recycling old rumors about the cinematographer because jealous of his wife\'s ""reconnection with former Pretty Woman co-star Richard Gere,"" which isn\'t the case.\n\nBut Gossip Cop checked in with a source close to the situation, who exclusively assures us that Roberts isn\'t on any sort of ""detox diet,"" nor is she concerned about her weight. In fact, photos from the set of Ben Is Back show that the actress isn\'t the least bit ""flabby,"" despite the blog\'s mean assertion otherwise.\n\nAlso, Roberts has revealed in the past what she eats during a typical day, and her meals don\'t consist of what\'s listed above. The actress acknowledges she stays healthy by eating lots of protein and vegetables, but also admitted, ""I love a good cookie!"" Roberts further noted that she\'ll often indulge in pasta dishes.\n\nUnfortunately, we\'re not surprised by RadarOnline\'s bogus story, considering that the site frequently alleges that Roberts and Moder are having marriage problems. Gossip Cop previously called out the website for wrongly reporting that the actress was caught kissing a ""mystery man"" at a restaurant. The so-called ""mystery man"" was actually Roberts\' longtime agent, Richard Lovett, and there was nothing remotely romantic about their smooch. This latest article surrounding a ""detox diet"" is more lies.\n\nMore on Gossip Cop:\n\nJennifer Aniston and Brad Pitt are NOT getting married again despite report\n\nFergie\'s national anthem is NOT a result of drug relapse despite report\n\nIs Tiffany Haddish dating Lamar Odom?'"

"b'With less than a week until Prince Harry weds Meghan Markle, Lifetime adapted the couple\'s love story into a film aptly titled Harry & Meghan: A Royal Romance.\n\nAiring last night, the movie depicted the relationship timeline of Harry and Meghan\xe2\x80\x94from the factual public moments and milestones to the probably less accurate (and more dramatic) behind-the-scenes love story. While the movie did include real life events from Meghan and Harry\'s relationship (including their first blind date and whisking away to Botswana), there were also some...ahem...harder-to-believe plot-lines thrown in as well.\n\nThough the film\'s stars, Parisa Fitz-Henley [Meghan] and Murray Fraser [Harry], resembled their real-life counterparts pretty well, there were several scenes that you can bet almost certainly didn\'t occur\xe2\x80\x94no matter how accurate the cast\'s resemblance was.\n\nBelow, we\'re breaking down the dramatic, very Lifetime-y moments of the movie that probably, absolutely, most definitely did not happen in real life.\n\n1) Harry and Meghan almost got attacked by a lion in Africa.\n\nOn a trip to Botswana around the 20th anniversary of Princess Diana\'s death, the couple is dramatically confronted by an angry lion when they run outside in the middle of the night after a fight. The near-death experience, of course, causes them to make up immediately. Honestly, I can\'t believe this whole scene isn\'t already a Taylor Swift song.\n\n2) Meghan tried to break up with Harry via FaceTime, only to have him surprise her on set of Suits at the SAME exact moment.\n\nOkay, first of all, you honestly can\'t expect me to believe that this woman tried to break up with AN ACTUAL PRINCE via FaceTime. That\'s just not how this game works. On top of that, the moment she decides to end things with him is the same moment he\'s knocking on the door of her Suits trailer for a surprise visit to Toronto? I\'m going to need the receipts on this one.\n\n3) Meghan breaks up with Harry A SECOND TIME before dramatically running to stop his plane from taking off when she comes to her senses.\n\nIT\'S ALL TEW MUCH. NOBODY BREAKS UP WITH A PRINCE THIS MANY TIMES. Spoiler alert: she of course gets to his plane on time and is somehow miraculously able to stop the private royal jet from taking off. All that was missing from this scene was a thunderstorm moment filmed in the pouring rain.\n\nThis content is imported from Twitter. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.\n\n4) The couple dressed up as a frog and Hillary Clinton for a Halloween party...\n\nWhile the two were secretly dating, Harry dressed up in a frog suit (get it, the frog becomes Prince Charming?) to go ""in disguise"" at a Halloween party. Meghan, meanwhile, dressed as Hillary Clinton (because all feminists must be HRC for Halloween), making for the most awkward couples costume of all time. While it\'s unclear if the Soho House party in question actually occurred, I\'m giving Harry and Meghan the benefit of the doubt that they would choose better costumes if said party did go down.\n\nLifetime\n\n5) Kate Middleton\'s intense criticism and attitude toward Meghan Markle.\n\nFor whatever reason, Lifetime decided to portray the Duchess of Cambridge as a super snooty and cold character with plenty of criticism to dish out for Meghan. When William first tells Kate that Harry\'s dating an American girl (he actually reveals this by saying Harry ""Botswana-ed"" Meghan, a term that I\'m willing to bet is not in William\'s vocabulary), Kate\'s response is, ""Oh no, they\'re so loud.""\n\nThis content is imported from Twitter. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.\n\nWhile I\'d be willing to overlook that slightly shady dig, later in the movie Kate tells Harry, ""If she\xe2\x80\x99s your girl, she can\xe2\x80\x99t have opinions"" before adding, ""She\xe2\x80\x99s divorced, she\xe2\x80\x99s American, she\xe2\x80\x99s half-black\xe2\x80\xa6.are you ready for this? Think of what we went through because I was a commoner.""\n\nUm, I\'m calling BS\xe2\x80\x94I find it VERY hard to believe this was an exchange that ever took place. In fact, Kate and Meghan are reportedly pretty close now and have appeared at public events together alongside Prince William and Prince Harry. I\'m sensing there was never any bad blood here...\n\nGetty Images\n\nWhat I would be here for, however, is a sequel movie depicting the friendship between Kate and Meghan following the royal wedding next weekend.

"b'At an intimate show in his hometown of Tishomingo, Oklahoma, February 9, Blake Shelton offered the crowd plenty of their favorites \xe2\x80\x94 including his girlfriend, Gwen Stefani. \xe2\x80\x9cGwen sat in the stands and was grooving along,\xe2\x80\x9d a concert-goer says in the new issue of Us Weekly. \xe2\x80\x9cBlake sang a lot in her direction.\xe2\x80\x9d At one point, he even shared a sweet detail of their home life, says the witness: \xe2\x80\x9cTheir dog was having puppies and they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t wait to get home!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nFor now, those furry family members are serving as surrogates of sorts. \xe2\x80\x9cBlake and Gwen have decided to put plans to have a baby on hold,\xe2\x80\x9d an insider shares in the new issue. \xe2\x80\x9cTheir feeling is if it happens naturally, great. But they\xe2\x80\x99ve decided to not focus on it for the time being.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nStefani, 48, and Shelton, 41, have been trying to conceive for over a year, the source reveals. But the one blessing of their struggle is that it\xe2\x80\x99s made them stronger than ever. The source says Shelton is \xe2\x80\x9cabsolutely devoted\xe2\x80\x9d to Gwen\xe2\x80\x99s sons, Kingston, 11, Zuma, 9, and Apollo, 4: \xe2\x80\x9cBlake is extremely attentive, loving and doting towards Gwen and the boys.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShelton\xe2\x80\x99s devotion is part of what made the couple try for a child together. \xe2\x80\x9cBlake has always wanted children,\xe2\x80\x9d explains a friend. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd he\xe2\x80\x99s great with Gwen\xe2\x80\x99s kids, which prompted them wanting their own.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe No Doubt singer was all in \xe2\x80\x94 but not anymore. \xe2\x80\x9cNot because of a change in her love for Blake,\xe2\x80\x9d explains the source, \xe2\x80\x9cbut because she feels as if it might not be meant to be.\xe2\x80\x9d The country star is on board with her thoughts. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is completely at peace with the prospect of not having any biological children of his own,\xe2\x80\x9d shares the insider.\n\nWith no baby, they\xe2\x80\x99ve also put their wedding plans on hold.

In fact, it\xe2\x80\x99s SUPER NICE. Yes the Little Mix singer thought the Netflix series was \xe2\x80\x9cmassively disturbing,\xe2\x80\x9d but she meant it in a positive, empowering way. And besides, aren\xe2\x80\x99t the greatest works of art the ones that make us feel and think? \xe2\x80\x9cThe way they got the message across was amazing, and although I found it massively disturbing, I feel like every person going to school should watch it.\xe2\x80\x9d See \xe2\x80\x94 Perrie totally loved it!\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing too, since 13 Reasons Why is basically Selena\xe2\x80\x99s baby. The \xe2\x80\x9cHands To Myself\xe2\x80\x9d hitmaker took time away from her singing career to produce the series, which probably was a little frightening at least, but the results totally paid off.

"b""There have been a number of rumors over the years about Tom Cruise\xe2\x80\x99s love life. The Mission Impossible star has kept sort of a low profile with his relationships after splitting from his ex-wife, Katie Holmes, in 2012. Therefore, because he isn\xe2\x80\x99t jumping on couches and declaring his love for anyone, some tabloids have decided to make up stories about him being romantically involved with other Hollywood A-listers.\n\nNow, it\xe2\x80\x99s time to separate fact from fiction and bust those rumors about who Cruise has dated.\n\nAngelina Jolie\n\nIn March 2017, the National Enquirer published a bogus report that the actor was dating Angelina Jolie.\n\nThe publication claimed that the two stars met to talk about the film they were working on together, however, we know that they never did a movie together so that part isn\xe2\x80\x99t true. The outlet went on to claim that Jolie was enjoying making her ex, Brad Pitt, jealous about the romance. But Gossip Cop reported that there\xe2\x80\x99s no truth to that, which makes sense since Jolie told People that dating is the furthest thing from her mind and something she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t plan on doing for a long time.\n\nJane Fonda\n\nAfter appearing together at Comic-Con in Las Vegas in spring 2018 to promote their movies, the site New Idea falsely reported that Cruise was seeing Jane Fonda.\n\nThe Book Club star ended up debunking this rumor herself during an interview with Extra when she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not dating anymore, but I did up until a couple of years ago \xe2\x80\xa6 I\xe2\x80\x99ve closed up shop down there!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nVanessa Kirby\n\nThere were wild reports, which surfaced in October 2017, that The Crown actress Vanessa Kirby was marrying, yes marrying, her Mission Impossible \xe2\x80\x94 Fallout co-star.\n\nThe story was published by not one, but two tabloids and totally caught Kirby by surprise. \xe2\x80\x9cThe most disconcerting thing was the people I didn\xe2\x80\x99t think would believe it did, and they were texting my boyfriend, asking, \xe2\x80\x98Are you OK?'\xe2\x80\x9d she told Marie Claire. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think they believe anything they read now because you just can\xe2\x80\x99t. None of it is real. To be getting married to him? Not even a snog\xe2\x80\x94it was marriage.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nElisabeth Moss\n\nIn November 2017, another article from the National Enquirer was debunked after it claimed that Cruise was romancing Elisabeth Moss. There was no evidence whatsoever to support this story and it may only have come out because the two Scientologists were both single at the time.\n\nMoss though made it clear that to Marie Claire that the report was false and said she has \xe2\x80\x9cno time for dating,\xe2\x80\x9d adding, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s actually a problem. But I\xe2\x80\x99m very focused on my work.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nKatie Holmes\n\nFinally, in November 2016, the website called Headlines & Global News did a story that Cruise\xe2\x80\x99s former wife had dumped her beau, Jamie Foxx, to get back together with him.\n\nOf course, time has proven that to be untrue and despite not wanting to talk about their relationship Holmes and Foxx are still going strong.

Lindsey Graham and Bill Cassidy\'s Obamacare repeal bill, issued Sept. 22, 2017.\n\nAs I have repeatedly stressed, health care reform legislation ought to be the product of regular order in the Senate. Committees of jurisdiction should mark up legislation with input from all committee members, and send their bill to the floor for debate and amendment. That is the only way we might achieve bipartisan consensus on lasting reform, without which a policy that affects one-fifth of our economy and every single American family will be subject to reversal with every change of administration and congressional majority.\n\nI would consider supporting legislation similar to that offered by my friends Senators Graham and Cassidy were it the product of extensive hearings, debate and amendment.

If we do so, our success could be as short-lived as theirs when the political winds shift, as they regularly do. The issue is too important, and too many lives are at risk, for us to leave the American people guessing from one election to the next whether and how they will acquire health insurance. A bill of this impact requires a bipartisan approach.\n\nSenators Alexander and Murray have been negotiating in good faith to fix some of the problems with Obamacare. But I fear that the prospect of one last attempt at a strictly Republican bill has left the impression that their efforts cannot succeed. I hope they will resume their work should this last attempt at a partisan solution fail.\n\nI cannot in good conscience vote for the Graham-Cassidy proposal. I believe we could do better working together, Republicans and Democrats, and have not yet really tried. Nor could I support it without knowing how much it will cost, how it will effect insurance premiums, and how many people will be helped or hurt by it. Without a full CBO score, which won\'t be available by the end of the month, we won\'t have reliable answers to any of those questions.\n\nI take no pleasure in announcing my opposition. Far from it. The bill\'s authors are my dear friends, and I think the world of them. I know they are acting consistently with their beliefs and sense of what is best for the country. So am I.\n\nI hope that in the months ahead, we can join with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to arrive at a compromise solution that is acceptable to most of us, and serves the interests of Americans as best we can.'"

News has learned exclusively.\n\nOn Tuesday, it was revealed that the 39-year-old Keeping Up With the Kardashians star and her 25-year-old model beau called it quits after almost two years together.\n\n""Scott is very happy Kourtney cut it off with Younes. Although he is happy in his relationship with Sofia, he never liked Younes for Kourtney,"" a source told E!

It is his longest relationship since his breakup with Kourtney three years ago.\n\n""Scott and Kourtney are in a cordial place right now. Scott is always resistant to rock the boat with Kourtney,"" the source said. ""He truly will always care about her as wants her to be happy. Everything is always better for the kids\' sake, when they are in a good place.""\n\nKourtney and Scott, who share three children, were together for nine years before they split in July 2015. Kourtney and Younes started dating in late 2016. Their relationship was Kourtney\'s longest since her breakup from Scott.\n\n""In the beginning, Scott was making fun of Kourtney for dating someone so young and saying it would never last,"" another source told E! News. ""Once he got with Sofia, he couldn\'t say anything about Younes. It gave him a lot of perspective and understanding that age is just a number. It was hard for him to see Kourtney dating and he was looking for any reason to not like Younes. But since being with Sofia, he has moved on. Scott cares a lot less than he used to. Of course, Kourtney has a very special place in his heart and always will. He wants Kourtney to be happy.""'"
"b'The reality of Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez\'s break becoming a permanent breakup may be sinking in for the Biebs, or so People\'s new report suggests. A source close to Bieber told the outlet that despite all the Baskin Champion romance talk, Justin Bieber just wants to have Gomez back with him\xe2\x80\x94at church, the ice rink, and beyond. \xe2\x80\x9cHe loves her.

They spent 6 out of 7 consecutive days together that week, indicating they were stronger than ever and might make their on-off relationship permanently on this time, according to the tabloids.\n\nBut Gomez\'s family never approved of the Biebs, a major factor that led to their break, some outlets reported. And Bieber, according to Us Weekly\'s source, started acting selfish again, annoying Gomez. \xe2\x80\x9c[He] doesn\xe2\x80\x99t care about anyone but himself,"" the source told Us on March 12. ""The second she saw it, she walked away, especially now with her health. She knows she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t need him.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe break seemed to be instigated by Gomez right around Bieber\'s March 1 birthday. Bieber never wanted this: ""Justin has been upset about the recent break from Selena and is trying to keep busy until they work things out,"" a source told E! on March 21. ""It wasn\'t his choice for them to split, and he is really taking time to focus on himself right now.""\n\nMeanwhile, Gomez had a realization, E! reported on March 26: that he may be better, but they may still not be right... at least right now. ""Selena realized even though he\'s made some positive improvements, they just aren\'t a perfect match right now,"" a source told the outlet.\n\nBut Gomez\'s birthday post to Bieber remains on her Instagram, a sign that hope may not be lost yet.\n\nThis content is imported from {embed-name}.

"b'Angelina Jolie filed for divorce from Brad Pitt in 2016, but the divorce proceedings still have not been finalized. Consequently, when Jennifer Aniston became single again after separating from Justin Theroux, Jolie reportedly had a shocking influence on Brad\xe2\x80\x99s feelings for Jennifer. As a result, Aniston has turned to her ex-boyfriend, Scottish actor Gerard Butler, an insider told the Express.\n\nGerard Butler Comes Through For Jennifer Aniston\n\nButler and Aniston reportedly stayed close after they dated for about a year. Jennifer and Gerard worked together on the 2010 film The Bounty Hunter. Although Gerard and Jennifer have been talking to each other constantly, don\xe2\x80\x99t look for Aniston to \xe2\x80\x9crush headlong into a new romance right away,\xe2\x80\x9d a friend of Aniston told the Express. However, Jennifer appreciates Butler\xe2\x80\x99s return to her life at this time of heartbreak, according to the pal.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c[Jennifer Aniston is] really touched Gerard is doing everything he can to console her. When she\xe2\x80\x99s ready, there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt he\xe2\x80\x99ll be at her side.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut for fans who have been hoping that the Friends actress and Brad would rekindle their romance, the bombshell about Butler\xe2\x80\x99s return to Aniston\xe2\x80\x99s life is disappointing. Now that Pitt and Aniston are both single, why aren\xe2\x80\x99t they ready to mingle together once more? Jennifer\xe2\x80\x99s friend had a shocking answer to that question.\n\nAngelina Jolie, Jennifer Aniston \xe2\x80\x98Bad Blood\xe2\x80\x99 Causes Brad Pitt To Steer Clear\n\nFor the many fans hoping that Jennifer and Brad will reunite and even remarry after her split from Justin Theroux, the friend pointed to Angelina Jolie as the reason for Pitt to back off.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c[Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston are] never going to happen and there are six little reasons why: Brad\xe2\x80\x99s children with Angelina Jolie.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nJennifer and Angelina allegedly have \xe2\x80\x9cso much bad blood between them\xe2\x80\x9d that Pitt didn\xe2\x80\x99t dare to reunite with Aniston, according to the insider. Jolie and Pitt have six children: Maddox, Pax, Zahara, Vivienne, Knox, and Shiloh Jolie-Pitt.\n\nAt this point in the custody and divorce proceedings, Brad reportedly is worried about Angelina\xe2\x80\x99s reaction. Jolie and Aniston allegedly are feuding, causing Pitt to fear that Angelina \xe2\x80\x9cwould hit the roof\xe2\x80\x9d if he became romantically involved with Jennifer. Aniston\xe2\x80\x99s friend claimed that the situation could make the divorce proceedings \xe2\x80\x9cextremely difficult.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAlthough some reports have claimed that Pitt already introduced some of his kids to Jennifer when Aniston dropped by for a visit, the insider denied it. Instead, the source said that Brad is steering clear of Jennifer because he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want Jolie to think \xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x99d so much as introduced the kids to Jen during a visit.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBrad Pitt\xe2\x80\x99s Love For Kids Trumps Feelings For Jennifer Aniston\n\nAs the Inquisitr reported, Brad Pitt reportedly had a shocking response when he learned about Jennifer Aniston\xe2\x80\x99s split from Justin Theroux. Even though Pitt empathizes with Aniston\xe2\x80\x99s heartbreak as a result of her split from Justin, Brad reportedly dislikes the publicity that has resulted. Pitt also reportedly is worried about the increased spotlight that would result if he and Jennifer rekindled their romance.\n\nJennifer\xe2\x80\x99s friend told the Express that Brad wants to protect his children and that love has caused him to steer clear of Aniston.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBrad loves his children dearly and he\xe2\x80\x99s not going to let anyone come between them if doing so would create custody problems and expose them to negative and invasive publicity.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWhile it\xe2\x80\x99s therefore not likely that Pitt and Aniston will reunite at this point in their lives, Gerard Butler has increased his support for Jennifer, according to the insider. Never married, Butler has been involved in an on-again, off-again relationship with an interior designer, Morgan Brown, for about three years.\n\nGerard once revealed that he feels Jennifer Aniston is a \xe2\x80\x9cmuch better\xe2\x80\x9d on-screen kisser than Angelina Jolie. Jen\xe2\x80\x99s friend told the Express that it\xe2\x80\x99s not a coincidence that Gerard has been supporting Jennifer, hinting that he knew her marriage was falling apart long before she and Justin Theroux announced their split.\n\nJennifer and Justin reportedly chose her 49th birthday to split. But a source told the newspaper that to those on the inside, it has been \xe2\x80\x9cvery obvious\xe2\x80\x9d that their marriage was over. Jennifer and Justin \xe2\x80\x9cled almost completely separate lives,\xe2\x80\x9d added the insider. Theroux was primarily based in New York, while Aniston reportedly preferred their California mansion. That put thousands of miles between the two, causing them to grow \xe2\x80\x9ccompletely apart,\xe2\x80\x9d said the source.'"
"b""There have been a number of rumors over the years about Tom Cruise\xe2\x80\x99s love life. The Mission Impossible star has kept sort of a low profile with his relationships after splitting from his ex-wife, Katie Holmes, in 2012. Therefore, because he isn\xe2\x80\x99t jumping on couches and declaring his love for anyone, some tabloids have decided to make up stories about him being romantically involved with other Hollywood A-listers.\n\nNow, it\xe2\x80\x99s time to separate fact from fiction and bust those rumors about who Cruise has dated.\n\nAngelina Jolie\n\nIn March 2017, the National Enquirer published a bogus report that the actor was dating Angelina Jolie.\n\nThe publication claimed that the two stars met to talk about the film they were working on together, however, we know that they never did a movie together so that part isn\xe2\x80\x99t true. The outlet went on to claim that Jolie was enjoying making her ex, Brad Pitt, jealous about the romance. But Gossip Cop reported that there\xe2\x80\x99s no truth to that, which makes sense since Jolie told People that dating is the furthest thing from her mind and something she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t plan on doing for a long time.\n\nJane Fonda\n\nAfter appearing together at Comic-Con in Las Vegas in spring 2018 to promote their movies, the site New Idea falsely reported that Cruise was seeing Jane Fonda.\n\nThe Book Club star ended up debunking this rumor herself during an interview with Extra when she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not dating anymore, but I did up until a couple of years ago \xe2\x80\xa6 I\xe2\x80\x99ve closed up shop down there!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nVanessa Kirby\n\nThere were wild reports, which surfaced in October 2017, that The Crown actress Vanessa Kirby was marrying, yes marrying, her Mission Impossible \xe2\x80\x94 Fallout co-star.\n\nThe story was published by not one, but two tabloids and totally caught Kirby by surprise. \xe2\x80\x9cThe most disconcerting thing was the people I didn\xe2\x80\x99t think would believe it did, and they were texting my boyfriend, asking, \xe2\x80\x98Are you OK?'\xe2\x80\x9d she told Marie Claire. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think they believe anything they read now because you just can\xe2\x80\x99t. None of it is real. To be getting married to him? Not even a snog\xe2\x80\x94it was marriage.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nElisabeth Moss\n\nIn November 2017, another article from the National Enquirer was debunked after it claimed that Cruise was romancing Elisabeth Moss. There was no evidence whatsoever to support this story and it may only have come out because the two Scientologists were both single at the time.\n\nMoss though made it clear that to Marie Claire that the report was false and said she has \xe2\x80\x9cno time for dating,\xe2\x80\x9d adding, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s actually a problem. But I\xe2\x80\x99m very focused on my work.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nKatie Holmes\n\nFinally, in November 2016, the website called Headlines & Global News did a story that Cruise\xe2\x80\x99s former wife had dumped her beau, Jamie Foxx, to get back together with him.\n\nOf course, time has proven that to be untrue and despite not wanting to talk about their relationship Holmes and Foxx are still going strong. Whenever split rumors do make the rounds, they just leave it to their reps to deny."""

"b'More than a month has passed since Matt Lauer was fired from the Today show, and his former longtime colleague, Katie Couric, is now opening up about the former NBC anchor\xe2\x80\x99s shocking dismissal.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe whole thing has been very painful for me,\xe2\x80\x9d Couric, 61, tells PEOPLE. \xe2\x80\x9cThe accounts I\xe2\x80\x99ve read and heard have been disturbing, distressing and disorienting and it\xe2\x80\x99s completely unacceptable that any woman at the Today show experienced this kind of treatment.\n\nGet push notifications with news, features and more.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had no idea this was going on during my tenure or after I left,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued. \xe2\x80\x9cI think I speak for many of my former colleagues when I say this was not the Matt we knew. Matt was a kind and generous colleague who treated me with respect. In fact, a joke I once made on late-night television was just that, because it was completely contrary to our brother-sister relationship. It\xe2\x80\x99s still very upsetting. I really admire the way Savannah [Guthrie] and Hoda [Kotb] and the entire Today show staff have handled a very difficult situation.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe late-night show joke that Couric refers to is when she said on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen in 2012 that Lauer \xe2\x80\x9cpinches me on the ass a lot.\xe2\x80\x9d A clip of the comment made the rounds online in the wake of Lauer\xe2\x80\x99s firing.\n\nCouric spent 15 years co-hosting NBC\xe2\x80\x99s Today show with Lauer, 60, but left in May 2006 to anchor the CBS Evening News.\n\nImage zoom Credit: NBC/Getty\n\nLauer was fired at the end of November by NBC News after the network received a \xe2\x80\x9cdetailed complaint from a colleague about inappropriate sexual behavior,\xe2\x80\x9d with reason to believe \xe2\x80\x9cthis may not have been an isolated incident.\xe2\x80\x9d Women have also anonymously accused him of sexual harassment and assault in reports published by Variety and The New York Times.\n\nFollowing his firing, which was announced live on Today by Savannah Guthrie and Hoda Kotb, Lauer addressed the original allegations in a statement.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are no words to express my sorrow and regret for the pain I have caused others by words and actions,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in part. \xe2\x80\x9cTo the people I have hurt, I am truly sorry. As I am writing this, I realize the depth of the damage and disappointment I have left behind at home and at NBC.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAlthough her PEOPLE interview is the first time Couric has spoken in detail about Lauer\xe2\x80\x99s exit, she briefly broke her silence about the scandal on social media in December.\n\nIn a short response to an Instagram user, who called Couric out for not publicly addressing the scandal, the veteran journalist said, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s incredibly upsetting and I will say something when I\xe2\x80\x99m ready to.

"b'Jennifer Lopez and Mariah Carey (Photos: Getty Images)\n\nRumors of a feud between Jennifer Lopez and Mariah Carey have existed in Internet lore for years. And, like most pop star-on-pop star feuds which appear to exist solely in the minds of fans, it\xe2\x80\x99s the type of thing that the two are constantly having to deny. Twice this week Jennifer Lopez has had to address it and, twice this week, Lopez has denied it.\n\nSo here\xe2\x80\x99s how the whole thing went down.\n\nThe Beginnings\n\nIn the early \xe2\x80\x9800s, Mariah Carey was doing an interview with a foreign TV station in which she was asked her opinion about several pop stars. She called Beyonc\xc3\xa9 \xe2\x80\x9cnice\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ca good writer\xe2\x80\x9d and then she was asked about Jennifer Lopez. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know her,\xe2\x80\x9d Mariah Carey said. And, immediately, a meme was born.\n\nIf you\xe2\x80\x99ve not seen the GIF, you\xe2\x80\x99ve probably not spent a lot of time on the web.\n\nThe Aftermath\n\nIt is years later; \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know her\xe2\x80\x9d has become perhaps the most iconic words to come out of Mariah Carey\xe2\x80\x99s mouth since \xe2\x80\x9call I want for Christmas is you.\xe2\x80\x9d It was Andy Cohen, in 2014, who was the first to ask J.Lo directly about the shade of it all.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know from back in the day, I\xe2\x80\x99ve read things that she\xe2\x80\x99s said about me that were not the greatest, but we have never met,\xe2\x80\x9d Lopez, who is no amateur at delivering a verbal knockout, said. \xe2\x80\x9cLike, we don\xe2\x80\x99t know each other. I think it\xe2\x80\x99s kind of from word of mouth of things that have happened in the past that I\xe2\x80\x99m not really aware of.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThen, last year, Carey was doing an interview with The Cut in which she was asked about gifts she receives from her army of fans, the \xe2\x80\x9cLambs.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRecently? I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. [yawns] I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, I\xe2\x80\x99m having a \xe2\x80\x9csleep\xe2\x80\x9d moment\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n\n\nWell, there was a very interesting shirt that a fan made with a quote that I said years ago that, when I said it, I really wasn\xe2\x80\x99t trying to be funny. I was just being honest and everybody\xe2\x80\x99s kind of blowing it out of proportion but this guy had a shirt on and it was a picture of me that he made and the quote was underneath it \xe2\x80\x94 and I\xe2\x80\x99m going to leave you hanging as to what it was.\n\nStory continues\n\nTo recap: Carey yawns before she explains she was \xe2\x80\x9cjust being honest.\xe2\x80\x9d The word shade is thrown around hyperbolically these days, but true shade doesn\xe2\x80\x99t really sound like an insult. However, the recipient knows. Mariah Carey is one of the masters of the art.\n\nRound Two\n\nTalk of the feud picked up after last year\xe2\x80\x99s Billboard Music Awards, at which Lopez was caught checking Instagram during Carey\xe2\x80\x99s performance. Video of Lopez idly scrolling through her feed immediately became Lopez\xe2\x80\x99s visual response to Carey\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know her\xe2\x80\x9d GIF.\n\nWhich Brings Us to This Week\xe2\x80\xa6\n\nJennifer Lopez is currently on a media blitz promoting the staggering number of projects \xe2\x80\x94 Shades of Blue, American Idol, The Fosters, etc. \xe2\x80\x94 she\xe2\x80\x99s currently working on. Her first stop was Watch What Happens Live where, again, Andy Cohen asked about Mariah Carey.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFirst of all, that was not fair with the texting thing because I watched a lot of it \xe2\x80\x94 it was a long performance,\xe2\x80\x9c Lopez said, in what is not not shade. \xe2\x80\x9cI watched most of it, I may have looked down for one second and people were like, \xe2\x80\x98Look at her! Look at her!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLopez then booked it over to The Wendy Williams Show where she was talking about her Vegas residency, saying she saw all the shows currently on before she signed her deal, except for Mariah Carey because Carey\xe2\x80\x99s show didn\xe2\x80\x99t start until Lopez was already back in New York to film Shades of Blue. Williams saw her chance and took it with the gusto of a bird of prey.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho?\xe2\x80\x9d the talk show host joked of Carey. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, I\xe2\x80\x99m playing because that\xe2\x80\x99s what Mariah said about Jennifer one time.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe does say that,\xe2\x80\x9d Lopez responded, before delivering her magnum opus. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s forgetful I guess.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n'"

While hosting the E! Live from the Red Carpet Oscar special, Seacrest obviously had a slow night after publicists decided to steer their clients away from him because of the sexual misconduct claims.\n\nThis resulted in a 43 percent drop in ratings in key demographics compared to 2017, plus a 35 percent drop in overall number of viewers.\n\nRipa and her husband, Mark Consuelos, did walk by and acknowledge Seacrest by telling him he looked amazing and was doing a great job, but that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean she still isn\xe2\x80\x99t conflicted about the allegations.\n\nShe does want to side with her co-host, but no one thought he had any skeletons in the closet, and everyone is asking if he knew this was going to come out.\n\nRipa did seemingly take a dig at Seacrest on the show late last month when she asked him if he wanted her to put his shoes back on after they talked about having a treadmill day on the show. It seemed to be a reference to the allegations against Seacrest that included him pushing his accuser\xe2\x80\x99s head towards his crotch while she tied his shoes.\n\nBut, the next day, Ripa told audiences that she fully supported her co-host, saying that she adores him, and it is a privilege to work with him, and those words led Seacrest to tears.\n\nOscar emcee Jimmy Kimmel also had no problem talking with Seacrest and avoiding jumping to any conclusions about the allegations. He said that we should afford people the opportunity for truth and find out the facts before hanging someone out to dry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLive with Kelly and Ryan, starring Kelly Ripa and Ryan Seacrest, airs weekday mornings in syndication around the country.'"

In fact, it took months for him to make a first move! And as a kiss on this bridge would have been nice, the kiss a year later was so much sweeter. So on our 15th year of knowing each other we were able to open our hearts to each other to feel so much pure love and it\xe2\x80\x99s been truly incredible!""\n\nHe\'s a total family man.\n\nThis content is imported from Instagram.

It just feels so nice.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nDanny is Kate\'s support system.\n\nKate Hudson is an absolute powerhouse (see: her interview in the Women\'s Health December issue for proof). She\'s an actress, business mogul, and mom of three who still manages to find time for self-care and three to four workouts a week (including pole dancing!).

"b'The Voice features a rotating group of celebrity coaches mentoring up-and-coming talent. Gwen Stefani has played a big part in the show, coaching three seasons: Season 7, Season 9, and most recently Season 12. Her presence on The Voice extends beyond just coaching though. She\'s performed solo, mentored, and even did a duet with her boyfriend and fellow coach Blake Shelton. So, suffice to say, fans were surprised to hear she wouldn\'t be returning for Season 13, despite her popularity on the program. So, why isn\'t Gwen Stefani coaching The Voice Season 13? (Bustle reached out to NBC and Stefani\'s rep for comment, but has not yet received a response.)\n\nThis isn\'t Stefani\'s first time stepping away from her red spinning chair; she took a hiatus after Season 9, only to return for Season 12. At the time she took the break, Stefani told Extra she wanted to focus on her career. The Season 9-12 timeout had a clear purpose to it, she wanted to focus on making music and performing. Stefani\'s reasons for leaving this time are a little less defined, although the multi-night live show is a big commitment for already busy stars.\n\nMinus Stefani, the coaches for Season 13 are Shelton, Adam Levine, Miley Cyrus, and Jennifer Hudson. And, for now, Stefani is keeping busy with music and performances. Stefani is releasing a Christmas duet with Shelton Oct. 6 and is promoting the jingle on her Instagram.\n\nStefani\'s love for Shelton is as strong as ever, even without The Voice, and she\'s been promoting his upcoming album on her social media. In February of 2017, Stefani went on Late Night With Seth Meyers and talked about their musical and romantic unity saying, ""It\'s so unbelievable ... I love Blake, he\'s just the most incredible guy. Like, everybody loves Blake ... he\'s just a sparkly, happy, amazing person.""\n\nAccording to Stefani\'s social media, she\'s also continued to perform her music around the world. She posted the below Instagram on Sept. 15, preforming her classic hit ""Hollaback Girl"" in Korea. She\'s a seasoned performer and any time not spent coaching on The Voice will likely be spent doing concerts at home and abroad. While The Voice platform is large, the coaches are all successful outside the show as well.\n\nAnd, maybe Stefani will return for a future season. It\'s not like she\'ll stop being involved with The Voice since Shelton remains a coach. Hopefully the opportunity to coach new talent, the fun she seems to have on the program, and the fans will draw her back in at a future time \xe2\x80\x94 it\'s happened before when she left after Season 9 but came back for 12. And, ET reported in May of 2017 that Stefani would love to return to The Voice, but that her future on the show was uncertain. ""I don\'t have any plans to come back,"" she told the outlet. ""I love being here; I\'d love to come back. We\'ll see what happens next.""\n\nThe new season of The Voice airs Mondays and Tuesdays at 8 p.m. ET on NBC. New coaches Cyrus and Hudson should inject a new energy into the program, which will be anchored by longtime coaches Shelton and Levine. And, Hudson not only was a contestant on American Idol, she also was a Voice coach on the UK version of The Voice UK Season 6. So, she has plenty of experience to take Stefani\'s spot.\n\nThe Voice has remained a strong competition show because of its ability to mix things up. Hopefully, the shake-ups continue in the future and put Stefani back in a chair \xe2\x80\x94 because going too long without her would be bananas, b-a-n-a-n-a-s.'"
"b'Are they or aren\xe2\x80\x99t they?! Josh Duhamel finally responds to those Jennifer Garner dating rumors and he can\xe2\x80\x99t stop smiling!\n\nJosh Duhamel, 45, and Jennifer Garner, 45, are the same age, they\xe2\x80\x99re both in the business and they\xe2\x80\x99re both single. So, when rumors began to swirl that the two Hollywood A-listers were dating, fans went wild. However, you can pump the breaks on that one, because, although Duhamel thinks his Love, Simon co-star is \xe2\x80\x9cincredible,\xe2\x80\x9d he\xe2\x80\x99s laughing off those pesky dating rumors. \xe2\x80\x9cIt does truly amaze me what some of the things that are printed,\xe2\x80\x9d Duhamel told E! News at the premiere of the movie in Los Angeles on March 13. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s like, how is that even legal? I try not to comment on it. It is what it is and it\xe2\x80\x99s part of the business. We\xe2\x80\x99re in the circus and that\xe2\x80\x99s part of being in the circus.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWhile Duhamel is not dating Garner, their friendship is thriving \xe2\x80\x94 Hence their chemistry on-screen. \xe2\x80\x9cHer kids weren\xe2\x80\x99t on set, neither were mine. We were only there for I think, a week and a half, two weeks, working, but I went to Jen a couple times asking advice on certain things and she\xe2\x80\x99s an incredible woman, she really is,\xe2\x80\x9d Duhamel revealed. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s very, very smart. She\xe2\x80\x99s a lot funnier than I think people realize.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe two star in the new drama, Love, Simon, where they play the parents of a gay teenage son named Simon, played by Nick Robinson. Simon has kept his sexuality secret, even from his family. Meanwhile, he has fallen in love with a fellow, anonymous closeted classmate after exchanging emails with them. Then a blackmailer finds the emails and threatens to out Simon.\n\nAlthough Duhamel may not be romancing Garner, another report claims he is smitten with another actress. He\xe2\x80\x99s reportedly dating Eiza Gonz\xc3\xa1lez, 28, , according to Us Weekly, which claims the two met at Jennifer Lopez\xe2\x80\x98s pre-Super Bowl concert. Gonz\xc3\xa1lez has been romantically linked Liam Hemsworth, 28, and Calvin Harris, 34.\n\nFergie and Josh announced their split on September 14, 2017 after eight years of marriage and 13 years together. \xe2\x80\x9cWith absolute love and respect we decided to separate as a couple earlier this year,\xe2\x80\x9d the two said in a joint statement relayed by Fergie\xe2\x80\x99s rep. \xe2\x80\x9cTo give our family the best opportunity to adjust, we wanted to keep this a private matter before sharing it with the public. We are and will always be united in our support of each other and our family.\xe2\x80\x9d Despite their untimely ending, both Fergie and Josh remain good friends and continue to successfully co-parent their 4-year-old son Axl Jack.\n\nMeanwhile, Jennifer and her now ex-husband, Ben Affleck, 44, separated in 2015 after 10 years of marriage. They share three children together \xe2\x80\x94 Violet, 11, Seraphina, 8, and Samuel, 5, who they too, like Fergie and Josh, continue co-parent their kids as good friends. Ben and Jen officially filed for divorce in April 2017, with Jen reportedly making the first move.'"
"b'If the Grammy Awards proved anything on Jan. 28, they only solidified that Rihanna is kween and we all need to bow down. She always looks amazing, she\'s mega talented, and she has a badass attitude about life. Do not come for Rihanna or I will come for you. If RiRi is hanging out with someone, especially a potential boyfriend, you best believe fans will jump all over it... or so you would think. Her latest rumored relationship has managed to stay surprisingly low-key. Who is Rihanna dating? His name is Hassan Jameel and the two have been linked together for about seven months.\n\nBack in June of 2017, photos were released of RiRi getting hot and heavy with Jameel in a hot tub. The photos have since been deleted, but people were mostly wondering who the heck this seemingly random guy with Rihanna was in Spain.\n\nAs it turns out, Jameel is extremely well-known throughout the world. As the Toyota heir, he\'s wealthy \xe2\x80\x94 like, really wealthy. For 80 years, Jameel\'s family has been, ""the sole owners of the right to sell Toyota cars in Saudi Arabia,"" according to COED. This results in his net worth sitting at a hefty $1.5 billion.\n\nIn addition, the 29-year-old also serves as the deputy president and vice chairman of his family\'s company, Abdul Latif Jameel. According to Daily Mail, this is one of the biggest companies in the entire world.\n\nMoney is great, but I don\'t think it matters to Rihanna one bit. With her own net worth at $36 million, according to Forbes, she can take care of her own damn self. This relationship is definitely rooted in good ol\' fashioned chemistry. According to a source from Daily Mail, Rihanna is ""smitten"" with Jameel. The source said,\n\nThis relationship is the real deal. Rihanna has told friends she\'s in love with him and seems completely smitten. They\'ve been spending a lot of time together away from prying eyes and are really serious. They\'re really enjoying each others\' company.\n\nLike I said earlier, all this info came to the surface back in June. After a quick obsession session, everyone moved on to other things. Rihanna, Jameel, and their potential relationship was swept under the rug, and I didn\'t know if we would ever hear from them again.\n\nThat is, until the 2018 Grammys. After Rihanna won her Grammy for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration with Kendrick Lamar and performed ""Wild Thoughts"" with DJ Khaled and Bryson Tiller, she went out to celebrate.\n\nKevin Winter/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images\n\nAccording to E! News, Rihanna and Jameel were both seen at the famous 1 OAK nightclub in NYC. Although they arrived and were photographed separately, sources claim the two were ""coupled up"" all night. A source said the two weren\'t afraid to flaunt a little PDA, and Rihanna ""seemed so happy"" with Jameel. The source told E!,\n\nRihanna and Hassan showed affection throughout the evening. It was cool because he can roll with Rihanna, he fits in great.\n\nThe source continued,\n\nHe was always making sure she was OK and had everything she needed. Rihanna was dancing and having a great time.\n\nThe two sound like a fabulous couple. Another eyewitness account of the two came from realtor and famous NYC and Miami socialite, Malcolm Edwards. He exclusively told E!,\n\nRihanna was sitting with her boyfriend Hassan at 1 OAK owner Richie Akiva\'s table. They weren\'t being overly romantic but definitely showed some PDA throughout the night. They were happy to see Diddy and his girlfriend Cassie when they showed up at the table. They hugged and kissed hello. The foursome laughed throughout the night and enjoyed music.\n\nAt the owner\'s table with Diddy... no biggie. Just a day in the life of Rihanna. The two being friends with other couples could prove that their relationship is getting serious. Hopefully, we\'ll be hearing more about Rihanna and Jameel in the near future.\n\nBasically, if Rihanna is happy, I\'m happy. It\'s so exciting the singer may have a new-ish man in her life to celebrate the good stuff. NOTHING BUT GOOD THOUGHTS AND WISHES FOR RIRI.\n\nCheck out the entire Gen Why series and other videos on Facebook and the Bustle app across Apple TV, Roku, and Amazon Fire TV.'"

"b'Tim McGraw and Faith Hill have one of the most iconic love stories in country music. A true musical power couple, this Tennessee duo is incredibly strong together \xe2\x80\x93 as we\'ve seen with their decades of duets and their consistently growing Soul2Soul world tour. Not to mention their ever-present, electric chemistry.\n\nBut this road to being one of our favorite couples to watch hasn\'t always been a straight line for Tim and Faith. Yes, they now have an exhibit at the Country Music Hall of Fame (aptly subtitled Mississippi Woman/Louisiana Man), three gorgeous daughters, and countless Grammy, CMA, ACM, and Billboard awards \xe2\x80\x93 but they\'ve also experienced some detours.\n\nHowever, the end result for team McGraw-Hill is still the same: Tim and Faith love each other more than ever.\n\nTheir journey began back in 1994, when the two met backstage at a Country Radio seminar in Nashville. The sparks between them were instant \xe2\x80\x93 much to the chagrin of Tim\'s then-girlfriend, as he told Billboard in a recent cover story. ""For me, there was an intense physical attraction. I guess my girlfriend saw it in my eyes. She said, \xe2\x80\x98I don\'t want you around her.\'""\n\nDuring a visit to The Bobby Bones Show in Nashville, the two talked about how they started dating. ""It took a bunch of times [of asking her out],"" Tim said. But, the ""official"" first time, as Faith describes, was something out of a Southern storybook.\n\n""[Tim] brought me chicken and dumplings. [He] came to my house [unannounced]. He knocked on my door, and he had a bowl of homemade chicken dumplings.""\n\n""And cornbread!"" Tim chimed in.\n\n""He said, \'I made these myself. They\'re homemade from scratch.\' He had the bowl covered in aluminum foil, and he had a spoon and a fork on top of the bowl. He said, \'I didn\'t know if you liked to eat your dumplings with a spoon or a fork.\'""\n\n""You make up for your inadequacies,"" Tim laughed.\n\nIn 1996, when Tim decided to ask a then-engaged Faith to open for him on his first headlining tour. Just a few months later, the country lovebirds were dueting together onstage and shared a not-so-subtle kiss. In a whirlwind romance, the two married in October 1996.\n\nAlthough the couple was seemingly meant to be, there was one part of their story that connected them very strongly \xe2\x80\x93 both had family backgrounds that left them searching for a missing piece of the puzzle.\n\nFor Tim, that came in the route of his famous baseball father, Tug McGraw, who denied paternity after Tim\'s mother became pregnant coming into her senior year of high school. With an abusive stepfather and a biological father who wouldn\'t acknowledge him, Tim struggled with filling that gap.\n\nFaith\'s search, as an adopted child, was in her ""gypsy"" spirit that didn\'t seem to fit in with the rest of her family. She told Billboard, ""I used to think there was some kind of conspiracy, that I must be the daughter of one of my aunts. And of course I used to dream I was Elvis\' daughter. I have a great family: salt of the earth, hardworking. But I\'m a gypsy at heart. I had a spirit that was completely outside what my family was. I didn\'t know anyone I was related to, biologically, which gives you a sense of not \xc2\xadknowing who you are.""\n\nMcGraw summed up their connection through these family issues perfectly. ""I knew I had that \xc2\xadinstability and dysfunction in me, from the way I grew up. And when I met Faith, I knew I needed her in my life\xe2\x80\x93to keep me stable, solid and on track.""\n\nWATCH: Tim & Faith Announced A New Joint Album\n\nAnd on track the two have stayed, even through Tim\'s drug and alcohol abuse in the mid-2000s. Faith gave Tim \xe2\x80\x93 father to Gracie, Maggie Elizabeth, and Audrey \xe2\x80\x93 an ultimatum. With the choice to keep his family intact, Tim shed forty pounds and started training with a martial arts master.'"
"b'Katy Perry and Orlando Bloom are a celeb couple that no one saw coming, and yet... they totally make sense.\n\nThe two lovebirds both have an extensive celebrity dating and marriage history, with Perry being linked to stars like John Mayer, Robert Pattinson, and of course ex-husband Russell Brand. Meanwhile, Orlando has been with stars like Kate Bosworth, Selena Gomez, and ex-wife Miranda Kerr.\n\nPerry and Bloom started dating in early 2016 after meeting at a Golden Globes after party. And although there were reports that they were breaking up in early 2017, it seems the couple may have reconciled and are giving love another go \xe2\x80\x94 and according to some sources, may have already gotten eloped! Their relationship is not without its drama, though.\n\n1. Bloom infamously went paddleboarding naked with Perry.\n\nWhile on a romantic getaway to Italy with Perry, Bloom left nothing to the imagination and stripped naked for a paddleboard ride and of course, the paps were there to snap some photos. Unsurprisingly, these photos spread over the internet like wildfire.\n\nIn an interview with Elle UK, Bloom admitted he had no idea there was paparazzi following them. ""I\'ve been photographed a million times in a million ways. I have a good radar,"" he stated. ""We\'d been completely alone for five days. Nothing around us. There was no way anyone could get anything. So I had a moment of feeling free.""\n\nAfter seeing the photo, Bloom admitted to Elle that had he known he was being watched and photographed, ""I wouldn\'t have put myself in that position if I\'d thought it would happen.""\n\n2. Russell Brand divorced Perry for being ""vapid.""\n\nPerry was previously married to actor and comedian Russell Brand for almost two years before sadly splitting. In this article from E! Online, Perry admitted the split was difficult on her, stating, ""He\'s a very smart man, a magical man and I was in love with him when I married him. Let\'s just say I haven\'t heard from him since he texted me saying he was divorcing me December 31, 2011."" Ouch.\n\nAccording to E! News, in his 2015 documentary BRAND: The Second Coming, Brand allegedly mocks his relationship with Perry. ""I\'m living this life of the very thing I detest,"" he says before the footage cuts to images of him and Perry. ""Vapid, vacuous celebrity.""\n\n3. Bloom allegedly cheated on ex-wife Miranda Kerr.\n\nBloom was married to Victoria\'s Secret model Miranda Kerr for three years, whom he shares a son with. The couple shared a rough split in 2013 after reports surfaced of Bloom cheating on Kerr with a 21-year-old waitress in London.\n\nDespite the harsh accusations, the two now have a good friendship and co-parenting skills. Kerr opened up to Marie Clare UK about her relationship with Bloom, stating the divorce was the ""the right thing to do,"" explaining, ""we weren\'t bringing out the best in each other."" She continued, saying, ""There\xe2\x80\x99s no hostility there, we\xe2\x80\x99ll always be friends.""\n\n4. Bloom reportedly cheated on Perry with Selena Gomez.\n\nPhoto: Hollywood Life\n\nWhile Bloom and Perry were reportedly still together, Bloom was spotted out with pop princess Selena Gomez \xe2\x80\x94 and they reportedly got very close and comfortable with each other.\n\nAccording to TMZ, Bloom made a surprise appearance at Gomez\'s afterparty for a 2016 concert in Vegas. Photos taken of the two show they were all over each other. Just a week prior, Orlando was spotted out with Katy at a Met Gala afterparty leading most to believe that they were still together while he was out with Gomez.\n\nAnother theory brought up was the fact that Bloom might have been getting cozy with Gomez to get back at his ex Kerr, who was rumored to have dated Selena\'s ex Justin Bieber. Back in 2012, Bloom and Bieber reportedly got in a fight while in Ibiza due to the rumors about Bieber and Kerr. Bloom reportedly threw a punch at Bieber after some words were exchanged. Kerr has stated publicly that she never had sex with or dated Justin.\n\n5. Perry and Bloom broke up for a year.\n\nAfter 10 months of dating, Perry and Bloom confirmed via a joint statement that they were indeed breaking up. In an article from E! News, their rep stated, ""Before rumors or falsifications get out of hand we can confirm that Orlando and Katy are taking respectful, loving space at this time."" According to the source, Perry was the one who decided to end things between them but another source reported that the split was mutual and that things between them hadn\'t been good for months.\n\n""It was a few events that happened over the past few months. They both still love each other very much, though, and getting back together could happen once they have some space"", the rep stated to E!.\n\nIn an interview with Elle UK, Bloom stated that he and Perry were still friends after their break up. He said, ""It\'s good. We\'re all grown-up. She happens to be someone who is very visible, but I don\'t think anybody cares what I\'m up to. Nor should they. It\'s between us. It\'s better to set an example for kids and show that breakups don\'t have to be about hate.""\n\n6. The couple reportedly reunited in 2018.'"

"b'It\'s been almost two years since Angelina Jolie announced her split from Brad Pitt, and their divorce continues to get ugly.\n\nIn court documents filed Tuesday, Jolie\'s attorneys allege Pitt hasn\'t paid any ""meaningful"" child support for a year and a half. Now, she\'s planning to seek a court order for retroactive funds.\n\nNBC News obtained the court docs, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, in which Jolie\'s lawyers request a status conference with a judge.\n\n""(Pitt) has a duty to pay child support,"" wrote Jolie attorney Samantha Bley DeJean, NBC reports. ""As of present, (Pitt) has paid no meaningful child support since separation.""\n\nBut a person familiar with the situation not authorized to speak publicly disputes the notion Pitt has not been financially responsible for his children, telling USA TODAY Pitt has fulfilled his commitments.\n\nMore from USA Today:\n\n""The aim of Angelina\'s routine court filing is to provide closure to the marriage in a way that clears a path toward the next stage of their lives and allows her and Brad to recommit as devoted coparents to their children,"" Jolie spokesperson Mindy Nyby tells USA TODAY.\n\nThe couple have six children: Maddox, 17; Pax, 14; Zahara, 13; Shiloh, 12; and 10-year old twins Vivienne and Knox.\n\nOn the career front, both actors have been busy. Jolie has been filming ""Maleficent 2"" this summer in London, while Pitt is currently filming Quentin Tarantino\'s ""Once Upon a Time in Hollywood"" alongside Leonardo DiCaprio. Pitt\'s upcoming sci-fi film ""Ad Astra"" is set for release on January 11, 2019.\n\nJolie filed for divorce in September 2016, claiming the separation was ""for the health of the family."" The famous couple proceeded to battle publicly \xe2\x80\x93 always through their reps \xe2\x80\x93 for months over custody of their children.\n\nBut Jolie and Pitt seemed to bury the hatchet in January 2017, releasing a joint statement saying they had agreed to handle their divorce in a private forum and would work together to reunify their family.\n\nThat changed this June, when their custody struggle exploded in the spotlight once again after multiple outlets reported Jolie could be in danger of losing custody if she didn\'t start encouraging her children to forge relationships with her ex.\n\nA judge in Jolie and Pitt\'s divorce case determined that their six children\'s lack of ""a relationship with their father is harmful to them,"" adding that, ""it is critical that each of them have a healthy and strong relationship with their father and mother.""\n\nRepresentatives for Jolie pushed back, calling the reports inaccurate and an unfair depiction of what was going on behind the scenes.\n\nJolie continues to be represented by divorce lawyer Laura Wasser, Nyby said. Pitt has been represented by Lance Spiegel.\n\nLawyers for Pitt and Jolie did not respond to requests for comment.'"

"b'The parent company of Fox News says it knew about a settlement over sexual harassment allegations against Bill O\'Reilly by an on-air analyst before the company extended the ex-host\'s $25 million contract in February.\n\nIn response to a New York Times story published Saturday, 21st Century Fox says it knew of the settlement but not the monetary amount. The Times reports O\'Reilly reached a settlement worth $32 million with Lis Wiehl, a longtime Fox News legal analyst. CBS News has not confirmed the amount of the settlement. O\'Reilly denied doing anything improper in an interview with the Times.\n\nWiehl accused O\'Reilly of harassment and ""a nonconsensual sexual relationship,"" according to the Times, which cited unnamed sources briefed on the settlement. The paper reports Wiehl\'s attorneys sent a draft of a lawsuit to O\'Reilly on Jan. 2, and the parties reached a settlement a few days later.\n\nGet Breaking News Delivered to Your Inbox\n\nFox News extended O\'Reilly\'s contract six weeks later, boosting his pay from $18 million to $25 million.\n\n""When the company renewed Bill O\'Reilly\'s contract in February, it knew that a sexual harassment lawsuit had been threatened against him by Lis Wiehl, but was informed by Mr. O\'Reilly that he had settled the matter personally, on financial terms that he and Ms. Wiehl had agreed were confidential and not disclosed to the company,"" 21 Century Fox said in a statement to CBS News on Saturday.\n\n""His new contract, which was made at a time typical for renewals of multi-year talent contracts, added protections for the company specifically aimed at harassment, including that Mr. O\'Reilly could be dismissed if the company was made aware of other allegations or if additional relevant information was obtained in a company investigation,"" the company said. ""The company subsequently acted based on the terms of this contract.""\n\nMark Fabiani, an attorney for O\'Reilly issued a statement denouncing the Times story later Saturday.\n\n""In its latest diatribe against Bill O\'Reilly, the Times printed leaked information provided by anonymous sources that is out of context, false, defamatory, and obviously designed to embarrass Bill O\'Reilly and to keep him from competing in the marketplace,"" he wrote.\n\nFabiani also released an affidavit signed by Wiehl in which she says she and O\'Reilly have ""resolved all our issues.""\n\n""I would no longer make the allegations contained in the draft complaint,"" she wrote.\n\nO\'Reilly was fired in April after settlements with multiple women over accusations of sexual harassment came to light. He had been at the network for more than 20 years.\n\n21st Century Fox said Saturday that it had taken ""concerted action"" to overhaul Fox News and replace members of the network\'s leadership. It said it also increased ""the channels through which employees can report harassment or discrimination.""\n\n""These changes come from the top, with Lachlan and James Murdoch personally leading the effort to promote civility and respect on the job, while maintaining the Company\'s long-held commitment to a diverse, inclusive and creative workplace,"" the company said.'"

Valuable things should be paid for.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIn 2015, Swift began to soften her stance, first making 1989 available on Apple Music after Apple changed its policies on paying artists and musician\xe2\x80\x99s royalties.

"b'Ever since he and Angelina Jolie announced their separation, Brad Pitt\'s love life has been a struggle to keep up with. That\'s not due to any actual action on his own part; it\'s wading through all of the rumors.

As it turns out, though, Pitt is allegedly still single and relishing that fact.\n\n""He has gone on dates but he\xe2\x80\x99s not looking to leap into a serious relationship at the moment,"" a source close to Pitt told Entertainment Tonight. ""He is content on his own and enjoys the quality time he spends with the children when he isn\xe2\x80\x99t working.""\n\nInstead of spending time on his love life, Pitt has apparently been putting all of his energy into parenting the six children he shares with Jolie, as well as his career, which includes a starring role in Quentin Tarantino\'s Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. ""He is focused on two of the most important things he should be focused on, and those are his children and his work,"" the source said, adding that Pitt is \xe2\x80\x9cin a great place personally and professionally\xe2\x80\xa6.

Now you have to be real careful not to go too far that way and get cut off in that way. I\'m really good at cutting myself off, and it\'s been a problem.

"b'Miley Cyrus\xe2\x80\x99 new album, Younger Now, is set to release next month. So far we have three songs and I\xe2\x80\x99m not in love with any of them. I\xe2\x80\x99m meh on Younger Now but I find Malibu and Inspired practically unlistenable. There\xe2\x80\x99s a few left to release, though, including Rainbowland featuring her godmother, Dolly Parton. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure one of them will appeal to me.\n\nAnyway, with all this new music coming out, people are once again wondering if Miley and fianc\xc3\xa9 Liam Hemsworth will ever walk down the aisle. I maintain that the speculation is as much the couple\xe2\x80\x99s doing as the press. I think Miley likes us talking about her and she knows this is one thing fans will never tired of. However, if Life & Style is to be believed, it goes much deeper than that. L&S claims that Miley pitched a major fit over Liam not wearing his promise ring and the fight grew loud before she gave him the silent treatment for almost two days.\n\nWhen Miley Cyrus channeled her inner Beyonc\xc3\xa9 and put a ring on longtime boyfriend Liam Hemsworth, it was supposed to be a sign of their commitment to each other. There was just one small problem: the Australian actor refused to wear it. That did not sit well with Miley, 24, and sources reveal exclusively to Life & Style that the piece of jewelry became the subject of a nasty shouting match. \xe2\x80\x9cShe pushed him and pushed him to wear the ring,\xe2\x80\x9d the insider says, \xe2\x80\x9cand she finally lost her temper and was screaming at him furiously. The fight was one of the worst they\xe2\x80\x99ve ever had.\xe2\x80\x9d The former Disney star was so mad she actually threw her phone to the ground and smashed it. \xe2\x80\x9cShe refused to talk to him for almost two days after that,\xe2\x80\x9d the source adds. Liam, 27, has since apologized and agreed to wear the promise ring. He was recently spotted out with the hardware on that finger, prompting wedding rumors. However, the couple is not walking down the aisle anytime soon. Miley and Liam, who have been engaged on and off since 2012, both agree the fight has strengthened their relationship. \xe2\x80\x9cThings have turned around lately,\xe2\x80\x9d the source tells Life & Style. \xe2\x80\x9cMiley and Liam are so much happier now.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n[From Life & Style]\n\nWait a minute \xe2\x80\x93 these two are engaged so this is an engagement ring, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? If you need a promise ring when you\xe2\x80\x99re engaged, you have bigger issues. But it definitely sounds like they have issues if Miley is smashing phones. The question is, of course, did this happen? I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, I\xe2\x80\x99m inclined to think it might have. Not that the fight was solely over the ring but the ring was the last straw and Miley snapped. I get it, she\xe2\x80\x99s under a lot of pressure. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard the songs yet but the titles are all about love and coupledom \xe2\x80\x93 if Malibu is any indication, this album is one giant love note to Liam. And given Liam\xe2\x80\x99s track record, I guess I can understand why she needs a symbolic gesture. If it is true, I\xe2\x80\x99m glad Liam made the effort by finally wearing the ring.\n\nUnfortunately, Liam\xe2\x80\x99s lack of ring is not all Miley has to deal with. She is among those to have intimate photos stolen in the latest hacking scandal. Oh, how I hate these creeps, I hope they get what\xe2\x80\x99s coming to them. I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to give them any more space so that\xe2\x80\x99s all I will say about that. On a nicer note, Miley bought a ranch in Nashville and I am positively emerald with envy. You can see pictures here, it\xe2\x80\x99s just gorgeous. It would also be a beautiful setting for a wedding.

"b""The backlash surrounding comedian Kathy Griffin\xe2\x80\x99s reviled photo shoot depicting her holding the severed head of President Trump hasn\xe2\x80\x99t let down since it first exploded earlier this week.\n\nIn just the last few days she\xe2\x80\x99s been dumped by CNN, Squatty Potty and several venues across the country. Even friend and \xe2\x80\x9cNew Year\xe2\x80\x99s Eve Live\xe2\x80\x9d sidekick Anderson Cooper was quick to distance himself from his former co-host, calling her photo \xe2\x80\x9cdisgusting.\xe2\x80\x9d Now many are asking whether the comedian can survive her self-inflicted wound \xe2\x80\x94 one that\xe2\x80\x99s increasingly threatening to derail her career.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeing dropped by CNN definitely hurts her visibility,\xe2\x80\x9d Matt Hiltzik, a New York-based communications consultant whose clients have included Harvey Weinstein, Alec Baldwin and Justin Bieber, told TheWrap. \xe2\x80\x9cHer business will be fine. But her opportunities to grow beyond her core base will be limited.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAlso Read: Fox News Panel Ponders If 'Wonder Woman' Is Patriotic Enough\n\nAfter widespread condemnation over her graphic photo, Griffin apologized on Tuesday, begging for forgiveness and acknowledging she \xe2\x80\x9cwent too far.\xe2\x80\x9d But on Friday, she held an impromptu press conference with attorney Lisa Bloom, telling reporters she\xe2\x80\x99s been bullied by Trump\xe2\x80\x99s family while vowing to mock the president even more in the future.\n\nBut if the intent was to quash the flurry of negative headlines that have dominated the news cycle in recent days, it may have missed the mark.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cKathy Griffin claims \xe2\x80\x98conspiracy\xe2\x80\x99 at mad, looping press conference,\xe2\x80\x9d proclaimed Salon.

Good luck with that. Is she trying to say she\xe2\x80\x99s the victim? I think 99 percent of the people would disagree with that.

This will go away if she just shuts up. There is a real crisis in this country right now and anything she says is just a distraction.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe good news for Griffin is that she can recover \xe2\x80\xa6 but it might take a while for the whole thing to blow over.\n\nAlso Read: 34 Streaming TV Shows You Can Binge Watch in a Weekend (Photos)\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s going to have to recalibrate and reconsider,\xe2\x80\x9d Bragman said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut in no way is this going to end her career.

"b'9 / 0\n\nBrad Pitt accused of child abuse following an altercation with 15-year-old Maddox\n\n\n\nThe most plausible cause for the Jolie-Pitt marriage break-down is also the saddest. New reports suggest an altercation between Brad and his 15-year-old son Maddox while Pitt was intoxicated on a 12-hour flight on the family\'s private jet caused the split. Pitt has since been investigated by the FBI for child abuse (as the altercation happened while the family were in the air) after an anonymous third party called child protection services once the flight landed.\n\n\n\nTwo members of the Jolie-Pitt staff spoke to The Sun about the incident, denying rumours that Pitt physically hit Maddox, but stating that the fight ""started on the way to the airport before the plane took off and escalated on the plane"". The incident happened on September 14th and Jolie cited the pair\'s separation date as being September 15th in her divorce paperwork. According to reports Brad has not seen the children since the incident, and is ""distraught and terrified.""'"

Are they dating?\n\nCara Delevingne, 25, and Paris Jackson, 20, have been stirring up romance rumors left and right and their latest outing is only fueling the fire. The pair were spotted hanging out together in New York City just a few hours after they each attended the Longchamp Fifth Avenue store opening on May 3. Paris wore a printed white t-shirt, jeans, and black booties, while the Paper Towns star rocked a strikingly similar ensemble: a white tank top, denim Bermuda shorts and black knee-high boots.\n\nWhile the two women have yet to confirm whether or not they\xe2\x80\x99re dating, fans are dying to know their relationship status.

It was announced that a steering group would research solutions to problems facing young people, and how it impacted society and the economy.[171] Later that month, Kensington Palace announced the Duchess of Cambridge would become the first royal patron of the Victoria and Albert Museum.[172][173] In June 2019, she succeeded the Queen as patron of the Royal Photographic Society.[174] In January 2020, she and other photographers took part in an exhibition to mark the 75th anniversary of the end of the Holocaust.[175] In July 2019, she lent her support to Backyard Nature, a campaign created to inspire ""children, families and communities to get outside and engage with nature"".[176] In August 2019, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge competed in the King\'s Cup yachting regatta to raise money for eight different charities.[177] In December 2019, she succeeded the Queen as Royal Patron of Family Action.[178]\n\nIn January 2020, the Duchess launched ""5 Big Questions on the Under 5\'s"", a nationwide survey on development in early years.[179] The survey was conducted by Ipsos MORI, and contains ""further qualitative and ethnographic research"" on the early years.[180] ""5 Big Questions"" received over 500,000 responses.[181][182] In May and June 2020, the Duke and Duchess, alongside their children, delivered food parcels made on the Sandringham Estate to local isolated pensioners during the COVID-19 pandemic.[183][184] In July 2020, the Duchess supported and assisted in the development of BBC\'s ""Tiny Happy People"" initiative, providing free digital resources to parents with young children.[185] In August 2020, she headed a donation drive to benefit baby banks nationwide, including Little Village, which spurred over 10,000 donations from Marks & Spencer, Tesco, John Lewis & Partners, and Sainsbury\'s.[186][187] In May 2020, the Duchess as the patron of the National Portrait Gallery launched ""Hold Still"", a project to capture people\'s life during lockdown, which garnered 31,000 submissions.[188][189] In July 2020, the exhibition was released, with the final 100 photographs being displayed online. In October 2020, the portraits were displayed on 112 public sites, including billboards, murals, and posters, across 80 towns and cities.[190][191] The online exhibition collected over 5.2 million page views.[192]\n\nAdvocating for mental health\n\nCatherine, who has tackled issues surrounding mental health and disabilities, has made visits to charities and hospitals such as St Thomas\' Hospital and Maurice Wohl Clinical Neuroscience Institute to spend time with mothers and children who deal with these issues.[193][194][195] To encourage people to open up about their mental health issues, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry initiated the mental health awareness campaign ""Heads Together"" in April 2016. The campaign was first envisioned by the Duchess earlier that year.[196] The Duchess later voluntarily talked about her problems as a mother, and admitted that she suffered a ""lack of confidence"" and ""feelings of ignorance"" during certain periods of time.[9][193][197]\n\nThe Duchess of Cambridge also launched the Mentally Healthy Schools, a project which helps the students and staff with access ""to reliable and practical resources to improve awareness, knowledge and confidence in supporting pupils\' mental health.""[198] Benita Refson, president of Place2Be, one of Catherine\'s patronages, has praised the Duchess\'s work saying she would help ""shine the spotlight on child mental health.""[199] In February 2016, she travelled to Edinburgh to promote the work of Place2Be, launched Children\'s Mental Health Week, and contributed to the HuffPost UK as a part of the Young Minds Matter movement, an effort ""to raise awareness for children\'s mental health issues.""[200][201] The Duke and Duchess later met with members and representatives of Young Minds and Youthscape to promote their mental health campaign.[202] In recognition of their work with charities concerned with children\'s mental health, the Duchess and her husband were awarded the Gold Blue Peter badge, an award previously granted to the Queen.[203] During a speech at the Royal Foundation forum in 2018, the Duchess said she would continue her work to raise awareness for mental health and said that ""The mental health of children and adults is one area where a long-term view will make all the difference to future generations.""[204]\n\nIn January 2019, it was confirmed that the Duchess would work together with the Royal Horticultural Society as one of the co-designers for a garden display at the 2019 Chelsea Flower Show.[205] Catherine designed the ""Back to Nature Garden"" together with Andree Davies and Adam White.[206] The garden, which featured ""a tree house, waterfall, rustic den and a campfire"" among other parts, was unveiled at the Chelsea Flower Show in May 2019 to emphasise ""the benefits the natural world brings to mental and physical well-being"".[207][208] The garden was later expanded and moved to Hampton Court Palace as a part of the Hampton Court Palace Flower Show.[209] In May 2019, as a part of their ""Heads Together"" initiative, the Duchess of Cambridge together with her husband and in-laws, launched Shout, a text messaging service for those who suffer from mental issues.[210] In October 2019, the Duchess of Cambridge, together with other members of the royal family, voiced a PSA video for Public Health England ""as part of its Every Mind Matters program"".[211] In late March 2020, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge started supporting a new mental health initiative by the Public Health England amidst the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom.[212] In Britain\'s Maternal Mental Health Awareness Week of May 2020, she engaged in a video call with new parents, midwives and other maternity service professionals to promote her message of mental health awareness during the pandemic.[213]\n\nPublic image and style\n\nMiddleton, prominent for her fashion style, has been placed on numerous ""best dressed"" lists.[214][215] The Daily Telegraph selected her as the Most Promising Newcomer on its 2006 list of style winners and losers.[216] Tatler placed her at number eight on its yearly list of the top ten style icons in 2007.[217] People featured her on its 2007 and 2010 best-dressed lists.[218] Middleton was named one of Richard Blackwell\'s ten Fabulous Fashion Independents of 2007.[219] In June 2008, Style.com selected her as its monthly beauty icon.[220] In July 2008, Vanity Fair included her on its international best-dressed list.[221] In February 2011 the Global Language Monitor named her the Top Fashion buzzword of the 2011 season.[222] In January 2012, the Headwear Association voted her Headwear Person of the Year.[223] Middleton was number one on Vanity Fair\'s annual best dressed lists in 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013; she also appeared as the cover star in 2012.[224] The Duchess was named to the International Best Dressed Hall of Fame List in 2014.[225] In 2014, she was already being regarded as a British cultural icon, with young adults from abroad naming her among a group of people who they most associated with UK culture. These included: William Shakespeare, Queen Elizabeth II, David Beckham, J. K. Rowling, The Beatles, Charlie Chaplin, Elton John and Adele.[226][227] In June 2016, she took part in her first magazine shoot for Vogue\'s centenary issue appearing on the cover.[228] In 2018, Tatler named her on its list of Britain\'s best dressed people, praising her for ""recycling her looks, rather than wearing them as one-offs"", as well as her use of ""both high street and high-end brands"".[229]\n\nThe ""Kate Middleton effect""[10][230] is the trend that the Duchess is reported to have had on others in sales of particular products. While Catherine wears items from many new designers, she has also worn dresses by Catherine Walker, who designed many of Diana\'s favourite evening gowns and day suits.[231] She has worn outfits, hats and ensembles by many other fashion designers.[232][233] The brands she favours are noted in the media.[232][233]\n\nThe Duchess, who attended the 71st British Academy Film Awards, did not participate in Time\'s Up movement calling for women to wear black on the red carpet.[234] Royal protocol forbids members of the royal family from taking part in political movements but she wore a black sash and carried a black handbag as a variation to the informal black dress code.[235][236] In March 2018, together with the Countess of Wessex, the Duchess hosted the Commonwealth Fashion Exchange reception at Buckingham Palace during 2018 London Fashion Week.[237]\n\nPrivacy and the media\n\nThe death of Diana, Princess of Wales, in Paris while being chased by paparazzi in 1997,[238] influenced the Duke\'s attitude towards the media.[239] The Duchess and her husband have asked that, when off-duty, their privacy should be respected.[239]\n\nAfter her graduation from university, Middleton was faced with widespread press attention and was often photographed by the paparazzi.[240][241] On 17 October 2005, she complained through her lawyer about harassment from the media, stating she had done nothing significant to warrant publicity.[242] Media attention increased around the time of her 25th birthday in January 2007, prompting warnings from the Prince of Wales, Prince William, and Middleton\'s lawyers, who threatened legal action. Two newspaper groups, News International, which publishes The Times and The Sun; and the Guardian Media Group, publishers of The Guardian, decided to refrain from publishing paparazzi photographs of her.[243] In 2009, Middleton was awarded \xc2\xa310,000 damages and an apology from the photographic press agency Rex Features Ltd. after she was photographed playing tennis on Christmas Eve while on holiday in Cornwall.[244] In 2010, she pursued an invasion of privacy claim against two agencies and photographer Niraj Tanna, who took photographs of her over Christmas 2009.[245] Middleton obtained a public apology, \xc2\xa35,000 in damages, and legal costs.[246]\n\nIn September 2012, the French edition of Closer and the Italian gossip magazine Chi, published photographs of the Duchess sun-bathing topless while on holiday at the Ch\xc3\xa2teau d\'Autet[239] (a private ch\xc3\xa2teau on a 260-ha estate 71 km[247] north of Aix-en-Provence). Analysts from The Times believed the photographs were taken from the D22 (Vaucluse) road half a kilometre from the pool\xe2\x80\x94a distance that would require an 800-mm or a 1000-mm lens.[248] On 17 September 2012, the Duke and Duchess filed a criminal complaint with the French prosecution department and launched a claim for civil damages at the Tribunal de Grande Instance de Nanterre.[249] The following day the courts granted an injunction against Closer, prohibiting further publication of the photographs and announced a criminal investigation would be initiated.[250] Under French law, punitive damages cannot be awarded[251] but intrusions of privacy are a criminal offence carrying a maximum jail sentence of one year and a fine of up to \xe2\x82\xac45,000 for individuals and \xe2\x82\xac225,000 for companies.[252][253] In September 2017, Closer was fined \xe2\x82\xac100,000 and its editor Laurence Pieau and owner Ernesto Mauri were each fined \xe2\x82\xac45,000.[254]\n\nIn December 2012, two Australian radio hosts, Michael Christian and Mel Greig, called King Edward VII\'s Hospital where the Duchess was an in-patient for hyperemesis gravidarum. Pretending to be the Queen and the Prince of Wales, Greig and Christian spoke to a nurse on the Duchess\'s ward, enquiring about her condition. Following a hospital inquiry and a public backlash against the hoax, Jacintha Saldanha, the nurse who put the call through to the ward, committed suicide.[255] The radio hosts subsequently apologised for their actions.[256]\n\nIn February 2013, Chi published the first photos of Catherine\'s exposed baby bump, taken during her vacation on the private island of Mustique. The British press refused to publish the paparazzi shots.[257] While the Duchess was visiting the Blue Mountains in Sydney, a picture was taken of her bare bottom as her dress blew up. Many newspapers outside the UK published the picture.[258]\n\nOn 14 August 2015, Kensington Palace published a letter detailing what it stated were the ""dangerous"" and invasive efforts of the media to get paparazzi pictures of Prince George and Princess Charlotte. Jason Knauf, communications secretary to the Cambridges, wrote the letter to media standards organisations in various countries.[259]\n\nIn May 2020, Kensington Palace said that the cover story of Tatler magazine titled \'Catherine the Great\' contained ""a swathe of inaccuracies and false misrepresentations"". Despite the palace\'s statement that most of the material was not given to them before publication, the magazine\'s editor-in-chief announced that he would stand behind the story as the palace had been aware of it for months.[260] In September 2020, after pressure from the couple\'s lawyers, the magazine removed remarks on the Duchess\'s family and other similar claims from the online version of the story.[261]\n\nTitles, styles, honours and arms\n\nTitles and styles\n\nRoyal monogram\n\nCatherine is, by marriage, a princess of the United Kingdom and entitled to the style of Royal Highness.[262] She is usually styled as ""Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Cambridge"".[263] When in Scotland, she is known as the Countess of Strathearn.[264] Northern Ireland is represented by a third title, Lady Carrickfergus.[263][a]\n\nHonours\n\nCommonwealth honours\n\nHonorary military appointments\n\nHonorific eponym\n\nAwards\n\nArms\n\nIn September 2013, the Queen granted a conjugal coat of arms to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, consisting of their individual arms displayed side by side, beneath a helm and coronet denoting the duke\'s status as grandson of the sovereign.[274] Below is shown the earlier grant of the duchess\'s personal arms, impaled with those of her husband.\n\nAncestry\n\nFour successive generations of the Duchess\'s ancestors had lived at Potternewton Hall Estate , near Leeds\n\nThe Duchess of Cambridge\'s father is Michael Middleton, son of Captain Peter Middleton, who, along with their forebears, were from Leeds, Yorkshire.[278][279] Her paternal great-grandmother Olive Middleton (n\xc3\xa9e Lupton) and her cousin Baroness von Schunck (n\xc3\xa9e Kate Lupton) were members of the Lupton family who are described as landed gentry and as such, were invited to the coronation of King George V in 1911.[280][281] Four successive generations of the Duchess\'s ancestors had lived at Potternewton Hall Estate, the family seat, including the Duchess\'s great-grandmother Olive Middleton, her father, politician Francis Martineau Lupton, his mother, educator Frances Lupton and her father, epidemiologist Dr Thomas Michael Greenhow.[282][283][284][285][286]\n\nThe Duchess\'s maternal ancestors, the Harrisons, were working-class labourers and miners from Sunderland and County Durham.[287] Ancestors through her maternal line include Sir Thomas Conyers, 9th Baronet (1731\xe2\x80\x931810), who was a descendant of King Edward IV through his illegitimate daughter Elizabeth Plantagenet.[288] Other paternal ancestors are Sir Thomas Fairfax (1475\xe2\x80\x931520) and his wife Anne Gascoigne, who was a descendant of King Edward III.[289][290]\n\nAuthored articles\n\nNotes\n\n^ Even with the title Lady Carrickfergus, she is still mostly referred to as the Duchess of Cambridge in Northern Ireland, as per given sources.\n\nReferences'"

"b'Back in 2011, Kate Middleton\'s sister, Pippa, became the world\'s most famous maid of honor when she attended to the Duchess of Cambridge during her wedding to Prince William.

And though fans are excited to tout the pair as BFFs, they still have a lot of bonding to go. Royal expert Katie Nicholl told InStyle that Meghan is independent and interested in creating her own friend group in London, but not with any disrespect to Kate at all.\n\nPlus, on a technical level, Kate ""is the future queen consort when William becomes king after his father, and would unlikely be an attending person to another royal bride,"" royal expert Marlene Koenig revealed. Middleton wasn\'t even a maid of honor at her own sister\'s wedding, so it\'s not a surprise she isn\'t one at Meghan\'s.\n\nJessica Mulroney\n\nGetty Images\n\nMeghan met her best friend and stylist, Jessica Mulroney, in 2011, around the time Markle moved to Toronto (Mulroney\'s home base) to film Suits, according to The Sun. Since then they\'ve bonded over yoga sessions and joint vacations.\n\nJessica and her husband, Ben Mulroney (son of former Canadian Prime Minister, Brian Mulroney), helped Meghan and Harry keep undercover after their romance first broke news. She also accompanied Meghan at the Invictus Games closing ceremony, hosted by Prince Harry, which took place in Toronto.\n\nMeghan\xe2\x80\x99s mother, Doria Ragland, Meghan, Jessica, and their friend Markus Anderson at the Invictus Games closing ceremony.

She reportedly helped Markle choose her wedding dress designer and is also making a custom piece for the big day.\n\nPriyanka Chopra\n\nThis content is imported from Instagram. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.\n\nThe Quantico actress and the Suits star first met at the ELLE Women in Television dinner in 2016. ""We bonded as actors,"" she told People of their friendship. ""We just became friends, like two girls would.""\n\nSince Meghan and Harry\'s relationship went public, Chopra has urged people to consider Markle as more than just the prince\'s girlfriend. She called Vanity Fair\'s profile of the actress ""just a little sexist"" because it mainly focused on Markle\'s relationship with Harry, and she shut down Wendy Williams when she described Markle as ""Prince Harry\'s girlfriend.""\n\nWhen Harper\'s BAZAAR Arabia asked her if she\'s going to be a bridesmaid at the royal wedding, Chopra teased, ""If you see me there, you\xe2\x80\x99ll know.""\n\nSerena Williams\n\nGetty Images\n\nThe star athlete first met Markle in 2014, at DIRECTV\'s Celebrity Beach Bowl, E! News reports. Meghan recalled in her former lifestyle site, The Tig, ""We hit it off immediately, taking pictures, laughing through the flag football game we were both playing in, and chatting not about tennis or acting, but about all the good old fashioned girly stuff. So began our friendship.""\n\nIn the following years, Markle supported Williams through her matches at competitions like the U.S. Open and Wimbledon (where she actually sat a few rows away from Pippa Middleton). Williams even contributed to a few blog posts to The Tig, according to E!.\n\n""She quickly became a confidante I would text when I was traveling, the friend I would rally around for her tennis matches, and the down to earth chick I was able to grab lunch with just a couple weeks ago in Toronto,"" E! says Markle wrote on The Tig, describing her friendship with Williams.\n\n""We are both the same age, have a penchant for hot sauces, and adore fashion, but what connects us more than those things is perhaps our belief in exceeding expectations\xe2\x80\x93our endless ambition,"" she added.\n\nThough Meghan unfortunately wasn\'t present at Williams\' nuptials to Reddit founder Alexis Ohanian in November 2017, there\'s still a chance the newlywed tennis champ could show up at Windsor Castle for Markle.\n\nSarah Rafferty or Gina Torres\n\nRafferty, Markle, and Torres promoting Suits Season 4 Getty Images\n\nMarkle\'s fellow Suits actresses may also be helping her ahead of the wedding. In August 2016, the bride-to-be posted an Instagram (which has now been deleted, like the rest of her social media accounts) dedicated to her costars, with the caption: ""Celebrating our friendship of six years and counting. So much deep love for these two women."" The former actress also nicknamed Rafferty her ""Suits sister wife.""\n\nAfter Harry and Meghan\'s relationship was confirmed in November 2016, Rafferty gave a brief response in an interview with the AP. ""I don\'t comment on my castmates\' personal lives, but of course, it\'s very exciting,"" she said. ""And I\'m very happy for her.""\n\nIn February 2017, tabloid site OK Magazine reported that Torres and her husband Laurence Fishburne (whom she divorced in November) had a double date with Markle and Harry.\n\nWhether or not Rafferty and Torres are in the bridal party, we can probably expect them to be at the ceremony, since the cast of Suits has reportedly nabbed royal wedding invitations. Plus, it would be a sweet reunion for the former costars, since Meghan\'s final Suits episode officially aired on April 25.\n\nThis content is created and maintained by a third party, and imported onto this page to help users provide their email addresses.

According to Pop Sugar, she dated The Cab frontman Alex DeLeon from 2008-09, and later based the breakup song \xe2\x80\x9cCatch Me\xe2\x80\x9d on him. Lovato also had brief flings with Trace Cyrus (Miley\xe2\x80\x99s older brother) in 2009 and Joe Jonas, her self-proclaimed \xe2\x80\x9cBFF,\xe2\x80\x9d in 2010.\n\nHer most notable relationship to date, however, has been with Valderrama, whom she dated from from 2010 to 2016. In an interview with Latina magazine, Lovato discussed what attracted her to the That 70\xe2\x80\x99s Show actor:\n\nWhen I dated white guys, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t as passionate as my relationship with Wilmer. Maybe that\xe2\x80\x99s just Wilmer. But I do believe that Latin people are just more expressive, more passionate with their emotions. He\xe2\x80\x99s very manly, and he can be stubborn like Latino men can, but he\xe2\x80\x99s protective and he cares so much and loves so hard. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been blessed enough to have him in my life, and not just as my man, but also my best friend.\n\nSince her breakup from Valderrama, Lovato\xe2\x80\x99s been seen with MMA fighter Guilherme \xe2\x80\x9cBomba\xe2\x80\x9d Vasconcelos and Abedini.\n\n3.

"b'Could baby number four be on the way for Queen Bey? The singer\xe2\x80\x99s fans seem convinced she is once again expecting! See their tweets on the matter and Beyonce\xe2\x80\x99s slim-fitting bodysuit below!\n\nDuring a July 15 performance in Paris, France, Beyonc\xc3\xa9, 36, was absolutely glowing! The singer looked phenomenal as she took to the stage in a chic white bodysuit, and a pair of denim shorts. Over her shoulders she slung a colorful sequin jacket, as she effortlessly danced around the stage. Despite this \xe2\x80\x93 fans were completely convinced: Bey is preggers again, and they were not afraid to let their opinions be heard.\n\nMembers of the Beyhive did NOT hesitate on calling their queen out via social media. In a series of tweets, fans demanded the singer to come clean about her potential baby news. \xe2\x80\x9cso when beyonc\xc3\xa9 gonna tell us she pregnant. i\xe2\x80\x99m waiting \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d said one fan on Twitter. \xe2\x80\x9cNaw Beyonc\xc3\xa9 is really pregnant again omg.

It seems like fans really have their minds made up, but let\xe2\x80\x99s not get too far ahead of ourselves, Beyonc\xc3\xa9 has YET to comment on the news herself at all! If the singer isn\xe2\x80\x99t pregnant, she\xe2\x80\x99s definitely letting this rumor ride this wave pretty far.\n\nThis wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the only recent instance from Beyonc\xc3\xa9 that had fans spouting pregnancy prophecies. In a fan video posted on July 8, Bey can be seen standing onstage rubbing her belly while performing at a concert. Hmmm \xe2\x80\x93 seems like a move from a mother-to-be if we\xe2\x80\x99ve ever seen one! Then, just several days later, Beyonc\xc3\xa9 whipped an ultra flowy dress out of her closet\xe2\x80\xa6.you know, the kind you throw on when you have something to hide. Very suspicious!\n\nIf Beyonc\xc3\xa9 did have another child on the way, it would be her fourth one, and a very close consecutive to her last time giving birth! Beyonc\xc3\xa9 welcomed twins, Rumi and Sir Carter into the world on June, 13 2017. This close succession of pregnancies seems to have fans confused, especially since Bey is currently on a joint tour with hubby Jay-Z and has live shows lined up for months to come!

"b'Katie Holmes has finally gone public with Jamie Foxx after a rumoured romance that became an open secret in Hollywood.\n\nBut while the public were wondering why it took them so long to confirm their relationship, it seems to stem back to her five-year marriage to Tom Cruise.\n\nMuch has been reported about their bizarre divorce - and how Katie literally fled the country to get herself and daughter Suri away - but the actress has never spoken publicly about life as part of TomKat.\n\nHere, we look back at the bizarre claims surrounding Tom\'s marriage rules for his wife...\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will auto-play soon 8 Cancel Play now\n\nScientology elders \'audition for wives\'\n\n(Image: Eyevine)\n\nAfter Tom\'s divorce from second wife Nicole Kidman, he began getting more into Scientology - the religious organisation he was introduced to by first wife Mimi Rogers in the late 1980s.\n\nAnd there have been claims that Katie - who fancied Tom as a teenager - wasn\'t the Mission Impossible star\'s first pick.\n\nAccording to the controversial book Going Clear: Scientology, Hollywood and the Prison Belief by Lawrence Wright, Tom invited Scientology elders to hold screen tests to find his next wife - a claim which the church\'s lawyers have denied.\n\nBut the author claimed a number of eligible Hollywood women were \'auditioned\' by the church for the role of Tom\'s next spouse, including Lindsay Lohan, Scarlett Johansson and Jessica Alba.\n\nNorwegian blonde Anette Iren Johansen said in 2015 that she\'d been among the auditionees and claimed she\'d been questioned later by a church elder about her sexual history - including whether she\'d ever had threesomes or sex with a woman.\n\nA spokesperson for the Church of Scientology told Mail Online at the time: ""There was no project, secret or otherwise, ever conducted by the Church to find a bride, via audition or otherwise, for any member.""\n\nMonitoring Katie\'s pregnancy\n\n(Image: WireImage)\n\nWhen TomKat announced they were expecting their first child together in October 2005, doctors criticised Cruise for buying his own at-home ultrasound machine so he could keep an eye on Katie\'s womb.\n\nTom confessed he\'d bought the high-tech equipment to use throughout his wife\'s pregnancy and said the couple would donate it to a hospital after she\'d given birth, but medical specialists slammed his decision.\n\nSome doctors warned that sonograms should only be carried out by certified technicians and only for medical purposes, as potential problems could be missed by untrained observers or the unborn child could be exposed to more sound waves than necessary.\n\nSilent childbirth\n\n(Image: <P>Pictured: Katie Holmes and Suri Cruise<P><B>Ref: SPL43985 120808 ...)\n\nBy far and away the strangest rule to come out of Tom and Katie\'s marriage was Cruise\'s insistence that his wife stay silent while she was giving birth to baby Suri.\n\nAccording to Scientologists, labouring women should avoid screaming, groaning or even talking lest their words cause trauma to their newborn.\n\nEven doctors and other staff attending the birth should refrain from speaking, according to Scientology founder L.

"b'\xe2\x80\x9cTwilight\xe2\x80\x9d fans have been eagerly awaiting for the day that stars Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart would get back together following their high profile break up. Despite a new article alleging the former co-stars are rekindling their romance, it looks like Robsten shippers will have to keep on dreaming, seeing as sources shut down the report as false.\n\nPattinson and Stewart began dating in 2009 after meeting on the set of the supernatural movie. The former couple experienced a brief break up in 2012 when the actress was caught cheating with her \xe2\x80\x9cSnow White and the Huntsman\xe2\x80\x9d director Rupert Sanders. Although the actors tried to work past the scandal, their relationship officially ended in 2013.\n\nA new report published by OK! claims Stewart is \xe2\x80\x9con the rocks\xe2\x80\x9d with her current girlfriend, Stella Maxwell, and has been spending time with her ex-boyfriend.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cKristen is angling to give things between them another go. She\xe2\x80\x99s hoping that Rob is serious when he says he\xe2\x80\x99s forgiven what happened back then,\xe2\x80\x9d an \xe2\x80\x9cinsider\xe2\x80\x9d told the tabloid.\n\nThe OK! \xe2\x80\x9cinsider\xe2\x80\x9d went on to claim there is still a spark between the former couple and their friends are beginning to question if they will get back together. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re trying to keep it low-key, but there\xe2\x80\x99s still chemistry there. People in their circles are starting to wonder if they\xe2\x80\x99re considering a reconciliation.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHowever, a source told Gossip Cop the article is nonsense and revealed Stewart and Pattinson are not considering a reconciliation.\n\nFollowing Pattinson and Stewart\xe2\x80\x99s split, the stars moved on to other people. The actor began dating British singer FKA Twigs in 2014. The two were briefly engaged before news of their break up began to surface in 2017.\n\nTowards the end of that year, Pattinson was accompanied by a mystery woman to Seth MacFarlane\xe2\x80\x99s annual holiday party. At the time, sources told Us Weekly the two didn\xe2\x80\x99t attempt to hide they were together and held hands throughout the night.\n\nMeanwhile, Stewart has been in a relationship with Maxwell since December 2016. The two were most recently photographed enjoying a cozy date night on March 21 in Los Angeles.\n\nWhile fans of Pattinson and Stewart are still hoping the pair will get back together, it looks like the exes have their sights set on other people.\n\nPhoto: Jason Merritt/Getty Images'"

"b'\n\n\n\nIf a picture speaks a thousand words, then the Instagram accounts of Jennifer Lopez and boyfriend Alex Rodriguez could tell one epic story. Within hours of each other on Jan. 24, the former Yankee slugger posted a photo of a cryptic quote: \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s nothing wrong with making a mistake, what\xe2\x80\x99s wrong is not making the effort to make it right,\xe2\x80\x9d and the Shades of Blue star shared a photo of a gigantic bouquet of flowers Alex had sent her. The next day, she uploaded a selfie and captioned the photo, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all in God\xe2\x80\x99s hands always,\xe2\x80\x9d along with the hashtag #letgoandletgod. According to an insider, \xe2\x80\x9cThat was aimed directly at Alex.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHollywood\xe2\x80\x99s hottest duo is on the verge of flaming out. Jennifer, 48, is privately questioning her relationship with her boyfriend of nearly a year after learning he\xe2\x80\x99s still in touch with former fling Lauren Hunter, a fitness model, who last year claimed in an interview that Alex, 42, had been sexting her for months \xe2\x80\x94 including while he was dating J.Lo. Recently, \xe2\x80\x9csomeone went to Jennifer with new details that Alex was still texting with Lauren, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what made Jennifer lose it,\xe2\x80\x9d the insider tells In Touch. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course, he said it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t physical, and maybe it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t, but in Jennifer\xe2\x80\x99s book, that\xe2\x80\x99s still cheating. They were head-over-heels in love and planning to get engaged. Now Alex\xe2\x80\x99s actions have jeopardized everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe damage runs deep. Jennifer, who\xe2\x80\x99s endured three failed marriages, \xe2\x80\x9cwas heartbroken to hear that Alex was talking to Lauren,\xe2\x80\x9d says the insider. \xe2\x80\x9cEven though they didn\xe2\x80\x99t meet in person, Jennifer considered it a betrayal. Now she has friends and family watching out for her best interests, which means checking in and asking about Alex\xe2\x80\x99s antics.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShe has good reason to worry. Last June, a month after Jennifer and Alex made their red carpet debut at the Met Gala in NYC, Lauren claimed in a bombshell interview that she was in frequent contact with the ex-athlete, whom she met at an Equinox gym in 2011. \xe2\x80\x9cA week before his relationship with Jennifer was announced, he was asking me to go to Miami,\xe2\x80\x9d she claimed. \xe2\x80\x9cHe never even mentioned her.\xe2\x80\x9d Lauren also alleged that Alex (who has kids Natasha, 13, and Ella, 9, with ex-wife Cynthia Scurtis) cheated on then-girlfriend Cameron Diaz with her in 2011. Jennifer \xe2\x80\x9cwould be an idiot to believe he\xe2\x80\x99d be faithful,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. She also called Jennifer too vanilla for him. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think he\xe2\x80\x99s sexually attracted to her,\xe2\x80\x9d she dished. \xe2\x80\x9cIn bed\xe2\x80\xa6 he\xe2\x80\x99s probably picturing me.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nJennifer, mom to nine-year-old twins Max and Emme with ex Marc Anthony, turned a blind eye to the initial interview. Now, she\xe2\x80\x99s not sure what to believe. \xe2\x80\x9cJennifer\xe2\x80\x99s still on the fence,\xe2\x80\x9d says the insider. \xe2\x80\x9cShe can either cut her losses and walk away from the relationship, or she can fight for it.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\n\nWhat happens when you eat and exercise like celeb royalty for a fortnight? One writer investigates...\n\nWords by Lamya Tilmatine\n\nKim Kardashian has been on a fitness mission of late and, frankly, has never looked better.\n\nHer recent body debut at the CFDA Fashion Awards last month showcased a lighter, tighter and fitter Kim \xe2\x80\x93 arms of envy I tell you \xe2\x80\x93 to the point where she may actually de-throne Khloe\xe2\x80\x99s revenge-body title\xe2\x80\xa6\n\nI decided I wanted in.\n\nLet\xe2\x80\x99s get one thing straight from the off; I am not trying to \xe2\x80\x98get\xe2\x80\x99 a body like Kim\xe2\x80\x99s, nor do I endorse her stance on Instagram marketing and promoting certain lollipops.\n\nHowever, I have definitely seen her eating slices of cake and McDonald\xe2\x80\x99s as well as a variety of nutritious meals, showing that she must have a well-balanced outlook on food.\n\nI looked into her diet plan and found out that she was following the Atkins 40 diet and getting great results at a healthy rate. Her trainer Alcantara explained to People that it\xe2\x80\x99s all about clean eating and strength training.\n\nSounds promising \xe2\x80\x93 so what does it actually entail?\n\nWho is it for?\n\nPeople who want to lose weight or those that just want a healthier lifestyle and reign in their intake simple carbohydrates.\n\nWhat this is also about is achieving a fitter version of myself that I can sustain without starvation.\n\nWhat is the Atkins 20/40 Diet?\n\nThere are two options: Atkins 20 or Atkins 40, and the numbers are the total net carbohydrates you can have in a day, with 20 being stricter on the carb intake but quicker in weight-loss in comparison to 40.\n\nLike the old Atkins, you are limiting your carbohydrate intake, cutting out sugars and processed foods, eating high protein, vegetables and healthy fats to curb those hunger pangs.\n\nThe science behind the diet is quite simple: eating foods that are high in carbohydrates makes your body produce more glucose and insulin. Glucose is your body\xe2\x80\x99s first point of energy that it uses, leaving stored fat just that, stored fat. Make sense?\n\nSo, the decreased intake of carbs means your body is pushed to burn fat for fuel hence the weight loss. Still with me?\n\nIs it the same as the Ketogenic diet?\n\nThere are similarities in the beginning as your low carb diet means that your body goes into Ketosis but after that, you\xe2\x80\x99re allowed to increase levels of healthy carbs in your diet which essentially means ketosis will decrease too.\n\nWhat you can eat on Atkins 20 and 40\n\nPoultry, seafood, dairy (like yoghurt and cheese), vegetables (particularly your greens), healthy fats from nut and seeds, avocados, almond/olive/coconut oil.\n\nAlso, you do eat carbohydrates though from healthier sources like legumes, whole grains and fruits, but all under a net total of 20g/40g depending on what you choose to do.\n\nI opted for Atkins 40 as it\xe2\x80\x99s recommended to those who want to shift a smaller amount of weight. If it works for Kimmy (who isn\xe2\x80\x99t a stranger to a treat or two) then I\xe2\x80\x99m game.\n\nThe workout\n\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve always been a bit of a gym bunny but have never gotten the right cardio/strength training ratio to create the muscle definition I want. I tend to do more of one or the other, which means I get quite slim without any definition or I bulk up (sad emoji).\n\nSo I got myself a personal trainer, explained my fitness goals: defined arms, firm abs and strong hamstrings. Some people love morning workouts as it boasts optimum fat burning but I\xe2\x80\x99d rather the extra 2 hours in bed and workout in the early evening.\n\nKeep scrolling to see what it\xe2\x80\x99s like eating like Kim Kardashian for two weeks \xe2\x80\x93 will I get the results or will it just be another fad diet?\n\nThe meal plan\n\nBelow is what I ate during the first week of the plan, following a similar approach in week two.\n\nMonday\n\nBreakfast: poached eggs with spinach and a drizzle of olive oil.\n\nLunch: grilled chicken, broccoli, spring onions, spinach, kale and homemade chilli sauce.\n\nDinner: baked salmon with a grilled vegetable medley.\n\nSnacks: coffee with cinnamon, turmeric tea x2 and six almonds.\n\nHow I felt at the end of the day: Hungry! But I drank loads of water and tea to suppress my sugar cravings \xe2\x80\x93 but not having something sweet has proven to be tough on day one.\n\nTuesday\n\nBreakfast: \xe2\x80\x98Noatmeal\xe2\x80\x98 \xe2\x80\x93 made with almond flour and shredded coconut with a spoon of peanut butter.\n\nLunch: one boiled egg, sliced cucumbers, sweet corn, red peppers, green olives, rocket salad with turmeric and a teaspoon of olive oil.\n\nDinner: Grilled chicken breast seasoned with Moroccan herbs and spices, grilled onions, peas and green peppers.\n\nSnacks: Celery, six almonds, two cups of tea and two litres of water.\n\nWednesday\n\nBreakfast: I had no time to cook so I boiled an egg with one Weetabix biscuit along with organic almond milk and coffee.\n\nLunch: one boiled egg, sliced cucumbers, beetroot, olives, spinach, green peppers topped with cashew nuts and a slice of avocado.\n\nDinner: cod fillet with homemade parsley sauce, cauliflower mash, leafy rocket salad. Yum!\n\nSnacks: Nak\xe2\x80\x99d bar, coffee, turmeric tea, English breakfast tea. And of course, a lot of water!\n\nThursday\n\nBreakfast: one poached egg on a bed of spinach with an apple, celery, cucumber, mint and kale smoothie.\n\nLunch: Tuna salad with mixed leaves, olives, onions and beetroot.\n\nDinner: Cod fillet with mushroom and broccoli\n\nSnacks: Nak\xe2\x80\x99d bar, turmeric tea, six almonds, red pepper slices.\n\nSpeaking to a personal trainer I got some advice on my workouts, he advised I focused on HIIT sessions in combination with strength training (which I have been doing). However, after a hard core session with him I realised I could push myself even more.\n\nAlready, I train five to six times a week \xe2\x80\x93 the ideal to see a real difference \xe2\x80\x93 and after a week my legs feel more defined, my core feels stronger but my arms are a bit slow at catching up.\n\nFriday\n\nBreakfast: Mini coconut pancakes with peanut butter and coffee.\n\nLunch: Chicken and broccoli soup.\n\nDinner: Cod fillet with peas and a mixed cabbage salad topped with homemade mayonnaise.\n\nSnacks: Turmeric tea, six almonds and a slither of cake (I caved).\n\nThe weekend was more of the same but with Nutella pancakes for brunch on Sunday (cheeky I know).\n\nSome may argue that the rotation of protein based meals can be boring, but I found that having a structure to start with was much easier to follow, especially with a hectic work schedule.\n\nThe verdict\n\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve realised that Kim\xe2\x80\x99s diet has the same principles of a keto diet; Ketosis does occur, but at a healthier pace that I found more sustainable. She allows for oatmeal pancakes and the odd treat.\n\nBut, as seen on her Instagram account, her diet mainly consists of protein in the form of chicken and fish, accompanied by an array of vegetables. I found this hard at first so I made my meals richer in protein where I could.\n\nKKW has an advantage though; she reportedly has a chef that creates personalised meals guided by her personal trainer. But we have the internet with endless recipes, advice and inspiration \xe2\x80\x93 we can do this!\n\nResults so far? I\xe2\x80\x99ve lost two pounds \xe2\x80\x93 but, more importantly, my sugar cravings have all but completely gone. This approach gets the thumbs up from me.'"

His father, Homer George Gere (born 1922),[1] was an insurance agent for the Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company and had originally intended to become a minister.[7] Gere is their eldest son and second child.[1]\n\nHis paternal great-grandfather George Lane Gere (1848\xe2\x80\x931932) had changed the spelling of the surname from ""Geer"".[1] The direct paternal ancestor is George Geer along with his brother Thomas from Heavitree, Devon, England who settled in Connecticut Colony in 1638.[1][8] Both of his parents were Mayflower descendants; Gere\'s ancestors include Pilgrims Francis Eaton, John Billington, George Soule, Richard Warren, Degory Priest, Francis Cooke, and William Brewster.[1]\n\nIn 1967, Gere graduated from North Syracuse Central High School, where he excelled at gymnastics and music and played the trumpet.[7] He attended the University of Massachusetts Amherst on a gymnastics scholarship, majoring in philosophy; after two years, he left and did not graduate.[7][9]\n\nCareer\n\nStage\n\nGere first worked professionally at the Seattle Repertory Theatre and the Provincetown Playhouse on Cape Cod in 1969, where he starred in Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead. His first major acting role was in the original London stage version of Grease, in 1973.[7] Gere was one of the first notable Hollywood actors to play a homosexual character, starring as a gay Holocaust victim in the 1979 Broadway production of Bent; Gere\'s performance earned him a Theatre World Award.\n\nFilm\n\nHe began appearing in Hollywood films in the mid-1970s. Originally cast in a starring role in The Lords of Flatbush (1974), he was replaced after fighting with another star of the film, Sylvester Stallone. He played a small but memorable part in Looking for Mr. Goodbar (1977) and starred in director Terrence Malick\'s well-reviewed drama Days of Heaven (1978).[7] The crime drama American Gigolo (1980) significantly boosted his profile and the romantic drama An Officer and a Gentleman (1982) (co-starring Debra Winger) cemented Gere\'s ascent to stardom, grossing almost $130 million[10] and winning two Academy Awards out of six nominations;[11] Gere himself received his first Golden Globe Award nomination.[12]\n\nFor the remainder of the 1980s, Gere appeared in films of varying critical and commercial reception.[13][14] His career rebounded with the releases of Internal Affairs (1990) and Pretty Woman (1990), the latter of which earned him his second Golden Globe Award nomination.[15] The 1990s saw Gere star in successful films including Sommersby (1993) (opposite Jodie Foster), Primal Fear (1996) and Runaway Bride (1999) (which reunited him with his Pretty Woman co-star Julia Roberts).[13] He also took a leading role in the action thriller The Jackal (1997), playing former IRA militant Declan Mulqueen; Gere affected an Irish accent for the role.[16]\n\nGere was named People magazine\'s ""Sexiest Man Alive"" in 1999. Not long thereafter, all in the same year, he appeared in the hit films The Mothman Prophecies (2002), Unfaithful (2002) and the Academy Award-winning musical film adaptation Chicago (2002),[7] for which he won his first Golden Globe Award. Gere\'s ballroom dancing drama Shall We Dance? (2004) was also a solid performer that grossed $170 million worldwide.[17] His next film, the book-to-screen adaptation Bee Season (2005), was a commercial failure.[18] Gere went on to co-star with Jesse Eisenberg and Terrence Howard in The Hunting Party (2007), a thriller in which he played a journalist in Bosnia. He next appeared with Christian Bale, Heath Ledger and Cate Blanchett in Todd Haynes\' semi-biographical film about Bob Dylan, I\'m Not There (2007); Gere was one of six actors to portray a variation of Dylan.\n\nGere co-starred with Diane Lane in the romantic drama Nights in Rodanthe (2008). The film was widely panned by critics[19] (making #74 on The Times Worst Films of 2008 list),[20] but grossed over $84 million worldwide.[21] The film is Gere\'s most recent to have been produced entirely by a major film studio. Gere has expressed belief that his politics regarding China, the latter an important financial resource for major studios, have made him persona non grata within Hollywood.[22]\n\nGere embraced his apparent exile from Hollywood, appearing in independent features that garnered some of the best reviews of his career.[14] He was notably singled out for portraying businessman Robert Miller in Arbitrage (2012), earning his fourth Golden Globe Award nomination. Among many positive reviews,[23] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone cited Gere\'s performance as ""too good to ignore"" and ""an implosive tour de force"".[24] Lou Lumenick of the New York Post further wrote ""Richard Gere gives the best performance of his career"".[25][26] Also in 2012, Gere received the Golden Starfish Award for Lifetime Achievement from the Hamptons International Film Festival and the Career Achievement Award from the Hollywood Film Awards.[27][28] He had earlier received an award from the 34th Cairo International Film Festival in December 2010.[29]\n\nGere made a notable departure from his traditional screen persona with Norman: The Moderate Rise and Tragic Fall of a New York Fixer (2016). The political drama (written and directed by Academy Award-nominee Joseph Cedar) saw him portray Norman Oppenheimer, a ""small time Jewish \'fixer\'"". Gere himself described the character as an embodiment of the ""sides of us we know are annoying and needy"".[30] His portrayal of Oppenheimer was called ""consistently, completely fascinating"" by RogerEbert.com[31] and was singled out as a worthy Academy Award contender by Variety.[32]\n\nMusic and dance\n\nGere is an accomplished musician, composing and performing the Pretty Woman piano theme and a guitar solo in Runaway Bride. He learned tap dance for his role as lawyer Billy Flynn in Chicago[33] and karate for An Officer and a Gentleman.[34]\n\nPersonal life and activism\n\nGere had on-again/off-again relationships with actress Penelope Milford in 1971\xe2\x80\x9378[35] and painter Sylvia Martins in 1978\xe2\x80\x9386.[36] During those years, he was sporadically linked with Tuesday Weld,[37] Carole Mallory,[38] Dawn Steel,[39] Loree Rodkin,[40] Diane von Furstenberg,[41] Barbara Carrera,[42] and Barbra Streisand.[43] He was accused of having affairs with Priscilla Presley and Kim Basinger in tell-all books written by Presley\'s ex-boyfriend Michael Edwards[44] and Basinger\'s ex-husband Ron Snyder.[45] Gere has also reportedly dated Laura Bailey,[46] Tina Chow,[47] Dalila Di Lazzaro[48] and Padma Lakshmi.[49]\n\nGere was married to supermodel Cindy Crawford from 1991 to 1995. In November 2002, he married model and actress Carey Lowell.[50] They have a son, Homer James Jigme Gere, who was born in February 2000 and is named for his grandfathers as well as the Tibetan name Jigme.[7][51]\n\nIn September 2013, the two separated after 11 years of marriage. The couple spent three years in highly contested divorce proceedings in New York County Supreme Court.[52] The case was settled in October 2016.[53]\n\nIn early April 2018, he married Spanish activist Alejandra Silva.[54] In August 2018, the couple announced that they were expecting their first child.[55][56] Their son, Alexander, was born in February 2019.[57][58] In April 2020, the birth of their second son was reported.[59][60]\n\nGere speaking about the Dalai Lama in 2000\n\nGere was raised Methodist.[61][62] His interest in Buddhism began when he was in his 20s.[63] He first studied Zen Buddhism[63] under Kyozan Joshu Sasaki. After having studied Zen for five or six years,[63] in 1978 he traveled with the Brazilian painter Sylvia Martins[64] to Nepal, where he met many Tibetan monks and lamas.[64] He then met the 14th Dalai Lama in India[63] and became a practicing Tibetan Buddhist of the Gelugpa school of Tibetan Buddhism[63] and an active supporter of the Dalai Lama.[7] Gere regularly visits Dharamshala, the headquarters of the Tibetan government-in-exile.[65]\n\nGere is also an advocate for human rights in Tibet. He is a co-founder of the Tibet House US, creator of the Gere Foundation and Chairman of the Board of Directors for the International Campaign for Tibet. Because he supports the Tibetan Independence Movement, he is permanently banned from entering the People\'s Republic of China.[66][67]\n\nIn 1993, Gere was banned from being an Academy Award presenter after he denounced the Chinese government in his capacity while announcing the nominees.[68][69]\n\nIn September 2007, Gere called for the boycott of the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games to put pressure on China to make Tibet independent. He starred in a Free Tibet-themed Lancia commercial featuring the Lancia Delta.[70] On June 27, 2011, Gere meditated in Borobudur Temple,[71] in Indonesia.\n\nGere actively supports Survival International, an organization dedicated to protecting the rights and lands of tribal peoples throughout the world.[64]\n\nHe contributed some of his writing for the book, We Are One: A Celebration of Tribal Peoples, released in October 2009.[72] Gere discussed the persecution and loss of land of the Jummas as an example of a tragic story that repeats itself in different continents of the world, calling attention to the crime against their peaceful culture and how it reflects on humankind\'s own relationship with nature and capacity to survive.[73] The royalties from the sale of the book go to the indigenous rights organization, Survival International.\n\nGere campaigns for ecological causes and AIDS awareness. He currently serves on the board of directors for Healing the Divide, an organization that supports global initiatives to promote peace, justice and understanding.[74] He helped to establish the AIDS Care Home, a residential facility in India for women and children with AIDS, and also supports campaigns for AIDS awareness and education in that country. In 1999, he created the Gere Foundation India Trust to support a variety of humanitarian programs in India.[75]\n\nOn April 15, 2007, Gere appeared at an AIDS awareness rally in Jaipur, India. During a live news conference to promote condom use among truck drivers, he embraced Bollywood superstar Shilpa Shetty, dipped her, and kissed her several times on the cheek. As a result of that gesture, a local court ordered the arrest of Gere and Shetty, finding them in violation of public obscenity laws. Gere has said the controversy was ""manufactured by a small hard-line political party."" About a month later, a two-judge bench headed by the Chief Justice of India, K. G. Balakrishnan, described the case as ""frivolous"" and believed that such complaints (against celebrities) were filed for ""cheap publicity"" and have brought a bad name to the country. They ruled that Gere would remain free to enter the country.[76]\n\nDespite not being vegetarian, Gere has been erroneously included on some lists of famous vegetarians.[77][78][79]\n\nIn 2016, he endorsed Hillary Clinton for president and donated $2,700 to her campaign.[80]\n\nIn 2016 during the TaorminaFilmFest opening night dedicated to Homeless People he launched the campaign #HomelessZero, promoted by fio.PSD, with the spot ""#HomelessZero""\n\nHonors and awards\n\nIn 1995, he was the President of the Jury at the 19th Moscow International Film Festival.[81]\n\nOn May 17, 2012, Albanian President, Bamir Topi awarded the ""Medal of Gratitude"" to Richard Gere with the citation: ""With gratitude and honor outstanding personality of the world art, great humanist and activist for the protection of human rights, which unmasked and the American public made known, and further, inhuman crimes, ethnic cleansing in Kosovo, in 1999, the Serbian military machine against the Albanian civilian population living in its land"".[82] On February 16, 2012, the George Eastman Museum honored Gere with the George Eastman Award for distinguished contribution to the art of film.[83]\n\nPolitical views\n\nIn 2010, Gere stated that the war in Iraq was not supported by the American people and that the George W. Bush administration ""bullied"" Americans into the decision.[84] He called George W. Bush a ""very poor president"".[85]\n\n""I\'m very sorry about what the U.S. has done in Iraq. This war has been a tragedy for everyone. I hope that the people of Iraq can rebuild their country,"" Gere said in a press conference held on the sidelines of the 34th Cairo International Film Festival.[86]\n\nGere stated that he was no longer welcome to participate in mainstream Hollywood films after criticizing the Chinese government and calling for a boycott of the Summer Olympics in Beijing.[87][88]\n\nIn 2017, Gere criticized Benjamin Netanyahu\'s policies on the Palestinians and Israel\'s expansion of settlements in the occupied West Bank, stating that ""Settlements are such an absurd provocation and, certainly in the international sense, completely illegal\xe2\x80\x94and they are certainly not part of the program of someone who wants a genuine peace process.""[89]\n\nFilmography\n\nFilm\n\nTelevision\n\nAwards and nominations'"

In reality, Kardashian publicly supported her husband. Later, West did admit he thought Kardashian would leave him.\n\n""There was a moment where I felt like after TMZ, maybe a week after that, I felt like the energy levels were low, and I called different family members and was asking, you know, \'Was Kim thinking about leaving me after TMZ?\'"" he told The New York Times last month. ""So that was a real conversation.""\n\nWest also referred to Kardashian\'s decision to stick by him in his son ""Wouldn\'t Leave,"" in which he raps, \xe2\x80\x9cTold her she could leave me now/But she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t leave.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWest and Kardashian have been married since 2014 and share three children, 5-year-old North, 2-year-old Saint and 6-month-old Chicago.\n\nPhoto credit: Getty'"

For other uses, see Shapeshifter (disambiguation)\n\nThe ability to physically transform through an inherent ability, divine intervention or generic tendencies\n\n""The giant Galligantua and the wicked old magician transform the duke\'s daughter into a white hind ."" by Arthur Rackham\n\nIn mythology, folklore and speculative fiction, shapeshifting is the ability to physically transform through an inherently superhuman ability, divine intervention, demonic manipulation, sorcery, spells or having inherited the ability. The idea of shapeshifting is in the oldest forms of totemism and shamanism, as well as the oldest existent literature and epic poems such as the Epic of Gilgamesh and the Iliad. The concept remains a common trope in modern fantasy, children\'s literature and popular culture.\n\nFolklore and mythology [ edit ]\n\n1722 German woodcut of a werewolf transforming\n\nPopular shapeshifting creatures in folklore are werewolves and vampires (mostly of European, Canadian, and Native American/early American origin), the huli jing of East Asia (including the Japanese kitsune and Korean kumiho), and the gods, goddesses, and demons of numerous mythologies, such as the Norse Loki or the Greek Proteus. Shapeshifting to the form of a wolf is specifically known as lycanthropy, and such creatures who undergo such change are called lycanthropes. Therianthropy is the more general term for human-animal shifts, but it is rarely used in that capacity. It was also common for deities to transform mortals into animals and plants.\n\nOther terms for shapeshifters include metamorph, the Navajo skin-walker, mimic, and therianthrope. The prefix ""were-,"" coming from the Old English word for ""man"" (masculine rather than generic), is also used to designate shapeshifters; despite its root, it is used to indicate female shapeshifters as well.\n\nWhile the popular idea of a shapeshifter is of a human being who turns into something else, there are numerous stories about animals that can transform themselves as well.[1]\n\nExamples of shapeshifting in classical literature include many examples in Ovid\'s Metamorphoses, Circe\'s transforming of Odysseus\' men to pigs in Homer\'s The Odyssey, and Apuleius\'s Lucius becoming a donkey in The Golden Ass. Proteus was noted among the gods for his shapeshifting; both Menelaus and Aristaeus seized him to win information from him, and succeeded only because they held on during his various changes. Nereus told Heracles where to find the Apples of the Hesperides for the same reason.\n\nThe Titan Metis, the first wife of Zeus and the mother of the goddess Athena, was believed to be able to change her appearance into anything she wanted. In one story, she was so proud, that her husband, Zeus, tricked her into changing into a fly. He then swallowed her because he feared that he and Metis would have a son who would be more powerful than Zeus himself. Metis, however, was already pregnant. She stayed alive inside his head and built armor for her daughter. The banging of her metalworking made Zeus have a headache, so Hephaestus clove his head with an axe. Athena sprang from her father\'s head, fully grown, and in battle armor.\n\nIn Greek mythology, the transformation is often a punishment from the gods to humans who crossed them.\n\nZeus transformed King Lycaon and his children into wolves (hence lycanthropy) as a punishment for either killing Zeus\' children or serving him the flesh of Lycaon\'s own murdered son Nyctimus, depending on the exact version of the myth.\n\nAres assigned Alectryon to keep watch for the other gods during his affair with Aphrodite, but Alectryon fell asleep, leading to their discovery and humiliation that morning. Ares turned Alectryon into a rooster, which always crows to signal the morning.\n\nDemeter transformed Ascalabus into a lizard for mocking her sorrow and thirst during her search for her daughter Persephone. She also turned King Lyncus into a lynx for trying to murder her prophet Triptolemus.\n\nAthena transformed Arachne into a spider for challenging her as a weaver and/or weaving a tapestry that insulted the gods. She also turned Nyctimene into an owl, though in this case it was an act of mercy, as the girl wished to hide from the daylight out of shame from being raped by her father.\n\nArtemis transformed Actaeon into a stag for spying on her bathing, and he was later devoured by his own hunting dogs.\n\nGalanthis was transformed into a weasel or cat after interfering in Hera\'s plans to hinder the birth of Heracles.\n\nAtalanta and Hippomenes were turned into lions after making love in a temple dedicated to Zeus or Cybele.\n\nIo was a priestess of Hera in Argos, a nymph who was raped by Zeus, who changed her into a heifer to escape detection.\n\nHera punished young Tiresias by transforming him into a woman and, seven years later, back into a man.\n\nKing Tereus, his wife Procne and her sister Philomela were all turned into birds (a hoopoe, a swallow and a nightingale respectively), after Tereus raped Philomela and cut out her tongue, and in revenge she and Procne served him the flesh of his murdered son Itys.\n\nWhile the Greek gods could use transformation punitively \xe2\x80\x93 such as Medusa, turned to a monster for having sexual intercourse with Poseidon in Athena\'s temple \xe2\x80\x93 even more frequently, the tales using it are of amorous adventure. Zeus repeatedly transformed himself to approach mortals as a means of gaining access:[2]\n\nDana\xc3\xab as a shower of gold\n\nEuropa as a bull\n\nLeda as a swan\n\nGanymede, as an eagle\n\nAlcmene as her husband Amphitryon\n\nHera as a cuckoo\n\nLeto as a quail\n\nSemele as a mortal shepherd\n\nIo, as a cloud\n\nNemesis (Goddess of retribution) transformed into a goose to escape Zeus\' advances, but he turned into a swan. She later bore the egg in which Helen of Troy was found.\n\nVertumnus transformed himself into an old woman to gain entry to Pomona\'s orchard; there, he persuaded her to marry him.\n\nIn other tales, the woman appealed to other gods to protect her from rape, and was transformed (Daphne into laurel, Cornix into a crow). Unlike Zeus and other gods\' shapeshifting, these women were permanently metamorphosed.\n\nIn one tale, Demeter transformed herself into a mare to escape Poseidon, but Poseidon counter-transformed himself into a stallion to pursue her, and succeeded in the rape. Caenis, having been raped by Poseidon, demanded of him that she be changed to a man. He agreed, and she became Caeneus, a form he never lost, except, in some versions, upon death.\n\nAs a final reward from the gods for their hospitality, Baucis and Philemon were transformed, at their deaths, into a pair of trees.\n\nIn some variants of the tale of Narcissus, he is turned into a narcissus flower.\n\nSometimes metamorphoses transformed objects into humans. In the myths of both Jason and Cadmus, one task set to the hero was to sow dragon\'s teeth; on being sown, they would metamorphose into belligerent warriors, and both heroes had to throw a rock to trick them into fighting each other to survive. Deucalion and Pyrrha repopulated the world after a flood by throwing stones behind them; they were transformed into people. Cadmus is also often known to have transformed into a dragon or serpent towards the end of his life. Pygmalion fell in love with Galatea, a statue he had made. Aphrodite had pity on him and transformed the stone to a living woman.\n\nBritish and Irish [ edit ]\n\nFairies, witches, and wizards were all noted for their shapeshifting ability. Not all fairies could shapeshift, and some were limited to changing their size, as with the spriggans, and others to a few forms and other fairies might have only the appearance of shapeshifting, through their power, called ""glamour,"" to create illusions.[3] But others, such as the Hedley Kow, could change to many forms, and both human and supernatural wizards were capable of both such changes, and inflicting them on others.[4]\n\nWitches could turn into hares and in that form steal milk and butter.[5]\n\nMany British fairy tales, such as Jack the Giant Killer and The Black Bull of Norroway, feature shapeshifting.\n\nCeltic mythology [ edit ]\n\nPwyll was transformed by Arawn into Arawn\'s own shape, and Arawn transformed himself into Pwyll\'s, so that they could trade places for a year and a day.\n\nLlwyd ap Cil Coed transformed his wife and attendants into mice to attack a crop in revenge; when his wife is captured, he turned himself into three clergymen in succession to try to pay a ransom.\n\nMath fab Mathonwy and Gwydion transform flowers into a woman named Blodeuwedd, and when she betrays her husband Lleu Llaw Gyffes, who is transformed into an eagle, they transform her again, into an owl.\n\nGilfaethwy committed rape with help from his brother Gwydion. Both were transformed into animals, for one year each. Gwydion was transformed into a stag, sow and wolf, and Gilfaethwy into a hind, boar and she-wolf. Each year, they had a child. Math turned the three young animals into boys.\n\nGwion, having accidentally taken some of the wisdom potion that Ceridwen was brewing for her son, fled from her through a succession of changes that she answered with changes of her own, ending with his being eaten, a grain of corn, by her as a hen. She became pregnant, and he was reborn in a new form, as Taliesin.\n\nTales abound about the selkie, a seal that can remove its skin to make contact with humans for only a short amount of time before it must return to the sea. Clan MacColdrum of Uist\'s foundation myths include a union between the founder of the clan and a shapeshifting selkie.[6] Another such creature is the Scottish selkie, which needs its sealskin to regain its form. In The Great Silkie of Sule Skerry the (male) selkie seduces a human woman. Such stories surrounding these creatures are usually romantic tragedies.\n\nScottish mythology features shapeshifters, which allows the various creatures to trick, deceive, hunt, and kill humans. Water spirits such as the each-uisge, which inhabit lochs and waterways in Scotland, were said to appear as a horse or a young man.[4] Other tales include kelpies who emerge from lochs and rivers in the disguise of a horse or woman in order to ensnare and kill weary travelers. Tam Lin, a man captured by the Queen of the Fairies is changed into all manner of beasts before being rescued. He finally turned into a burning coal and was thrown into a well, whereupon he reappeared in his human form. The motif of capturing a person by holding him through all forms of transformation is a common thread in folktales.[7]\n\nPerhaps the best-known Irish myth is that of Aoife who turned her stepchildren, the Children of Lir, into swans to be rid of them. Likewise, in the Tochmarc \xc3\x89ta\xc3\xadne, Fuamnach jealously turns \xc3\x89ta\xc3\xadn into a butterfly. The most dramatic example of shapeshifting in Irish myth is that of Tuan mac Cairill, the only survivor of Parthol\xc3\xb3n\'s settlement of Ireland. In his centuries long life he became successively a stag, a wild boar, a hawk and finally a salmon prior to being eaten and (as in the Wooing of \xc3\x89ta\xc3\xadn) reborn as a human.\n\nThe P\xc3\xbaca is a Celtic faery, and also a deft shapeshifter. He can transform into many different, terrifying forms.\n\nSadhbh, the wife of the famous hero Fionn mac Cumhaill, was changed into a deer by the druid Fer Doirich when she spurned his amorous interests.\n\nNorse [ edit ]\n\nIn the Lokasenna, Odin and Loki taunt each other with having taken the form of females and nursing offspring to which they had given birth. A 13th-century Edda relates Loki taking the form of a mare to bear Odin\'s steed Sleipnir which was the fastest horse ever to exist, and also the form of a she-wolf to bear Fenrir.[8]\n\nSvipdagr angered Odin, who turned him into a dragon. Despite his monstrous appearance, his lover, the goddess Freyja, refused to leave his side. When the warrior Hadding found and slew Svipdagr, Freyja cursed him to be tormented by a tempest and shunned like the plague wherever he went.[citation needed] In the Hyndlulj\xc3\xb3\xc3\xb0, Freyja transformed her prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9 \xc3\x93ttar into a boar to conceal him. She also possessed a cloak of falcon feathers that allowed her to transform into a falcon, which Loki borrowed on occasion.\n\nThe Volsunga saga contains many shapeshifting characters. Siggeir\'s mother changed into a wolf to help torture his defeated brothers-in-law with slow and ignominious deaths. When one, Sigmund, survived, he and his nephew and son Sinfj\xc3\xb6tli killed men wearing wolfskins; when they donned the skins themselves, they were cursed to become werewolves.\n\nThe dwarf Andvari is described as being able to magically turn into a pike. Alberich, his counterpart in Richard Wagner\'s Der Ring des Nibelungen, using the Tarnhelm, takes on many forms, including a giant serpent and a toad, in a failed attempt to impress or intimidate Loki and Odin/Wotan.\n\nFafnir was originally a dwarf, a giant or even a human, depending on the exact myth, but in all variants he transformed into a dragon\xe2\x80\x94a symbol of greed\xe2\x80\x94while guarding his ill-gotten hoard. His brother, \xc3\x93tr, enjoyed spending time as an otter, which led to his accidental slaying by Loki.\n\nIn Scandinavia, there existed, for example, the famous race of she-werewolves known with a name of Maras, women who took on the appearance of the night looking for huge half-human and half-wolf monsters. If a female at midnight stretches the membrane which envelopes the foal when it is brought forth, between four sticks and creeps through it, naked, she will bear children without pain; but all the boys will be shamans, and all the girls Maras.[citation needed]\n\nThe Nisse is sometimes said to be a shapeshifter. This trait also is attributed to Huldra.\n\nGunnhild, Mother of Kings (Gunnhild konungam\xc3\xb3\xc3\xb0ir) (c. 910 \xe2\x80\x93 c. 980), a quasi-historical figure who appears in the Icelandic Sagas, according to which she was the wife of Eric Bloodaxe, was credited with magic powers - including the power of shapeshifting and turning at will into a bird. She is the central character of the novel Mother of Kings by Poul Anderson,[9] which considerably elaborates on her shapeshifting abilities.\n\nOther lore [ edit ]\n\nArmenian [ edit ]\n\nIn Armenian mythology, shapeshifters include the Nhang, a serpentine river monster than can transform itself into a woman or seal, and will drown humans and then drink their blood; or the beneficial Shahapet, a guardian spirit that can appear either as a man or a snake.[10]\n\nIndian [ edit ]\n\nAncient Indian mythology tells of N\xc4\x81ga, snakes that can sometimes assume human form. Scriptures describe shapeshifting Rakshasa (demons) assuming animal forms to deceive humans. The Ramayana also includes the Vanara, a group of apelike humanoids who possessed supernatural powers and could change their shapes.[11][12]\n\nYoginis were associated with the power of shapeshifting into female animals.[14]\n\nIn the Indian fable The Dog Bride from Folklore of the Santal Parganas by Cecil Henry Bompas, a buffalo herder falls in love with a dog that has the power to turn into a woman when she bathes.\n\nPhilippines [ edit ]\n\nPhilippine mythology includes the Aswang, a vampiric monster capable of transforming into a bat, a large black dog, a black cat, a black boar or some other form in order to stalk humans at night. The folklore also mentions other beings such as the Kapre, the Tikbalang and the Engkanto, which change their appearances to woo beautiful maidens. Also, talismans (called ""anting-anting"" or ""birtud"" in the local dialect), can give their owners the ability to shapeshift. In one tale, Chonguita the Monkey Wife,[15] a woman is turned into a monkey, only becoming human again if she can marry a handsome man.\n\nTatar [ edit ]\n\nTatar folklore includes Yuxa, a hundred-year-old snake that can transform itself into a beautiful young woman, and seeks to marry men in order to have children.\n\n""Madame White Snake"" Picture on long veranda in the Summer Palace , Beijing, China\n\nChinese [ edit ]\n\nChinese mythology contains many tales of animal shapeshifters, capable of taking on human form. The most common such shapeshifter is the huli jing, a fox spirit which usually appears as a beautiful young woman; most are dangerous, but some feature as the heroines of love stories. Madame White Snake is one such legend; a snake falls in love with a man, and the story recounts the trials that she and her husband faced.\n\nJapanese [ edit ]\n\nKuzunoha the fox woman, casting a fox shadow\n\nIn Japanese folklore \xc5\x8dbake are a type of y\xc5\x8dkai with the ability to shapeshift. The fox, or kitsune is among the most commonly known, but other such creatures include the bakeneko, the mujina and the tanuki.\n\nKorean [ edit ]\n\nKorean mythology also contains a fox with the ability to shapeshift. Unlike its Chinese and Japanese counterparts, the kumiho is always malevolent. Usually its form is of a beautiful young woman; one tale recounts a man, a would-be seducer, revealed as a kumiho.[16] The kumiho has nine tails and as she desires to be a full human, she uses her beauty to seduce men and eat their hearts (or in some cases livers where the belief is that 100 livers would turn her into a real human).\n\nSomali [ edit ]\n\nIn Somali mythology Qori ismaris (""One who rubs himself with a stick"") was a man who could transform himself into a ""Hyena-man"" by rubbing himself with a magic stick at nightfall and by repeating this process could return to his human state before dawn.\n\nSouthern Africa [ edit ]\n\n\xc7\x80Kaggen is Mantis, a demi-urge and folk hero of the \xc7\x80Xam people of southern Africa.[17] He is a trickster god who can shape shift, usually taking the form of a praying mantis but also a bull eland, a louse, a snake, and a caterpillar.[18]\n\nTrinidad and Tobago [ edit ]\n\nThe Ligahoo or loup-garou is the shapeshifter of Trinidad and Tobago\'s folklore. This unique ability is believed to be handed down in some old creole families, and is usually associated with witch-doctors and practitioners of African magic.[19] [20]\n\nMapuche (Argentina and Chile) [ edit ]\n\nThe name of the Nahuel Huapi Lake in Argentina derives from the toponym of its major island in Mapudungun (Mapuche language): ""Island of the Jaguar (or Puma)"", from nahuel, ""puma (or jaguar)"", and huap\xc3\xad, ""island"". There is, however, more to the word ""Nahuel"" - it can also signify ""a man who by sorcery has been transformed into a puma"" (or jaguar).\n\nFolktales [ edit ]\n\nThemes [ edit ]\n\nShapeshifting may be used as a plot device, such as when Puss in Boots in the fairy tales tricks the ogre into becoming a mouse to be eaten. Shapeshifting may also include symbolic significance, like the Beast\'s transformation in Beauty and the Beast indicates Belle\'s ability to accept him despite his appearance.\n\nWhen a form is taken on involuntarily, the thematic effect can be one of confinement and restraint; the person is bound to the new form. In extreme cases, such as petrifaction, the character is entirely disabled. On the other hand, voluntary shapeshifting can be a means of escape and liberation. Even when the form is not undertaken to resemble a literal escape, the abilities specific to the form allow the character to act in a manner that was previously impossible.\n\nExamples of this are in fairy tales. A prince who is forced into a bear\'s shape (as in East of the Sun and West of the Moon) is a prisoner, but a princess who takes on a bear\'s shape voluntarily to flee a situation (as in The She-Bear) escapes with her new shape.[26] In the Earthsea books, Ursula K. Le Guin depicts an animal form as slowly transforming the wizard\'s mind, so that the dolphin, bear or other creature forgets it was human, making it impossible to change back. This makes an example for a voluntary shapeshifting becoming an imprisoning metamorphosis. Beyond this, the uses of shapeshifting, transformation, and metamorphosis in fiction are as protean as the forms the characters take on. Some are rare, such as Italo Calvino\'s ""The Canary Prince"" is a Rapunzel variant in which shapeshifting is used to gain access to the tower.\n\nPunitive changes [ edit ]\n\nIn many cases, imposed forms are punitive in nature. This may be a just punishment, the nature of the transformation matching the crime for which it occurs; in other cases, the form is unjustly imposed by an angry and powerful person. In fairy tales, such transformations are usually temporary, but they commonly appear as the resolution of myths (as in many of the Metamorphoses) or produce origin myths.\n\nTransformation chase [ edit ]\n\nIn many fairy tales and ballads, as in Child Ballad #44, The Twa Magicians or Farmer Weathersky, a magical chase occurs where the pursued endlessly takes on forms in an effort to shake off the pursuer, and the pursuer answers with shapeshifting, as, a dove is answered with a hawk, and a hare with a greyhound. The pursued may finally succeed in escape or the pursuer in capturing.\n\nThe Grimm Brothers fairy tale Foundling-Bird contains this as the bulk of the plot.[28] In the Italian Campania Fables collection of Pentamerone by Gianbattista Basile, tells of a Neapolitan princess who, to escape from her father who had imprisoned her, becomes a huge she-bear. The magic happens due to a potion given to her by an old witch. The girl, once gone, can regain her human aspect.\n\nIn other variants, the pursued may transform various objects into obstacles, as in the fairy tale ""The Master Maid"", where the Master Maid transforms a wooden comb into a forest, a lump of salt into a mountain, and a flask of water into a sea. In these tales, the pursued normally escapes after overcoming three obstacles.[29] This obstacle chase is literally found worldwide, in many variants in every region.[30]\n\nIn fairy tales of the Aarne\xe2\x80\x93Thompson type 313A, The Girl Helps the Hero Flee, such a chase is an integral part of the tale. It can be either a transformation chase (as in The Grateful Prince, King Kojata, Foundling-Bird, Jean, the Soldier, and Eulalie, the Devil\'s Daughter, or The Two Kings\' Children) or an obstacle chase (as in The Battle of the Birds, The White Dove, or The Master Maid).[31]\n\nIn a similar effect, a captive may shapeshift in order to break a hold on him. Proteus and Nereus\'s shapeshifting was to prevent heroes such as Menelaus and Heracles from forcing information from them. Tam Lin, once seized by Janet, was transformed by the faeries to keep Janet from taking him, but as he had advised her, she did not let go, and so freed him.[33] The motif of capturing a person by holding him through many transformations is found in folktales throughout Europe,[7] and Patricia A. McKillip references it in her Riddle-Master trilogy: a shapeshifting Earthmaster finally wins its freedom by startling the man holding it.\n\nPowers [ edit ]\n\nOne motif is a shape change in order to obtain abilities in the new form. Berserkers were held to change into wolves and bears in order to fight more effectively. In many cultures, evil magicians could transform into animal shapes and thus skulk about.\n\nIn many fairy tales, the hero\'s talking animal helper proves to be a shapeshifted human being, able to help him in its animal form. In one variation, featured in The Three Enchanted Princes and The Death of Koschei the Deathless, the hero\'s three sisters have been married to animals. These prove to be shapeshifted men, who aid their brother-in-law in a variant of tale types.[34]\n\nIn an early Mayan text, the Shapeshifter, or Mestaclocan, has the ability to change his appearance and to manipulate the minds of animals. In one tale, the Mestaclocan finds a dying eagle. Changing into the form of an eagle, he convinces the dying bird that it is, in fact, not dying. As the story goes they both soar into the heavens, and lived together for eternity.\n\nBildungsroman [ edit ]\n\nBeauty and the Beast has been interpreted as a young woman\'s coming-of-age, in which she changes from being repulsed by sexual activity and regarding a husband therefore bestial, to a mature woman who can marry.\n\nNeeded items [ edit ]\n\nValkyries as swan maidens, having shed their swan skins.\n\nSome shapeshifters are able to change form only if they have some item, usually an article of clothing. In Bisclavret by Marie de France, a werewolf cannot regain human form without his clothing, but in wolf form does no harm to anyone. The most common use of this motif, however, is in tales where a man steals the article and forces the shapeshifter, trapped in human form, to become his bride. This lasts until she discovers where he has hidden the article, and she can flee. Selkies feature in these tales. Others include swan maidens and the Japanese tennin.\n\nSwedish writer Selma Lagerl\xc3\xb6f, in The Wonderful Adventures of Nils, included a version of the story with the typical elements (fisherman sees mermaids dancing on an island and steals the sealskin of one of them, preventing her from becoming a seal again so that he could marry her) and linked it to the founding of the city of Stockholm [36]\n\nInner conflict [ edit ]\n\nThe power to externally transform can symbolize an internal savagery; a central theme in many strands of werewolf mythology, and the inversion of the ""liberation"" theme, as in Dr Jekyll\'s transformation into Mr. Hyde.\n\nUsurpation [ edit ]\n\nSister Alenushka Weeping about Brother Ivanushka by Brother and Sister: Alenushka laments her brother\'s transformation into a goat. by Viktor Vasnetsov , Russian variant of: Alenushka laments her brother\'s transformation into a goat.\n\nSome transformations are performed to remove the victim from his place, so that the transformer can usurp it. Bisclaveret\'s wife steals his clothing and traps him in wolf form because she has a lover. A witch, in The Wonderful Birch, changed a mother into a sheep to take her place, and had the mother slaughtered; when her stepdaughter married the king, the witch transformed her into a reindeer so as to put her daughter in the queen\'s place. In the Korean Transformation of the Kumiho, a kumiho, a fox with magical powers, transformed itself into an image of the bride, only being detected when her clothing is removed. In Brother and Sister, when two children flee from their cruel stepmother, she enchants the streams along the way to transform them. While the brother refrains from the first two, which threaten to turn them into tigers and wolves, he is too thirsty at the third, which turns him into a deer. The Six Swans are transformed into swans by their stepmother, as are the Children of Lir in Irish mythology.\n\nIll-advised wishes [ edit ]\n\nMany fairy-tale characters have expressed ill-advised wishes to have any child at all, even one that has another form, and had such children born to them.[39] At the end of the fairy tale, normally after marriage, such children metamorphose into human form. Hans My Hedgehog was born when his father wished for a child, even a hedgehog. Even stranger forms are possible: Giambattista Basile included in his Pentamerone the tale of a girl born as a sprig of myrtle, and Italo Calvino, in his Italian Folktales, a girl born as an apple.\n\nSometimes, the parent who wishes for a child is told how to gain one, but does not obey the directions perfectly, resulting in the transformed birth. In Prince Lindworm, the woman eats two onions, but does not peel one, resulting in her first child being a lindworm. In Tatterhood, a woman magically produces two flowers, but disobeys the directions to eat only the beautiful one, resulting her having a beautiful and sweet daughter, but only after a disgusting and hideous one.\n\nLess commonly, ill-advised wishes can transform a person after birth. The Seven Ravens are transformed when their father thinks his sons are playing instead of fetching water to christen their newborn and sickly sister, and curses them.[40] In Puddocky, when three princes start to quarrel over the beautiful heroine, a witch curses her because of the noise.\n\nMonstrous bride/bridegroom [ edit ]\n\nSuch wished-for children may become monstrous brides or bridegrooms. These tales have often been interpreted as symbolically representing arranged marriages; the bride\'s revulsion to marrying a stranger being symbolized by his bestial form.[41]\n\nThe heroine must fall in love with the transformed groom. The hero or heroine must marry, as promised, and the monstrous form is removed by the wedding. Sir Gawain thus transformed the Loathly lady; although he was told that this was half-way, she could at his choice be beautiful by day and hideous by night, or vice versa, he told her that he would choose what she preferred, which broke the spell entirely. In Tatterhood, Tatterhood is transformed by her asking her bridegroom why he didn\'t ask her why she rode a goat, why she carried a spoon, and why she was so ugly, and when he asked her, denying it and therefore transforming her goat into a horse, her spoon into a fan, and herself into a beauty. Puddocky is transformed when her prince, after she had helped him with two other tasks, tells him that his father has sent him for a bride. A similar effect is found in Child ballad 34, Kemp Owyne, where the hero can transform a dragon back into a maiden by kissing her three times.\n\nSometimes the bridegroom removes his animal skin for the wedding night, whereupon it can be burned. Hans My Hedgehog, The Donkey and The Pig King fall under this grouping. At an extreme, in Prince Lindworm, the bride who avoids being eaten by the lindworm bridegroom arrives at her wedding wearing every gown she owns, and she tells the bridegroom she will remove one of hers if he removes one of his; only when her last gown comes off has he removed his last skin, and become a white shape that she can form into a man.[1]\n\nIn some tales, the hero or heroine must obey a prohibition; the bride must spend a period of time not seeing the transformed groom in human shape (as in East of the Sun and West of the Moon), or the bridegroom must not burn the animals\' skins. In The Brown Bear of Norway, The Golden Crab, The Enchanted Snake and some variants of The Frog Princess, burning the skin is a catastrophe, putting the transformed bride or bridegroom in danger. In these tales, the prohibition is broken, invariably, resulting in a separation and a search by one spouse for the other.[1]\n\nDeath [ edit ]\n\nGhosts sometimes appear in animal form. In The Famous Flower of Serving-Men, the heroine\'s murdered husband appears to the king as a white dove, lamenting her fate over his own grave. In The White and the Black Bride and The Three Little Men in the Wood, the murdered \xe2\x80\x93 drowned \xe2\x80\x93 true bride reappears as a white duck. In The Rose Tree and The Juniper Tree, the murdered children become birds who avenge their own deaths. There are African folk tales of murder victims avenging themselves in the form of crocodiles that can shapeshift into human form.[44]\n\nIn some fairy tales, the character can reveal himself in every new form, and so a usurper repeatedly kills the victim in every new form, as in Beauty and Pock Face, A String of Pearls Twined with Golden Flowers, and The Boys with the Golden Stars. This eventually leads to a form in which the character (or characters) can reveal the truth to someone able to stop the villain.\n\nSimilarly, the transformation back may be acts that would be fatal. In The Wounded Lion, the prescription for turning the lion back into a prince was to kill him, chop him to pieces, burn the pieces, and throw the ash into water. Less drastic but no less apparently fatal, the fox in The Golden Bird, the foals in The Seven Foals, and the cats in Lord Peter and The White Cat tell the heroes of those stories to cut off their heads; this restores them to human shape.[45] In the Greek tale of Scylla, Scylla\'s father Nisus turns into an eagle after death and drowns her daughter for betraying her father.\n\nModern [ edit ]\n\nFiction [ edit ]\n\nPopular culture [ edit ]\n\nSee also [ edit ]\n\nNotes [ edit ]\n\nCitations [ edit ]\n\nBibliography [ edit ]\n\nFurther reading [ edit ]\n\nHall, Jamie (2003).

"b'Is Princess Eugenie ""frustrated"" that she\'s not ""getting the attention she deserves"" for her royal work? That\'s the latest claim coming from a website known for its fabricated stories, but Gossip Cop can set the record straight. We\'re told it\'s ""rubbish.""\n\nCan Nguyen/REX/Shutterstock\n\nAccording to Celeb Dirty Laundry, not a single person ""seems to be paying any attention to Eugenie"" and the ""hard work she\'s been putting in to help raise money for charities."" On the other hand, purports the outlet, ""Kate Middleton [and] Meghan Markle are making headlines for their pregnancy and royal wedding plans."" Without a single source to support its premise, the often discredited site goes on to assert that the 27-year-old daughter of Prince Andrew recently raised ""more than $600,000 for elephant and rhino charities,"" but the gala ""didn\'t make any headlines"" as the ""media is focusing more on Prince Harry and Markle\'s upcoming royal wedding"" and Middleton\'s third pregnancy.\n\nThe outlet, which is routinely caught telling tales about the royal family, further alleges that this is ""frustrating for someone like Eugenie"" who has been ""trying so hard to be noticed in recent weeks."" The bad blog concludes, ""For the first time in a long time, she\'s taking her royal duties and responsibilities very seriously."" But Gossip Cop investigated the seemingly made-up report, and a royal source tells us the story is ""rubbish.""\n\nUnlike CDL, Princess Eugenie understands that her cousins have a lot going on at the moment, particularly with engagements and pregnancies. Additionally, the princess has always lived relatively under-the-radar compared to Prince William and Prince Harry, and that isn\'t ""frustrating"" for her. The only remotely factual aspect of the entire story is that Princess Eugenie helped raise money for animal charities earlier this month, but she didn\'t take part in the gala just to receive media attention. It\'s all lies.\n\nIt should be noted, Gossip Cop previously corrected the untrustworthy website when it falsely alleged Princess Eugenie and Princess Beatrice were ""ignoring"" the announcement of Prince Harry and Markle\'s engagement. Much like that meritless and untrue claim, this latest one about Princess Eugenie feeling ""frustrated"" over a ""lack of attention"" in the media is equally phony.\n\nMore on Gossip Cop:\n\nKatie Holmes doesn\'t want to get work done to her face\n\nIs Ellen and Portia\'s wedding at a breaking point?\n\nWhat does Tom Cruise think about Suri wanting to go into show business?'"

"b""When members of the royal family tie the knot, there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot at stake\xe2\x80\x94including a whole lot of money. Which is why it might be surprising to some onlookers that, according to the Daily Mail, Prince Harry has declined to seek a prenuptial agreement before he marries Meghan Markle today in Windsor. But we spoke to two royal experts who said nobody should be shocked at this news. When it comes to the royals, prenups are simply not done.\n\nThis is not a celebrity marriage, it\xe2\x80\x99s a royal marriage.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think members of the royal family sign prenuptial agreements,\xe2\x80\x9d says Katie Nicholl, author of . \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s commonplace with celebrity marriage, but this is not a celebrity marriage, it\xe2\x80\x99s a royal marriage.\xe2\x80\x9d Nicholl says that Prince William and Kate Middleton also did not sign a prenuptial agreement, despite the very public divorce between William and Harry\xe2\x80\x99s parents, Prince Charles and Princess Diana. And even though three of the Queen\xe2\x80\x99s four children have divorced, none apparently had a prenuptial agreement.\n\nYes, there is a large sum of money in the balance for this marriage, but the true, staggering wealth belongs to the Queen, so it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be divided up if Meghan and Harry did end up divorcing. \xe2\x80\x9cYou wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t need a prenuptial agreement to stop Windsor Castle from being cut in half in the event they divorce, because it\xe2\x80\x99s not Harry\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x9d says Duncan Larcombe, author of .\n\nLarcombe notes that Harry does have substantial wealth on his own, thanks to his inheritance from Princess Diana, but the Queen holds the vast majority of the royal property and fortune. The Queen's net worth has been estimated at around $500 million, while Prince Harry's is estimated anywhere from $25 to $40 million. Meghan also has her own money as a successful actress on Suits, reportedly making around $50,000 per episode of the long-running series.\n\nIf Meghan and Harry do ever divorce, Larcombe adds, the vast majority of negotiations would happen outside of court. For example, Diana received a new title, a financial settlement, and was entitled to royal security protection, although she turned that down. Plus, the Daily Mail notes that even though prenups are taken into account in U.K. divorces, they\xe2\x80\x99re not legally enforceable.\n\nAnd though royal divorces may have had a violent start, thanks to Henry VIII\xe2\x80\x99s habit for decapitation, royal splits try to make as few waves as possible in modern times. \xe2\x80\x9cIn the modern history of the royal family, the divorce is described as amicable for PR reasons,\xe2\x80\x9d Larcombe says, \xe2\x80\x9cand the person who is departing the royal family, they\xe2\x80\x99re just looked after, and those arrangements are not done through court, they\xe2\x80\x99re done behind closed doors.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThis content is created and maintained by a third party, and imported onto this page to help users provide their email addresses.

"b'During the summer of 1995, John F.

Getty Images\n\nThankfully JFK Jr. agreed, and he and Terenzio figured out the best way to get into the Carlyle unnoticed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had remembered that the last time I had been to the Carlyle for an event, there had been no photographers at the front entrance,\xe2\x80\x9d Terenzio told People. \xe2\x80\x9cSo I told John, \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t go in the side entrance, because if anyone does leak it beforehand, people will expect you to go in the side. So walk in the front door.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTurns out Terenzio was right and the two celebrities walked straight into the hotel while the photographers were camped out at the side door.\n\nEven though JFK Jr. had a \xe2\x80\x9crespectful piece\xe2\x80\x9d in mind, according to Terenzio, the story never ended up happening.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe wrote John a note that said, \xe2\x80\x98Thank you so much, but not right now,\'\xe2\x80\x9d Terenzio recalls.\n\nAfter the meeting, JFK Jr. ""was very careful what he said,"" George magazine creative director Matt Berman told People. \xe2\x80\x9cThe one funny thing he said was, \xe2\x80\x98She\xe2\x80\x99s got a great pair of legs.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWhile he might not have mentioned that to his assistant, \xe2\x80\x9cI do remember him saying, \xe2\x80\x98She\xe2\x80\x99s really tall!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Terenzio says. \xe2\x80\x9cHe also said she was very shy.

Here\xe2\x80\x99s what he thinks \xe2\x80\xa6\n\nTom Hiddleston, 36, was shocked to learn that Taylor Swift, 27, dropped some bars about their relationship on her new album, \xe2\x80\x9cReputation\xe2\x80\x9c. But, come on, Tom; anyone\xe2\x80\x99s fair game in Tay land. The singer referenced her ex on two tracks \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cI Did Something Bad\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cGetaway Car\xe2\x80\x9d. And, since the pair didn\xe2\x80\x99t split on bad terms [or so we thought], he was under the impression that he would\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten a get out of fail free card when it was time for Tay to pen a new album.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTom was not expecting to be a part of Taylor\xe2\x80\x99s album,\xe2\x80\x9d a source close to the actor tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. \xe2\x80\x9cHe thought they were on good terms,\xe2\x80\x9d our insider says, adding, \xe2\x80\x9cAfter their break-up, he was always asked if he was worried she was going to write about him, and he always said no.

The first verse is a nod to Kanye West, 40, where she sings about a \xe2\x80\x9cnarcissist\xe2\x80\x9d who \xe2\x80\x9ctalks sh-t.\xe2\x80\x9d Then, Tom came in. In the second verse, Tay sings about a \xe2\x80\x9cplayboy\xe2\x80\x9d who she flew \xe2\x80\x9caround the world\xe2\x80\x9d with before she broke up with him. Well, she and Tom flew to Italy in the beginning stages of their relationship. Then, the song references to this man spending all of her money. And, when Tay and Tom were together, it was speculated that he was with her for her fame. So, you can decide.\n\nThe second Tom reference on \xe2\x80\x9cReputation\xe2\x80\x9d came on the track, \xe2\x80\x9cGetaway Car\xe2\x80\x9d, which happens to be the only breakup song on the album. This track references both Tom and Calvin Harris, 33. In the beginning of the song, Taylor sings about wanting to get out of one relationship, but she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have a \xe2\x80\x9creason.\xe2\x80\x9d Then, when she goes to an event where \xe2\x80\x9cthe ties were black and the lights were white,\xe2\x80\x9d she found her reason \xe2\x80\x94 a new man, aka, Tom. In case you forgot, Taylor and Tom were first linked when they were seen together at the Met Gala\xe2\x80\xa6 the home of black ties. Not long after the Met, she split with Calvin and ended up dating Tom. Coincidence? Nah. THEN, when the chorus comes around, Tay points out that the new relationship didn\xe2\x80\x99t work out, and that the person [Tom] should\xe2\x80\x99ve known how things would end, because of how they got together in the first place.

Simpson was guilty of the murder of his wife Nicole Brown and her friend Ron Goldman.\n\nKardashian, the father of Kourtney, Khloe, Kim and their brother Rob, was part of Simpson\xe2\x80\x99s defense team during his 1995 trial.\n\nThe disgraced football star was acquitted of the charges but, in 1998, was found \xe2\x80\x98responsible\xe2\x80\x99 for the deaths in a subsequent civil trial.\n\nWriting in her memoir, Jenner says she was in a car with Kardashian a few years after the murders when he said: 'I would\xe2\x80\x99ve been okay with it if they had gotten him [Simpson] in the first trial.'\n\nAn insider tells DailyMail.com that the Kardashians learned of the 67-year-old\xe2\x80\x99s plan from her model son Brody\n\nShe added: 'The implication was obvious that he believed O.J. was guilty.\xe2\x80\x99\n\nAccording to a family insider, Kris and the four Kardashians now rarely speak to Jenner.\n\nThe insider said: \xe2\x80\x98Kylie and do [talk to Jenner]. They do keep in communication and they\xe2\x80\x99re fully supportive [of her transition].\n\n\xe2\x80\x98But when Kylie and Kendall do speak with her, it\xe2\x80\x99s always secret \xe2\x80\x93 they don\xe2\x80\x99t want to bring it up to their mom or sisters because it causes a lot of drama, so they keep it secret and between them.\xe2\x80\x99\n\nThe source added: \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s just the Kardashian part of the family that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been talking to her. They feel like she had been riding on their coattails long enough for the fame and that she is really milking it for all its worth.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98They feel if she wants to do things her way, she should be on her own - a lot of these things that she\xe2\x80\x99s doing are trying to one-up them and trying to gain the spotlight back.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98While [the operation] was inevitable, they think her plan to do the nude spread is over the top. That\xe2\x80\x99s something that is really annoying to them.\xe2\x80\x99"""

"b""UPDATE, WRITETHRU with more detail: Shortly before he was due to appear on ITV\xe2\x80\x99s Good Morning Britain today, Ewan McGregor pulled out of the interview, citing comments made about this weekend\xe2\x80\x99s Women\xe2\x80\x99s March by host Piers Morgan. A supporter of President Donald Trump, Morgan yesterday on the program described some of the women who marched as \xe2\x80\x9crabid feminists\xe2\x80\x9d and said he didn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x9csee the point of the march(es)\xe2\x80\x9d which he called \xe2\x80\x9cgeneric\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cvacuous.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nOn Twitter this morning, McGregor, who is out promoting Trainspotting sequel T2: Trainspotting, wrote, \xe2\x80\x9cWas going on Good Morning Britain, didn\xe2\x80\x99t realise Piers Morgan was host.

You\xe2\x80\x99re just an actor after all. \xe2\x80\x94 Piers Morgan (@piersmorgan) January 24, 2017\n\nMorgan also tweeted he expected McGregor was reacting to his Monday column in the Daily Mail in which he called himself \xe2\x80\x9ca feminist,\xe2\x80\x9d but decried comments made by Madonna on Saturday saying, \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t abide the feminazis, the radical, extreme feminists like Madonna.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nOn Tuesday, Morgan took to the middle-market UK tabloid to launch a vicious attack on McGregor where he referred to the actor as \xe2\x80\x9cunprofessional\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cdisingenuous.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn actor who had contractually agreed to appear on a TV show to promote his new film pulls out at the last minute because he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like the political opinion of one of the presenters,\xe2\x80\x9d said Morgan.\n\nMorgan said that after scrolling through McGregor\xe2\x80\x99s Twitter feed, it \xe2\x80\x9crevealed a man absolutely enraged by both Donald Trump\xe2\x80\x99s ascent to the presidency, and by Britain\xe2\x80\x99s decision to leave the European Union.\xe2\x80\x9d He added: \xe2\x80\x9cHis fury at the latter may strike some as slightly disingenuous given that McGregor himself quit the EU years ago to go and live the life of a pampered millionaire movie star in Hollywood. But I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave others to decide whether that is hypocritical or not.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe presenter continued his tirade by taking a swipe at celebrities who take the podium to make \xe2\x80\x9cpolitical statements that remain unchallenged,\xe2\x80\x9d which he says was \xe2\x80\x9ctypified by Meryl Streep\xe2\x80\x99s extraordinarily pompous and elitist anti-Trump speech at the recent Golden Globes.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMorgan even suggested that those who voted for Trump or for Brexit to \xe2\x80\x9cnow boycott his movies\xe2\x80\x9d before criticizing McGregor for being \xe2\x80\x9cpaedophile-loving\xe2\x80\x9d due to the fact he worked on Roman Polanski\xe2\x80\x99s film The Ghostwriter.\n\nA spokesperson for Good Morning Britain told the BBC today that McGregor \xe2\x80\x9ccame into GMB this morning to be interviewed about his new film but decided not to go ahead with it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPer the Guardian, Morgan said on the telecast this morning, \xe2\x80\x9cSorry that Ewan McGregor\xe2\x80\x99s not here.

Hasselhoff, 63, who filed court documents last month to cut off the payments, has shelled out $2.3 million to his former spouse since their divorce in 2006.\n\nBach, 52, receives $252,000 per year from Hasselhoff, but the singer/actor only grosses $112,000 a month. Though Hasselhoff spends $66,000 of it, with living expenses, taxes and Bach\xe2\x80\x99s payments, he has minimal funds to save. And while a court hearing has been set for the end of May, Hasselhoff isn\xe2\x80\x99t sure if his current endeavors will be enough to salvage the payments.\n\nHasselhoff\xe2\x80\x99s European tour was cut short due to poor ticket sales, and he\xe2\x80\x99s reportedly unsure if his new reality show, \xe2\x80\x9cHoff the Record,\xe2\x80\x9d will find the same success as his previous small-screen endeavors.\n\nWhile the documents obtained by the website noted that Hasselhoff\xe2\x80\x99s assets, including real estate, cars, jewelry and retirement savings, among others, total $1.79 million, the cash flow is drying up.\n\nThough Bach\xe2\x80\x99s team alleges that Hasselhoff\xe2\x80\x99s net worth is more than $120 million, the newly engaged star has already nixed retirement plans to stay afloat.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am 63 years of age, and am at an age when I should be preparing for retirement and not having to continue working in order to pay [Bach\xe2\x80\x99s] support,\xe2\x80\x9d Hasselhoff said in papers filed in April.\n\nThough he is set to make an appearance in next year\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cBaywatch\xe2\x80\x9d reboot, it\xe2\x80\x99s unclear if that paycheck will ease his stress.

Normal stuff,\xe2\x80\x9d before explaining that Satan\xe2\x80\x99s guidance is \xe2\x80\x9cbetter than Jesus\xe2\x80\x99 guidance.\xe2\x80\x9c\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been there, done that. Jesus is ok. He\xe2\x80\x99s boring, you know? He gave Satan a bad rap. Jesus is the goody two shoes with no life. I prayed to Satan last Friday. I was in a foreign city, I barely knew anyone. He spoke to me quietly, prompting me to dress like a boy.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI went out into the street dressed like a boy and I just walked and walked, following his whispers. I found myself in a dark alley by some kind of industrial area. Two big guys, rough guys you know, they suddenly appeared and I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, I guess you\xe2\x80\x99d call it rape. They took me forcefully. Yeah, it was painful. But to be totally honest, the whole experience was transcendental.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was one of the most amazing experiences of my life. When they were both finished, I started straight into their eyes and said \xe2\x80\x9cHail Satan\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not sure they understood but they appeared calmed by my words.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMiley Cyrus\xe2\x80\x99s Satanic confession is merely the latest in a long line of public dalliances the singer has shared with the devil. After starting her career with Disney, the pop star reinvented her image as a raunchy pop star, flashing Satanic hand gestures and promoting Illuminati symbolism as she rode to the top of the charts.\n\nSince establishing herself in the global consciousness as a Devil-worshipping entertainer, the singer has attempted to tame her dark image, however the disturbing conversation she held with the Swedish radio hosts suggests she is far from a reformed character, and she has openly sold her soul to Satan.\n\nThe incident has also sparked fears around the world that the Illuminati have moved onto the next phase of the masterplan, and have begun openly promoting Satanism as a viable religious choice for those seeking spiritual guidance.'"

"b'Taylor Swift is embracing her old favorite hobby this week: modeling great outfits for New York paparazzi while leaving her Tribeca apartment. Her first solo walk was Sunday, and today, she was snapped leaving her place in a very floral print romper and Kate Spade snakeskin backpack. And after breakup rumors started spreading among fans, Swift also took the opportunity to make a statement about the status of her and Joe Alwyn\'s relationship through her necklace choice:\n\nSplash News\n\nGetty Images\n\nFans were worried that Alwyn and Swift had hit a rough patch when photos of her Sunday look\xe2\x80\x94a Faith Connexion dress, Elie Saab sunglasses, a Stella McCartney bag, and Jimmy Choo knee-high boots (below)\xe2\x80\x94very visibly didn\'t include Swift wearing her silver ""J"" pendant necklace, the one she appears to be wearing again today (above).\n\nSplash News\n\nSwift always wears the necklace as a tribute to her boyfriend and their so-happily-private romance. She explained everything about the necklace in her song, ""Call It What You Want"" with the lyrics, """"I want to wear his initial on a chain round my neck/Chain round my neck/Not because he owns me/But \'cause he really knows me."" Swift told some fans that all of Reputation\'s love songs were about Alwyn.\n\nLaineyGossip pointed out that Sunday was just the second time Swift had been seen without her necklace; she also didn\'t wear it while performing last Tuesday in Maryland either. Maybe that meant something since Swift thinks about the details with her image; maybe it doesn\'t because it\'s just a necklace.\n\nSwift performs in Maryland last week, sans necklace. Getty Images\n\nBuzzfeed, meanwhile, noted that Swift didn\'t wear the pendant to the Billboard Music Awards in May, so it\'s not like this week was the first time in history she\'s ever publicly left the pendant at home. Also: She posted an Instagram (below) wearing it just four days ago. All in all, an abundance of evidence that the necklace is not any official sartorial indicator of her relationship health. It\'s not an engagement ring, and even those can come on and off without people breaking up.\n\nThis content is imported from Instagram. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.\n\nUp until the ultimately non-dramatic necklace saga, Alwyn and Swift\'s romance only made headlines for how happy, private, and well it\'s been going. Last week, photos came out of Swift and Alwyn holding hands on vacation in Turks and Caicos. Us Weekly ran a report seven days ago on how Swift was happier than ever with Alwyn, keeping things secretish.

"b'Beyonc\xc3\xa9 Knowles is a multi-platinum, Grammy Award-winning recording artist who\'s acclaimed for her thrilling vocals, videos and live shows.\n\nWho Is Beyonc\xc3\xa9 Knowles? Beyonc\xc3\xa9 Knowles first captured the public\'s eye as lead vocalist of the R&B group Destiny\'s Child. She later established a solo career with her debut album Dangerously in Love, becoming one of music\'s top-selling artists with sold-out tours and a slew of awards. Knowles has also starred in several films, including Dream Girls. She married hip-hop recording artist Jay-Z in 2008 and the couple has three children.\n\nEarly Life\n\nSinger and actress Beyonc\xc3\xa9 Giselle Knowles was born on September 4, 1981, in Houston, Texas. She started singing at an early age, competing in local talent shows and winning many of these events by impressing audiences with her singing and dancing abilities.\n\nDestiny\'s Child\n\nTeaming up with her cousin Kelly Rowland and two classmates, Knowles formed an all-female singing group. Her father, Matthew Knowles, served as the band\'s manager. The group went through some name and line-up changes before landing a record deal in 1997 with Columbia Records. Destiny\'s Child soon became one of the most popular R&B acts, with the release of their first, self-titled album. Gaining momentum, the group scored its first No. 1 single on the pop charts with ""Bills, Bills, Bills,"" off their second album. The recording also featured another smash hit, ""Say My Name.""\n\nWhile enjoying her group\'s success, Knowles began exploring other projects. She made her acting debut in 2001 with a starring role in Carmen: A Hip Hopera. She then co-starred with Mike Myers in the Austin Powers spy parody Goldmember the following year.\n\nKelly Rowland, Beyonc\xc3\xa9 Knowles and Michelle Williams performing at Super Bowl XLVII. Photo: TIMOTHY A. CLARY/AFP/Getty Images\n\nSolo Career\n\nOn the musical front, Knowles took center stage as a solo artist, releasing her first album, Dangerously in Love, in 2003. The recording became a huge success for her both commercially and critically. It sold millions of copies and won five Grammy Awards. On the album, Knowles worked with a number of different artists, including Missy Elliott, Sean Paul and Jay-Z. She was rumored to be dating Jay-Z around this time, but the couple did not publicly acknowledge their relationship.\n\nDestiny\'s Child released their last studio album, Destiny Fulfilled, in 2004, and officially broke up the following year.\n\nOn her own, Knowles continued to enjoy great success. Her second studio album, 2006\'s B\'Day featured such hits as ""Irreplaceable"" and ""Deja Vu."" On the big screen, she starred opposite Jennifer Hudson, Jaime Foxx and Eddie Murphy in Dreamgirls. The film was adapted from the hit Broadway musical of the same name.\n\nMarriage to Jay-Z\n\nIn 2008, Knowles married rapper and music mogul Jay-Z in a small, private ceremony in New York City. Among the guests sighted at the wedding were Knowles\' mother, Tina Knowles; father, Matthew; sister, Solange; Destiny\'s Child members Rowland and Michelle Williams; and friend Gwyneth Paltrow.\n\nThe newlywed continued to work as hard as ever, promoting her latest effort, I am... Sasha Fierce (2008). Knowles scored two big hits off the album \xe2\x80\x94 ""Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)"" and ""If I Were a Boy."" She also returned to the big screen that year, starring as R&B legend Etta James in Cadillac Records. The following January, Knowles sang James\' trademark song, ""At Last,"" for President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama at his inaugural ball.\n\nIn addition to acting and performing, Knowles ran a clothing line called House of Dereon with her mother. She also launched her own fragrance, Heat, in 2010. Throughout her career, Knowles has served as a spokesperson and model for several other brands, including L\'Oreal and Tommy Hilfiger.\n\nKnowles found herself under fire after performing a private concert for Libyan leader Muammar al-Qaddafi on New Year\'s Eve in 2010. She later donated her fee from the event to help victims of the Haitian earthquake. According to some reports, Knowles said that her father had been responsible for arranging the Libyan concert. She decided to drop her father as her manager in March 2011. Later that year, Knowles reached the top of the album charts with her latest solo release, 4.\n\nIn January 2013, Knowles generated some negative headlines for her performance at President Obama\'s second inauguration in Washington, D.C. She was criticized for reportedly pre-recording a version of ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" and lip-syncing to her own track during the outdoor ceremony. Despite wide media coverage, in the days following the incident, Knowles did not publicly address the controversy.\n\nNot long after, prior to her appearance at Super Bowl XLVII, Knowles performed the song live at a press conference. She explained to reporters that she had used a ""backing track"" at the inauguration, adding that she would ""absolutely be singing live"" at the NFL\'s biggest event of the year, according to The Huffington Post.\n\nIndeed, Knowles more than redeemed herself in the public eye at the Super Bowl on February 3, 2013. During the event\'s halftime show, she took the stage and wowed the crowd, joined by her former Destiny\'s Child bandmates Rowland and Williams for parts of her performance. Knowles also announced that her next major tour would start in the spring of 2013.\n\nBeyonc\xc3\xa9 Knowles and Jay-Z 2017 Grammy Awards Photo: Lester Cohen/Getty Images for NARAS\n\nAwards, Accolades and Surprise Album\n\nAt the 2010 Grammy Awards, Knowles walked away with six honors \xe2\x80\x94 the most wins in a single night by a female artist.

In 2011, she made the Forbes Top 10 list of entertainment\'s highest-earning women. By 2013, Knowles had won 16 Grammys.\n\nKnowles broke records once again on December 13, 2013, with her fifth studio album, self-titled Knowles. The album surprised fans and critics alike, as no promotion for the album had been announced prior to its release. The record, which Knowles called a ""visual album,"" was released exclusively on iTunes, with physical discs available for purchase after December 18. The record-breaking album sold more than 800,000 copies throughout the weekend it was released alone.\n\nThe collection \xe2\x80\x94 which was the fastest-selling album ever distributed by iTunes\xe2\x80\x94also marked Knowles\' fifth studio album to debut at No. 1, making her the first woman to reach No. 1 on the Billboard 200 with her first five albums. She released the Platinum Edition of the album in 2014, and the following year won three additional Grammys, including a Best R&B Performance award for ""Drunk in Love.""\n\nSecond Super Bowl and \'Lemonade\'\n\nIn February 2016, Knowles returned to the Super Bowl stage, once again earning raves for her performance. This time around she appeared with Bruno Mars and Chris Martin of the band Coldplay, highlighting her new single ""Formation"" and subsequently announcing a world tour. The tune, its video and accompanying halftime show also garnered a wave of attention for politicized lyrics and imagery touching on everything from Black power to Hurricane Katrina.\n\nJust two months later, the hour-long Knowles conceptual film, Lemonade, which presented tracks from the album of the same name released immediately afterward. The cable special showcased the singer reeling from the romantic and sexual betrayal of her partner while acknowledging the strength found in communities of African American women. Tennis star Serena Williams and young actress Quvenzhan\xc3\xa9 Wallis also made appearances in the New Orleans-based project, which was helmed by a variety of directors and featured poetry from Warsan Shire.\n\nLemonade the album was only initially available via Tidal, the online streaming service backed by Knowles\' spouse, Jay-Z, and then eventually became available on iTunes and Amazon with its accompanying film. Musical contributors to the project, which quickly garnered acclaim, included Jack White, The Weeknd, James Blake and Kendrick Lamar. Lemonade debuted at No. 1, making Beyonc\xc3\xa9 the only artist in history to have all of her first six studio albums reach the top of Billboard\'s album charts.\n\nIn February 2017, a pregnant Knowles delivered a surprise performance at the Grammys, singing songs from Lemonade amid a swirling spectacle of lights, holograms and backup dancers. Although she lost the coveted Album of the Year Grammy to Adele, she did take home two awards, for Best Urban Contemporary Album and Best Music Video.\n\nSolange and Beyonc\xc3\xa9 Knowles Photo: Josh Brasted/Getty Images\n\nCoachella, OTR II and \'Everything Is Love\'\n\nIn March 2018, reports surfaced that Knowles was working on new music and preparing to hit the road with Jay-Z. Following a false alarm in which a tour announcement appeared and quickly disappeared from her Facebook page, the power couple officially announced that their On the Run II (or OTR II) Tour would kick off in Cardiff, Wales, on June 6.\n\nOne year after she canceled a planned appearance at Coachella because of her pregnancy, Knowles took the stage for an eagerly anticipated performance at the April 2018 music festival. The first Black woman to headline the event, Knowles wowed attendees and critics alike with her top-shelf singing and choreography, delivering favorites like ""Crazy In Love"" and a rendition of the civil rights anthem ""Lift Every Voice and Sing."" She was also joined during the two-hour set by hubby Jay-Z, sister Solange and her old Destiny\'s Child cohorts, Rowland and Williams.\n\nIn June, Knowles and Jay-Z embarked on the European leg of their 48-date tour. While they lived up to expectations with their theatrics and swagger, the couple also surprised fans with the release of their joint album, Everything Is Love, following a London show on June 16. Initially available for streaming only on the Jay-Z owned Tidal, the nine-track album was accompanied by a video for the track ""Apes**t,"" which featured the couple and their dancers gallivanting around some of the world\'s most famous artworks at the Louvre in Paris.\n\n\'Homecoming,\' \'The Lion King\' and \'Black is King\'\n\nOn April 17, 2019, Knowles released a documentary about her Coachella performance, Homecoming, and a surprise companion album which included 40 live tracks.\n\nJuly brought the premiere of The Lion King, which featured Knowles as Nala, the childhood friend turned love interest of the titular character, played by Donald Glover. The singer also curated and produced a companion album for the production, titled The Lion King: The Gift, and released the single ""Spirit"" around the time of the film\'s release.\n\nIn April 2020, Knowles surfaced on a remix of rapper Megan Thee Stallion\'s ""Savage,"" with proceeds going to coronavirus relief efforts in their shared hometown of Houston.\n\nIn July 2020, Knowles directed, wrote and executive produced the visual album Black is King, which ""reimagines the lessons of The Lion King for today\'s young king and queens in search of their own crowns.""\n\nChildren\n\nFollowing years of pregnancy rumors, Knowles and Jay-Z went public with the news of their impending new arrival in 2011, the mom-to-be showing off her growing baby bump at the MTV Video Music Awards that August.\n\nKnowles and Jay-Z welcomed a baby daughter, Blue Ivy Carter, on January 7, 2012. The couple spared no expense to maintain their privacy during this special time, renting out a floor of New York\'s Lenox Hill Hospital.\n\nIn February 2017, Knowles announced on Instagram that she and Jay-Z were expecting twins. Later, the iconic shot was revealed to be the year\'s most-liked Instagram post, with 11.1 million fans offering their approval.\n\nThey welcomed twins, a boy and a girl, in June 2017. Although the couple didn\'t immediately confirm the twins\' birth or their names, People magazine reported that they had filed trademark documents at the United States Patent and Trademark Office for the names Sir and Rumi. In the early morning hours of July 14, Knowles made it official, posting a photo in which she\'s holding her one-month-old twins.'"
"b'Jennifer Garner was becoming increasingly worried about Ben Affleck before taking him to rehab for the third time, a source tells ET.\n\nGarner drove her estranged husband to rehab last week and was photographed arriving at Affleck\'s house looking visibly upset outside of his Pacific Palisades, California, home.

Jennifer Aniston, 49 reportedly \xe2\x80\x9cextended an invitation\xe2\x80\x9d to sit down with Angelina Jolie, 42, over dinner, sources tell In Touch magazine. \xe2\x80\x9cJen thought it was finally time to resolve the past,\xe2\x80\x9d an insider said, adding that since her marriage with Justin Theroux, 46, is over, Jen \xe2\x80\x9cwants a fresh start on all fronts.\xe2\x80\x9d However, Angelina supposedly turned the invite down! When Jen asked why Angie refused to meet her, the Girl, Interrupted star said \xe2\x80\x9cshe didn\xe2\x80\x99t owe her an apology,\xe2\x80\x9d per the source. \xe2\x80\x9cThe whole idea to get together for dinner turned into a disaster.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSo, why did Angie go all Maleficent on Jen\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to squash their beef? Well, Jen and Brad Pitt, 52, have reportedly rekindled their friendship following her spit from Justin. The two supposedly have these late night meetings, all set up by Brad\xe2\x80\x99s bud George Clooney, 56, and it\xe2\x80\x99s like old times again. Jen has reportedly found \xe2\x80\x9cclosure\xe2\x80\x9d with Brad over leaving her for Angie in 2004, and an insider says, \xe2\x80\x9cthere may even be a future for the two of them.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe idea of Angie\xe2\x80\x99s ex chilling with his other ex doesn\xe2\x80\x99t sit well with her. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s gotten back to her that Brad and Jen are in each other\xe2\x80\x99s lives again.

That was back in 2006, and it seems that fans will have to wait a little bit longer before these two patch things up.\n\nIn the meantime, Jennifer may not linger too much on Angie\xe2\x80\x99s alleged snub. She\xe2\x80\x99s ready to move on past her split with Justin and into the next stage in her life. This, as it turns out, includes giving dating a whirl, and she\xe2\x80\x99s looking for a younger man to put some excitement back into her life. Jen\xe2\x80\x99s all about having fun \xe2\x80\x9cwithout falling in love,\xe2\x80\x9d a source close to Jennifer EXCLUSIVELY told HollywoodLife.com.

"b'Cheerio! Photo: Emily Sundberg\n\nRoyal Inquiries is your comprehensive guide to everything you ever wanted to know about life under the crown.\n\nAs a world-famous royal expert \xe2\x80\x94 who happens to be the exact same height as Queen Elizabeth, not to brag \xe2\x80\x94 I\xe2\x80\x99m aware that all British royals absolutely love two things: (1) fancy hats, and (2) social media.\n\nEven though Meghan Markle had to cleanse her personal social-media accounts \xe2\x80\x94 and delete her lifestyle blog \xe2\x80\x94 before her upcoming May 19 wedding to Prince Harry, it\xe2\x80\x99s known that many royals have social-media presences. Some accounts are public; others are super secretive, but by god, they exist.\n\nSo, which royals have secret accounts? Why, I\xe2\x80\x99m so glad you asked! Here, let\xe2\x80\x99s go through the list of my favorite British royal adults and I\xe2\x80\x99ll break it all down for you.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II. Photo: Stuart C. Wilson/Getty Images\n\nRoyal: Queen Elizabeth II\n\nPublic social-media account?: Yes, @RoyalFamily\n\nSecret social-media account?: Yes!!!!!! Reportedly\n\nWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the deal?: Queen Elizabeth, my sister in height, apparently has a super-secret Facebook account, can you believe it? According to the British tabloids, the queen has a personal iPad and laptop, loves to text, and even has a clandestine Facebook.\n\nKate Middleton. Photo: Chris Jackson/Getty Images\n\nRoyal: Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge (Kate Middleton)\n\nPublic social-media account?: Yes, @KensingtonRoyal\n\nSecret social-media account?: Supposedly\n\nWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the deal: Kate reportedly has an account on the British website, Mumsnet. She\xe2\x80\x99s been on the mommy forum swapping parenting tips ever since the birth of her second child, Charlotte. That counts as social media, right?\n\nPrince William. Photo: WPA Pool/Getty Images\n\nRoyal: Prince William\n\nPublic social-media account?: Yes, @KensingtonRoyal\n\nSecret social-media account?: No\n\nWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the deal?: Other than his occasional tendency to dance like a dad at a club, Prince William seems like a pretty boring guy. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen any evidence of him having a secret social-media account, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t really suspect he has one. In 2007 there was a fake Prince William Facebook account that everyone freaked out over, however.\n\nPrince Harry. Photo: Chris Jackson/Getty Images\n\nRoyal: Prince Harry\n\nPublic social-media account?: Yes, @KensingtonRoyal\n\nSecret social-media account?: You better believe it!!!\n\nWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the deal?: Prince Harry may seem mature now, but let\xe2\x80\x99s not forget that he was very recently a wild child who wore inappropriate costumes, had far too much fun in Vegas, and loved social media. In fact, after the pictures of his Vegas misadventures emerged, Prince Harry was reportedly forced to shut down his beloved Facebook account \xe2\x80\xa6 in which he used the name \xe2\x80\xa6 wait for it \xe2\x80\xa6. are you ready? \xe2\x80\xa6 Spike Wells. !!!! Prince Harry/Spike reportedly had that Facebook account for four years. While he was courting Meghan, who was still on social media at that time, the prince reportedly had a secret Instagram account (that he used to follow her, close friends, and charities). It\xe2\x80\x99s unclear whether Prince Harry still has that account, but if Meghan had to get rid of hers, I should hope he\xe2\x80\x99d have been polite and done the same.\n\nMeghan Markle. Photo: WPA Pool/Getty Images\n\nRoyal: Meghan Markle\n\nPublic social-media account?: None at the moment, but I assume she will also be joining @KensingtonRoyal\n\nSecret social-media account?: No\n\nWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the deal?: There\xe2\x80\x99s no proof Meghan has a private Instagram or Twitter account, but don\xe2\x80\x99t you get the feeling she does? I mean, she was so into Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook for so long, had her lifestyle website the Tig, and she reportedly had an anonymous and very honest blog about being a working actress. BuzzFeed even recently uncovered a (now-deleted) Instagram pic she posted of someone who was potentially Prince Harry back in October 2016 (in which he was wearing a Golden Girls sweatshirt and his face was partially obscured!). So, this woman clearly loves social media. I figure she must have some accounts now, or at the very least is just lurking around on her phone.\n\nPrincess Beatrice. Photo: WPA Pool/Getty Images\n\nRoyal: Princess Beatrice\n\nPublic social-media account?: Yes, @yorkiebea\n\nSecret social-media account?: Instagram, baby!\n\nWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the deal?: According to Guest of a Guest, Princess Beatrice likely has a secret Instagram account. In February, the royal attended a party for David Geffen, of all people. There, Vanity Fair\xe2\x80\x99s Derek Blasberg, friend of all celebrities, tagged her in a pic on Instagram. The account he tagged is private, but I assume it\xe2\x80\x99s actually hers, especially because Prince Harry\xe2\x80\x99s ex-girlfriend Chelsy Davy (who has a public Instagram account) follows it. Princess Beatrice does have a public Twitter, though.\n\nPrincess Eugenie. Photo: Chris Jackson/Getty Images\n\nRoyal: Princess Eugenie\n\nPublic social-media account?: Yes, @PrincessEugenie\n\nSecret social-media account?: She doesn\xe2\x80\x99t need one!\n\nWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the deal?: Princess Eugenie is the only royal who officially has her own public Instagram account. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that nice? She posts cute pictures of herself and her sister Princess Beatrice when they were young, and some sweet current photos that include her mother Sarah Ferguson. She also posted an outtake from the official photoshoot in which she announced her engagement to her longtime boyfriend Jack Brooksbank. Can I get a #followback, Eugenie?\n\nSo there you have it for secret social accounts: Queen, yes; Kate, kind of; Will, ehhhh no; Harry, YESSS!; Meghan, probably?; Beatrice, yes; and Eugenie, she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t even need one! If you\xe2\x80\x99re wondering why I didn\xe2\x80\x99t include Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles on this list, it\xe2\x80\x99s because I haven\xe2\x80\x99t forgiven them for their affair and the pain they caused Princess Diana, sorry.'"

"b'Jason Momoa debuted as Aquaman in the DC Extended Universe in last fall\'s Justice League, with the character getting his own film this December. The new issue of Entertainment Weekly offers our first look at Nicole Kidman\'s character in the film, Queen Atlanna, alongside Momoa and Amber Heard as Mera. Check out the cover below.\n\n(Photo: Entertainment Weekly)\n\nAtlanna debuted in 1959\'s Adventure Comics #260, which focused on the early years of Arthur Curry. The comic depicted Atlanna getting washed ashore by a hurricane, ultimately falling in love with lighthouse keeper Tom Curry, resulting in Arthur\'s birth.\n\nIt\'s unclear exactly how closely to her comics origins the film will stick, though Kidman has professed her enthusiasm over the experience.\n\n""I got to be [like] a mermaid!"" Kidman revealed to The Hollywood Reporter last year. ""I got to be a queen, I got to wear a crown...I have a particular way of looking.""\n\nThe upcoming film was directed by James Wan, who mastered the horror world with films like The Conjuring and Insidious before making the leap to big-budget actions films with Furious 7. Kidman teased that Aquaman will appeal to fans of a variety of demographics.\n\n""I got to lie on a rock with my hair strewn, and blood,"" Kidman pointed out. ""And I kind of liked it.""\n\nWan also teased that the world he\'s exploring in the film marks uncharted territory for the filmmaker.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe water world my movie takes place in is so separate and so far apart from previous DC movies it\xe2\x80\x99s like I\xe2\x80\x99m making my own sci-fi fantasy film,\xe2\x80\x9d Wan shared with Entertainment Weekly. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is a whole new underwater world nobody has seen before in live action.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nFans of Aquaman enjoyed his appearance in Justice League, though the ways in which his underwater encounters were handled left much to be desired. According to former president of DC Entertainment Geoff Johns, the new film will appease devout fans.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe underwater stuff has never been executed like this before,\xe2\x80\x9d Johns confessed. \xe2\x80\x9cThe visual effects shots coming in are just beautiful. James can switch modes from horror to big bright colorful action to really emotional scenes. He\xe2\x80\x99s so able to hit all these different genres.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nFootage from the film was recently screened at CineEurope, likely confirming audiences\' first look at an Aquaman trailer debuting in the near future.\n\nAquaman lands in theaters on December 21.\n\nHow do you think Atlanna looks in the new image?

"b'Admitting they gave it their ""best college try""\n\nOne of the most telling interviews about the divorce was Lambert\'s chat with Cosmopolitan for its January 2016 issue.\n\nDuring the interview, the ""Tin Man"" singer said she wasn\'t going to ""live in fear"" about possibly missing her shot at a happily ever after. However, she suggested she still had some healing to do.\n\n""I think I\'m still gonna go through all those bunch,"" she replied when asked if she\'d done through the various grieving stages. ""I\'m sure I have a hundred more heartbreaks ahead of me. We all do. But I\'m a songwriter, so I\'m okay with it. My favorite records are not because people lived fully happy lives. There are pockets of sadness.""\n\nShe also said she was ""not going to be one of those artists who wallows in my misery so I can be artistic.""\n\n""I just want to live a life full of everything,"" she told the magazine. ""Some of that might mean nights on my porch crying, drinking whiskey, and going, \xe2\x80\x98Man, this sucks right now.\' I don\'t necessarily want to know that I have really bad, long, lonely nights ahead of me, but I have had some, and I still have a bunch ahead of me.

So I know what good is,"" she told Cosmoplitan at one point. ""I have a great launching pad for the future. I will never take that for granted.""\n\nAnd even though she told the magazine she gave the marriage ""everything"" she had, she also admitted that marriage is a ""tough business.""\n\n""We were together for 10 years, married for four, were very quickly divorced, and are friends. I\'m still processing everything and figuring out where to go and what happened,"" she told Cosmopolitan. ""[Marriage is] a tough business, and we gave it our best college try. I met him at 21\xe2\x80\x94I am now almost 32. You change as people. If I\'m not a different person than I was at 21, then something\'s wrong with me.

"b'It\xe2\x80\x99s only been a year since Beyonc\xc3\xa9 broke the internet when she gave birth to not one but two babies with her husband, Jay-Z. But is she already ready for another one? The BeyHive sure think so after the 36-year-old singer was photographed with what fans claim to be a very obvious baby bump.\n\nTo prove their theory, many fans are referencing a video from a recent concert on Beyonc\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s On the Run Tour II with Jay-Z. The video shows Beyonc\xc3\xa9 in a sparkly white outfit with what fans are confident is a small baby bump sticking out of her midsection.\n\nIn addition to Star magazine (a not-so-reliable tabloid, if we\xe2\x80\x99re being honest) reporting that the singer is \xe2\x80\x9cover the moon\xe2\x80\x9d with her pregnancy, fans are also referencing a tour outfit that they believe is a secret message from Beyonc\xc3\xa9 herself, proving that she\xe2\x80\x99s pregnant. The outfit, a skin-tight gold dress that Beyonc\xc3\xa9 pairs with a giant cape, features a heart on her midsection, which many fans believe represents her baby\xe2\x80\x99s heartbeat.Given Bey and Jay-Z\xe2\x80\x99s love for the number four (4:44 is the title of Jay-Z\xe2\x80\x99s last album and their wedding anniversary is on April 4), it makes sense that the couple is expecting their fourth child, as fans have noted. Needless to say, the BeyHive is alive with speculation (and worry that Bey might cancel the rest of her tour to go on maternity leave.)\n\nAs excited as we would be for another Beyonc\xc3\xa9 pregnancy, it\xe2\x80\x99s important to note that neither she nor Jay-Z have confirmed anything. And until they do, all rumors are speculation. Likewise, as Lili Reinhart, Drew Barrymore, Blac Chyna, and dozens of other celebrities who have fought off pregnancy rumors have proven, bloating is a real thing and assuming that someone is pregnant based on how much their stomach resembles a \xe2\x80\x9cbaby bump\xe2\x80\x9d is dangerous and a form of body-shaming.\n\nWe get it.

"b'Kate Middleton is calling off her third pregnancy plans, mostly because Prince William has apparently been an absentee father. The Duchess of Cambridge has made it no secret that she\xe2\x80\x99s unhappy with her current situation at home.\n\nIn a new Heads Together clip with Prince William and Prince Harry, Kate Middleton hints that she\xe2\x80\x99s done having children. She struggled so much after the birth of her first child, Prince George. Kate recalled how she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t prepared for all the life changes that come after having your first child. During Kate\xe2\x80\x99s heartfelt confession, William sat next to her in silence.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaving a child, particularly your first child, is such a life-changing moment,\xe2\x80\x9d Kate said in the clip. \xe2\x80\x9cNothing can really prepare you for that. Remember the first few days with little George, you have no idea what really you are doing, no matter how many books you read, nothing can prepare you for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nKate Middleton has made it no secret that she often feels lonely and isolated at home. Clearly, she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have many close friends to turn to. And, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t look like Prince William is helping their situation, either. Kate\xe2\x80\x99s supposedly been using a secret account on the popular mom forum Mumset for advice on how to parent her two children, Prince George and Princess Charlotte, at home.\n\nOften times she finds herself butting heads with her husband simply because of their different backgrounds and upbringings. Simply put, Kate Middleton doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want her children to have the same, stiff royal upbringing that Prince William experienced. She wants to be more hands-on with her children.\n\nBut if Kate can\xe2\x80\x99t handle raising two kids on her own, there\xe2\x80\x99s simply no way that she\xe2\x80\x99ll manage three small children under the age of 5. That might be the reason why she\xe2\x80\x99s saying no to a third pregnancy. She doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to be left alone, angry and frustrated with the struggles of raising small children while her husband goes off on one of his ski trips with his pals.\n\nThen again, the only two people who really know what\xe2\x80\x99s going on behind closed doors are of course the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge themselves.

She showed off a video off on social media and writing \xe2\x80\x9cThank you Katy\xe2\x80\x9d, and saying \xe2\x80\x9cSo, I just got to my dressing room and found this actual olive branch. This means so much to me.\xe2\x80\x9d While only the start of the note can be seen, it appears to read \xe2\x80\x9cHey Old Friend \xe2\x80\x94 I\xe2\x80\x99ve been doing some reflecting on past miscommunications and hurt feelings between us. I really want to clear the air\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m deeply sorry.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTaylor made it clear she had accepted whatever else Katy had to say in her letter and now the pair\xe2\x80\x99s long feud is over. It all started when Katy allegedly lured away three dancers from Taylor\xe2\x80\x99s Red tour in 2013 to work on her Prismatic tour and Taylor vented about it to Rolling Stone, albeit not naming Katy directly. They\xe2\x80\x99ve since gone at each other in song, with Tay\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cBad Blood\xe2\x80\x9d and Katy\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cSwish Swish,\xe2\x80\x9d but the AI judge as softened up over the past year, openly wishing that they\xe2\x80\x99d put their past differences aside.'"
"b'Photo: BFA, Getty Images\n\nThanks to warped beauty standards, female body hair often comes attached to a stigma. More than 99 percent of American women reportedly remove their body hair, spending tens of thousands of dollars over the course of their lifetimes to wax, pluck, shave, epilate, thread, or laser unwanted fuzz off their bodies. Below, 25 women \xe2\x80\x94 from Victoria\xe2\x80\x99s Secret models to body-hair activists \xe2\x80\x94 get real about their own body hair (from eyebrows to pubes to leg hair), whether they choose to laser everything off, or let it grow out as nature intended.\n\nKim Kardashian\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have the hairiest forehead you could ever imagine, and I would always break out and get all cracky on my forehead just from all the hair that I had. So in high school, I would wax it off because there was just so much hair, and then I would laser it off a little bit. If you Google 2008 or 2007, I had the craziest, hairiest hairline, so I did laser it. Everyone would just Photoshop it every time I did a photo shoot [anyway]. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t really change the shape, I just got rid of all the baby hairs.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 People, March 2015\n\nRihanna\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I went to this wax salon, and she recognized me before I took my clothes off \xe2\x80\xa6 And then, you know, obviously, I\xe2\x80\x99m laying there in pain, and she just decides to bust out \xe2\x80\x94 and you know what, every time I get a wax, I always specify that the lady is old and speaks Russian or no English \xe2\x80\x94 and she was [a] 25-year-old American. And she was basically like, \xe2\x80\x98I know who you are. [Imitates wax-tearing noise.] You\xe2\x80\x99re Rihanna, aren\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x99 I was just like \xe2\x80\xa6 awkward. It was really awkward. It was probably one of the most awkward moments of my entire life. I just got up and I just got out of there.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 The Graham Norton Show, November 2010\n\nAdele\n\nOn whether her husband minds her unshaven legs: \xe2\x80\x9cHe has no choice. I\xe2\x80\x99ll have no man telling me to shave my fuckin\xe2\x80\x99 legs. Shave yours.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Vanity Fair, October 2016\n\nLeandra Medine\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy relationship with shaving and waxing is very strange. The reason I don\xe2\x80\x99t do anything to my arms is because I really don\xe2\x80\x99t mind the hair on them. Sometimes my husband asks me to shave it or to wax it and that really bothers me. I\xe2\x80\x99m not asking him to, like, wax his balls. So why should he tell me what to wax or what to shave? Right? \xe2\x80\xa6 Still, I think that my problem with bikini waxing in particular is that I am uncomfortable with having hair there, and I\xe2\x80\x99m uncomfortable about being uncomfortable. I almost want to remove my hair to take back being a woman, and have that be my feminist statement \xe2\x80\xa6 I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind how [my arm hair] looks, though, so I\xe2\x80\x99m not changing it. However, I do laser my mustache.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Man Repeller, July 2015\n\nCarrie Brownstein\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will say, as a woman, when you put a mustache on, you find out a lot of things about yourself \xe2\x80\xa6 There\xe2\x80\x99s just a certain swagger. Now I know why men, you know, grow out the facial hair. Like there is just a certain level of confidence but also just a certain level of sleaziness.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Wait Wait\xe2\x80\xa6Don\xe2\x80\x99t Tell Me!, March 2012\n\nPriyanka Chopra\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBrows need to be on point, and I prefer threading to waxing. Because your skin is so sensitive around your eye, waxing can create wrinkles. It\xe2\x80\x99s also really important for your eyebrows to be extremely well filled-in. If you have great eyebrows and a good lip, then you don\xe2\x80\x99t need anything else on your face. My mom used to do her own eyebrows when she was in school, so I\xe2\x80\x99ve known how to do [it] for years. If you have sensitive skin then it is kind of tricky \xe2\x80\x94 you have to find the right technician to do it. And when you find her, keep her! My hairstylist does it for me. Her name is Priyanka, actually \xe2\x80\x94 same as mine.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Into the Gloss, May 2015\n\nHarnaam Kaur\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was diagnosed with polycystic ovaries from a really young age, around the time I hit puberty. PCOS is a condition in which there is an imbalance in hormones within the female body, this has led me to have more male hormones than female ones, and it is also the reason to why I have a beard. I used to have my face waxed two to three times a week, and on the days I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t bear the pain I would simply shave \xe2\x80\xa6 I decided to keep my beard and step forward against society\xe2\x80\x99s expectations of what a woman should look like \xe2\x80\xa6 Today I am happy living as a young, beautiful, bearded woman. I have realized that this body is mine, I own it, I do not have any other body to live in, so I may as well love it unconditionally.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Rock N Roll Bride, June 2015\n\nPetra Collins\n\nOn shaving her pubic area: \xe2\x80\x9cI never really did. I guess I would like trim. And it was always something that I\xe2\x80\x99d be like, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to the beach, I\xe2\x80\x99m so embarrassed. Like, because I never really liked to shave. So I just didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what to wear because it was embarrassing \xe2\x80\xa6 Now, I just don\xe2\x80\x99t care \xe2\x80\xa6 [Women\xe2\x80\x99s body hair]\xe2\x80\x99s just something that is so not talked about that it\xe2\x80\x99s insane. Like, all shaving ads would not \xe2\x80\x94 there\xe2\x80\x99s no hair in the ads. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t even start with hair. They\xe2\x80\x99re shaving nothing. And I guess it\xe2\x80\x99s kind of the same thing with like menstrual blood \xe2\x80\xa6 I was finally like, wait, why do I do this every day and why do I buy things every day to get rid of something that my body\xe2\x80\x99s just trying to grow?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 StyleLikeU, June 2015\n\nGaby Hoffmann\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen people want me to talk about whether I think the bush is back, and if that\xe2\x80\x99s great for feminism, I\xe2\x80\x99m like, \xe2\x80\x98You know what\xe2\x80\x99s great for feminism? Respecting everybody\xe2\x80\x99s own choice.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\xa6 I don\xe2\x80\x99t give a shit if people want to wax everything off. If it makes you feel comfortable, by all means, do that. This is how I feel comfortable.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 The Telegraph, May 2016\n\nEva Longoria\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet a Brazilian wax. It makes sex better, orgasm-wise. It\xe2\x80\x99s like the difference between this [she pats her arm lightly] and this [rubs her arm] \xe2\x80\xa6 Believe me, the first time I did it, the technician did half, and I was like \xe2\x80\x98Stop!\xe2\x80\x99 She said, \xe2\x80\x98Sit down, I have to finish.\xe2\x80\x99 But then it gets easier. The more you do it, the less hair grows back. But yeah, I love it. I swear by it. Every woman should try a Brazilian wax once. And then the sex they have afterward will make them keep coming back!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Cosmopolitan, October 2005\n\nTina Fey\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cRemove your body hair only when necessary. Body hair is a constant annoyance. Mostly I just let it be. Until I have to go into a professional situation, and then I have to shave from head to toe.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 The Edit, December 2015\n\nKate Winslet\n\nOn her role in The Reader: \xe2\x80\x9cI had to grow the hair down there. But because of years of waxing, as all of us girls know, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t come back quite the way it used to. They even made me a merkin \xe2\x80\x94 a wig \xe2\x80\x94 because they were so concerned that I might not be able to grow enough.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Allure, June 2009\n\nChrissy Teigen\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWaxing for a shoot? Are you kidding? I shave my whole body every day. It\xe2\x80\x99s exhausting. Trust me. It\xe2\x80\x99s gotten to the point where it takes up more of my life than anything else.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Allure, April 2015\n\nCameron Diaz\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI figure there\xe2\x80\x99s a purpose for that hair. No matter how you enjoy grooming it throughout your life, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s like shave it all off, wax it all off, put a bull\xe2\x80\x99s-eye, birthday cake, I don\xe2\x80\x99t care. Just girls, think about not taking it all off forever. Permanency forever, ever, means forever. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t come back.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Chelsea Lately, March 2014\n\nJennifer Lopez\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t love waxing. I just don\xe2\x80\x99t like everybody \xe2\x80\xa6 up in the business, you know what I mean? I shave everywhere; the only thing I wax is my eyebrows. It\xe2\x80\x99s torture plucking the hairs out one by one \xe2\x80\xa6 I\xe2\x80\x99m not really a hairy person. I shave every few days; once the stubble comes in, I take it off right away. Today I\xe2\x80\x99ve changed my outfit six times for shoots, and there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of going from pants to a short skirt, so I keep a razor in my travel kit. In a pinch, I\xe2\x80\x99ve grabbed a water spray bottle from the hairdresser, mixed it with some lotion, and shaved my legs in under a minute.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Allure, February 2011\n\nKate Somerville\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hate to say this, but personally I get hairs above my upper lip, and have forever. Initially I [shaved] it because of the hair, but then I noticed that it was a great exfoliant and that my makeup went on a lot better.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 The New York Times, June 2015\n\nEmma Watson\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s funny \xe2\x80\x94 I was just talking to my friend before this about how in the Instagram era it\xe2\x80\x99s so easy to edit your life so that it looks perfect. But I bleach my top lip and tweeze my eyebrows and you\xe2\x80\x99d never get to see that, even though it\xe2\x80\x99s a part of my routine. There\xe2\x80\x99s still so much shame around the things you do to get ready while you\xe2\x80\x99ve got a towel wrapped around your head. It\xe2\x80\x99s important to me not to edit that out. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been bleaching my top lip since I was nine. I don\xe2\x80\x99t do it very often, but I do it! There\xe2\x80\x99s that, and I use Fur Oil. I\xe2\x80\x99ll use that anywhere from the ends of my hair to my eyebrows to my pubic hair. It\xe2\x80\x99s an amazing all-purpose product.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Into The Gloss, March 2017\n\nRita Ora\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I\xe2\x80\x99m not working and getting my makeup done, that\xe2\x80\x99s my chance to do a hair mask and a face mask and my plucking and waxing and all of that \xe2\x80\xa6Eyebrows are really important because they structure the face. In school it was funny because I was always the one walking around with tweezers plucking my girlfriends\xe2\x80\x99 eyebrows. I was really good; eyebrow tweezing runs in my family \xe2\x80\x94 my mother used to do mine, and I picked it up. Then I started plucking my friends\xe2\x80\x99 brows when I would see them at school. Suddenly there ended up being a line at lunchtime of people who wanted to get their eyebrows tweezed.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Into The Gloss, August 2014\n\nMadonna\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c[G]oing to high school, I saw how popular girls had to behave to get the boys. I knew I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t fit into that. So I decided to do the opposite. I refused to wear makeup, to have a hairstyle. I refused to shave. I had hairy armpits \xe2\x80\xa6 The boys in my school would make fun of me. \xe2\x80\x98Hairy monster.\xe2\x80\x99 You know, things like that.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Harper\xe2\x80\x99s Bazaar, November 2011\n\nMo\xe2\x80\x99Nique\n\nOn her shaven legs: \xe2\x80\x9cOkay, let me tell you something \xe2\x80\xa6 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t [care about my leg hair]. And I still don\xe2\x80\x99t. But what happened was, as I got older, the hair began to fall out in different places. So one night, Sid [her husband] and I were in the closet, and he said \xe2\x80\x98Mama, you\xe2\x80\x99re starting to have spots on your legs. It look like you got the mangy. So you got to do something about that.\xe2\x80\x99 So I shaved them that night and I\xe2\x80\x99ve been shaving them ever since \xe2\x80\xa6 If I still had it I would still wear it well.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 The Wendy Williams Show, April 2015\n\nBusy Philipps\n\nOn whether she waxes or shaves: \xe2\x80\x9cOh! I love this question. Actually, I wanted to talk to you about this, it\xe2\x80\x99s so weird. So I do get waxed, but after I had my daughter I had this real epiphany. I felt like it would be really fucking weird if I had no hair on my vagina, because I have a little girl and I want her to look at me and think that grown women have hair on their vaginas!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 The Conversation with Amanda de Cadenet, May 2013\n\nGrimes\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI just started shaving for the first time this year. I am rebelling against my previous body hair, because now people get mad when I shave my legs. So I\xe2\x80\x99m like, \xe2\x80\x98I have the right to shave my legs.\xe2\x80\x99 I think people policing my body either way is bizarre \xe2\x80\xa6 There is still an intense vibe in society about body hair. No one I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever dated has mentioned it. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t even think it was weird until I started doing fashion and people would be putting concealer over my legs.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Teen Vogue, April 2016\n\nCharlotte Free\n\nOn her unshaven armpits: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s an equal-rights thing. It\xe2\x80\x99s ridiculous that women have to shave their armpits and legs every day. I don\xe2\x80\x99t have time. I think it\xe2\x80\x99s asinine that men have this standard that women should be perfectly shaven \xe2\x80\xa6 I only shave them once in a blue moon for a really big job. I like to keep my body hair. It\xe2\x80\x99s a symbol of how I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to conform to something that\xe2\x80\x99s so ridiculous.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 The Guardian, March 2012\n\nMayim Bialik\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder if I had a girl if she would find me odd and embarrassing, or if whatever we present to our children about us, whether they be girls or boys, is simply what we teach them we are. Meaning, if we never told girls to shave, would they? If we modeled a cultural acceptance of our body hair, would they spontaneously feel the need to remove it weekly, monthly, or daily? If we all wore bathing suits that covered our natural forms instead of the form that only hairless young girls who have not birthed babies can wear, would our girls and boys have a more or less realistic notion of what the human body \xe2\x80\x98should\xe2\x80\x99 look like?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Kveller, July 2012\n\nMolly Soda\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cChoosing to shave doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that you\xe2\x80\x99re insecure. The strongest statement you can make is to take control of your body and present yourself in whatever way that makes you feel comfortable. Shave one leg and don\xe2\x80\x99t shave the other, shave sometimes, never shave \xe2\x80\xa6 it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter. All that matters is that you feel good about you. That\xe2\x80\x99s the boldest and bravest thing you can do.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Nylon, April 2016'"

"b""Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton are still going strong after meeting on The Voice years ago. But many are wondering if they will ever walk down the aisle and how they will do it \xe2\x80\x94 so much so that a country singer has already offered to officiate their ceremony.\n\nSo what exactly are their marriage plans? Here are seven things to know, including the one country singer who wants to officiate the couple\xe2\x80\x99s wedding.\n\n1. Shelton might have dissed ex Miranda Lambert on Twitter\n\nAlthough Shelton and Stefani have been dating three years now, he might still have some resentful feelings for his ex-wife, Miranda Lambert. He tweeted, \xe2\x80\x9cBeen taking the high road for a long time.. I almost gave up. But I can finally see something on the horizon up there!! Wait!! Could it be?! Yep!! It\xe2\x80\x99s karma!!\xe2\x80\x9d on April 25.\n\nSo what could this be referring to? In Touch Weekly reports Lambert has moved on to dating Evan Felker who is still technically married to Staci Felker. Felker filed for divorce in February of 2018. He reportedly struck up his relationship with Lambert after the split.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re figuring it out. It\xe2\x80\x99s in the early stages; they\xe2\x80\x99re still getting to know each other,\xe2\x80\x9d an insider said. There also might be a sore spot there because Miranda Lambert, Blake Shelton, and Gwen Stefani were in the same room recently for the American Country Music Awards.\n\nShelton and Stefani mostly stuck to themselves. Otherwise, the couple seems to be doing well.\n\nNext: This is what Shelton said about the marriage rumors.\n\n\n\n2. Shelton and Stefani joke about marriage rumors\n\nThe celebrity couple is pretty aware of the marriage rumors swirling around them. In an interview, Shelton said \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if you guys read the magazines, but we\xe2\x80\x99ve been married for a while. It\xe2\x80\x99s been on the cover of all the credible magazines!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNext: A source said this is how they really feel about marriage.\n\n\n\n3. A source said they are happy with their relationship the way it is\n\nAlthough there have been reports that the couple could be getting married, there are sources saying it\xe2\x80\x99s not really a priority for them.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no reason for them to rush into a marriage, so they aren\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d a source said according to ET. \xe2\x80\x9cBoth of them are happy and content with where their relationship is right now.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNext: Stefani reveals she thinks about marriage.\n\n\n\n4. Stefani said she thinks about marrying Shelton \xe2\x80\x98all the time\xe2\x80\x99\n\nDuring her appearance on Ellen DeGeneres\xe2\x80\x99 show, Stefani was grilled about whether they will be walking down the aisle.\n\nWhen DeGeneres told her to think about getting married, she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI do, I think about it all the time.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNext: This country singer wants to officiate their wedding.\n\n\n\n5. Luke Bryan wants to officiate their ceremony\n\nThe one country singer that wants to help on the big day is Luke Bryan. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll do the sermon. The sermon? The service?\xe2\x80\x9d told ET. \xe2\x80\x9cI would be honored to marry Blake and Gwen.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNext: This is why Bryan thinks they should get married.\n\n\n\n6. Bryan joked that Shelton needs to hurry up and get married\n\nBryan thinks the couple getting hitched quickly would be best for Shelton.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf Blake were smart, he would marry her before she goes to an optometrist,\xe2\x80\x9d he said according to ET. \xe2\x80\x9cEvery time I meet Gwen, she\xe2\x80\x99s holding her phone way out here. I\xe2\x80\x99m like, \xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s it, she can\xe2\x80\x99t see!'\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNext: This is what Shelton said about Bryan\xe2\x80\x99s offer.\n\n\n\n7. Shelton rejects Bryan\xe2\x80\x99s offer\n\nBryan won\xe2\x80\x99t be officiating the ceremony, given Shelton\xe2\x80\x99s response. \xe2\x80\x9cLuke\xe2\x80\x99s not even a legitimate country artist, much less like somebody that can marry people, you know what I\xe2\x80\x99m saying,\xe2\x80\x9d Shelton joked on The Voice.\n\nFollow Nicole Weaver on Twitter @nikkibernice.\n\nCheck out The Cheat Sheet on Facebook!"""
"b'On the same day rumors spread that there\xe2\x80\x99s trouble in paradise for Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani, another shocking report claims Miranda Lambert is desperately trying to meet up with her ex!\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s been more than two years since Blake Shelton, 40, and Miranda Lambert, 33, ended their marriage, but she\xe2\x80\x99s finally ready to sit down and hash things out, according to a new report. Amidst new rumors that Blake is having trouble in his relationship with Gwen Stefani, 47, an insider tells InTouch that Miranda wants to confront her ex to finally get closure. \xe2\x80\x9cIt needs to be done,\xe2\x80\x9d the source tells the mag. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s still a lot of unfinished business between [Miranda] and Blake. She needs to look straight into Blake\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, ask certain questions, and get answers.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThere are no plans set for this meeting to actually take place just yet, but the mag claims that if it does happen, Miranda plans to go in with a \xe2\x80\x9cclear head,\xe2\x80\x9d although that might not be so easy. \xe2\x80\x9cThis could get heated,\xe2\x80\x9d the insider admits. \xe2\x80\x9cAs soon as the emotions come up, [Miranda] may lose it.\xe2\x80\x9d This doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean the 33-year-old wants to get back together with her ex, though \xe2\x80\x94 actually, it\xe2\x80\x99s just the opposite. She\xe2\x80\x99s very happy with her man, Anderson East, 29, but feels a face-to-face with Blake is what she needs to fully be ready to commit to another relationship, according to the source.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe feels that [she and Blake] have both grown so much since their divorce that meeting up is essential for them to have healthy relationships in the future,\xe2\x80\x9d InTouch\xe2\x80\x99s insider says. \xe2\x80\x9cWho knows, maybe this meeting with Blake will have them walk away as friends. Either way, they\xe2\x80\x99ll definitely be in a better place.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAs for the rumored trouble between Blake and Gwen, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to take that report (from OK! magazine) with a grain of salt. After all, they were just spotted looking totally in love on Aug. 20! Plus, HollywoodLife.com has heard EXCLUSIVELY that they already have plans for a fun Labor Day together, so hopefully he\xe2\x80\x99ll pop back up on her social media this weekend!\n\nHollywoodLifers, do you think Blake and Miranda will meet up?'"
"b'Kylie Jenner Is Afraid of Butterflies, Which Is Weird Because She Has a Tattoo of One\n\nHaving a baby definitely changes you! Now that Kylie Jenner is a mom \xe2\x80\x94 she just announced that she gave birth to her first child with her baby daddy Travis Scott \xe2\x80\x94 she definitely had a completely different mindset than most other 20-year-olds. Last June, fans were shocked when Kylie and Travis debuted their new matching butterfly tattoos, but now it all makes sense. She got the butterfly to symbolize her relationship with the father of her baby girl!\n\nWhat\xe2\x80\x99s more surprising is Kylie got a tattoo of an insect that she\xe2\x80\x99s afraid of!\n\nOver the summer, her show Life of Kylie, has really taught us a lot about the makeup mogul. In a clip from an episode from Season 1, Kylie and her BFF Jordyn Woods went to a zoo together. Too bad Ky learns that she\xe2\x80\x99s terrified of butterflies.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m scared if one lands on me!\xe2\x80\x9d the 20-year-old screamed as her friend laughed. Of course, the workers assured her that the butterflies are harmless, but she didn\xe2\x80\x99t care.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cButterflies are just part of the secrets of Kylie,\xe2\x80\x9d she said in a voiceover. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s kind of just ironic because I\xe2\x80\x99m terrified, terrified of butterflies. All butterflies. This is how I think of them: cut the wings off and if you just look at their bodies, they\xe2\x80\x99re not that pretty. It\xe2\x80\x99s literally a bug.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe irony came from the fact that she and boyfriend Travis Scott have matching tatoos of those \xe2\x80\x9cbugs.\xe2\x80\x9d Kylie got a mini butterfly above her right ankle while Travis, 25, got the same exact ink on his left ankle.\n\nThis isn\xe2\x80\x99t the first time the couple has shown their love using the winged insect. Over the course of their ten-month romance, they have sent each other cryptic messages on social media using the butterfly emoji, most likely inspired by Travis\xe2\x80\x99 song, \xe2\x80\x9cButterfly Effect\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe caught the waves just thumbin\xe2\x80\x99 through my braids (alright)/ Heatin\xe2\x80\x99 up, baby, I\xe2\x80\x99m just heatin\xe2\x80\x99 up (it\xe2\x80\x99s lit),\xe2\x80\x9d he rapped in the NSFW hit. \xe2\x80\x9cNeed ya love, not a need it is a must/ Feelin\xe2\x80\x99 stuck, you know how to keep me up.\xe2\x80\x9d And it looks like the song even inspired their baby\xe2\x80\x99s nursery room!\n\n(Photo Credit: YouTube)\n\nBack in June, Life & Style reported that Kylie and Travis may have made their relationship even more permanent by getting married in a super secret ceremony. \xe2\x80\x9cKylie and Travis tied the knot at her Calabasas mansion,\xe2\x80\x9d a source revealed. \xe2\x80\x9cIt wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a big, glamorous affair like other Kardashian weddings, and only a few close friends were invited. But Kylie is crazy about Travis.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe insider continued, \xe2\x80\x9cThere were no official E! cameras there, but Kylie asked her friends to film the special moment on their iPhones. She plans to use the footage on her new show.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAs expected, her ex-boyfriend Tyga was not thrilled. \xe2\x80\x9cTyga will be upset,\xe2\x80\x9d an insider said of the 27-year-old, who dated the lip kit mogul for almost three years. \xe2\x80\x9cBut he won\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily be surprised. He felt Kylie was so immature. The two of them together were just nothing but fighting and drama all the time.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTo see what other changes Kylie has made to her body, check out the gallery below!'"

"b'Swift calls out label for being \'nervous\' over pop album\n\nRyan O\'Connell | TheWrap\n\nA younger-than-normal audience packed The View\'s studio on Wednesday morning in order to see their pop idol Taylor Swift, live and in person. Swift\'s new album 1989 has already shot to the top on iTunes and has received favorable reviews from critics but her label, Big Machine Records, might not have been so confident that this offering from Swift would be a success.\n\n""I wasn\'t necessarily nervous about this album,"" Swift said. ""I think my label might have been a little nervous but they\'ll never say it now.""\n\nSwift, whose roots were initially planted in country music, is now going full-steam ahead into Top 40 fare with 1989.\n\n""I knew I wanted to change the way I did things creatively,"" Swift told the View co-hosts.

""I was never really taught the definition of feminism when I was a little girl and I wish I had been.""\n\nWhether her constant astonishment at her own overwhelming success is genuine or just false modesty is still undeterminable.

Just four days since reaching the legal age limit for models walking on the catwalk and a few after her first photo shoot for British Vogue was released, the daughter of Cindy Crawford made her runway debut in Raf Simons\'s sophomore Calvin Klein 205W39NYC collection. And what a debut it was.\n\n\n\nTaking the fourth-exit slot in a black-and-white stiff-collared shirt with canary-yellow trousers and a colour-pop turquoise polo-neck, Kaia transformed from the all-American girl we know and love her to be to a new-gen mid-West cowgirl. It was a look that Jessie from Toy Story would definitely not resist slipping into.\n\n\n\nSpeaking of her big debut, Kaia took to Instagram to share enthusiasm for her first booking. ""There are no words to describe how I feel"", she wrote. ""I love you endlessly Raf!""\n\n\n\nGrowing up in a household where catwalking is a normal everyday profession - Kaia\'s brother Presley has already followed in their mother\'s footsteps and walked in shows including Balmain, Dolce & Gabbana and Moschino - her debut walk in front of every single big-name editor came with a nonchalant ease that has already seen her being booked for the Alexander Wang and Fenty x Puma and Coach shows.\n\n\n\nBut Kaia\'s first fashion week didn\'t end in New York. The model travelled across the pond to join her brother on Christopher Bailey\'s September show catwalk.\n\n\n\nIn pictorial form, go inside Kaia\'s first run of shows:'"

"b'\xe2\x80\x9cMitch,\xe2\x80\x9d I whispered. \xe2\x80\x9cStrong, the last three consonants, that is, but not in a harsh way, in a soft way.

Put that and the last together, soft and strong, things a cop needs to be\xe2\x80\xa6 Mitch.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe stared at me.\n\nI kept babbling. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd Lawson, goes without saying, Law\xe2\x80\xa6 son. Son of the law.\xe2\x80\x9d I pulled in a breath through my nose and then whispered, \xe2\x80\x9cPerfect.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want him,\xe2\x80\x9d I whispered my secret.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen talk to him,\xe2\x80\x9d Cam whispered back.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wanted him to be special,\xe2\x80\x9d I kept whispering. \xe2\x80\x9c\n\nGirl,\xe2\x80\x9d she kept whispering too and got closer, wrapping her fingers around my arm, \xe2\x80\x9ctalk to him\xe2\x80\xa6..\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll always be filler,\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n[okay he\xe2\x80\x99d slept with other women in the course of their 1.5 year booty call and I was super mad at him for awhile. But\xe2\x80\xa6then I realized that she never initiated a single conversation in all the time they were sleeping together and hard to work out the acceptables of your relationship when you\xe2\x80\x99ve never really talked to the man. Gwen could have changed her situation at any time. (hide spoiler)\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99re you?\xe2\x80\x9d Elvira demanded to know, eyeing up Cam and Cam looked at her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGwen\xe2\x80\x99s best friend,\xe2\x80\x9d Cam answered.\n\nTracy had made it to the bar and she leaned both forearms into it, saying to Elvira, \xe2\x80\x9cWe share that title.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nElvira looked over her shoulder at me where I was positioning myself at the back counter. \xe2\x80\x9cIf that\xe2\x80\x99s true, girl, you better make up your mind \xe2\x80\x99cause you can\xe2\x80\x99t have two maids of honor.\n\nI always feel like I have to give this disclaimer with KA books but maybe even more-so with this one\xe2\x80\xa6. There are very specific reasons why that is the case but mostly it is because it isn\xe2\x80\x99t your usual boy meets girl story. It\xe2\x80\x99s more of a boy sees girl, boy thinks girl is hot, boy takes girl to bed and then sneaks into her house to pretty much booty call her for a year and a half without her even knowing his name.In most KA book I suspend disbelief because I always seem to like the emotional journey she takes me on. So while I can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine being Gwen and seeing the hot stranger in a restaurant and taking him home without much conversation including the general niceties such as \xe2\x80\x98what\xe2\x80\x99s your name\xe2\x80\x99 I totally love the dangerous idea of it.and in that world Alpha men have little to no boundaries and they sneak into your house a few days later for some of the best sex of your life and then continue to do that intermittently for over a year.Too bad her stupid selfish sister has to screw it all up and turn Gwen\xe2\x80\x99s life upside down. After getting into a little trouble it seems that Gwen has been pulled into her sisters problems which also introduces her to many hot men from so different areas in life including H O T cop Mitch Lawson (totally going to read his book). I little flirting with him brings out night lovers slightly jealous side so that he wants to make a claim and make sure that Gwen knows she\xe2\x80\x99s totally his.I LOVE IT!!! But it seems Hawk (previously unnamed nighttime visitor) is not happy about all the sudden Alpha males interested in his girl on the down low.Okay so there are a few things\xe2\x80\xa6..One\xe2\x80\xa6.I was totally loving the story and the new relationship status that Gwen is having with Hawk even though she is really fighting that every step of the way and then KA dropped the emotional bomb on me and I WAS NOT READY\xe2\x80\xa6..and I hated Hawk. Yep you heard me\xe2\x80\xa6I hated him because he hurt her feelings so much with some of his other \xe2\x80\x98activities\xe2\x80\x99 while they were having night time visits, and by visits I just mean sex together. And Gwen killed me with her reaction when we all found out what the bomb was.And Gwenny was totally hurt and I was hurt with her and Hawk was the biggest asshole around. (view spoiler) . I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying I was happy about it but I\xe2\x80\x99ll give it a pass this time based on the parameters of the situation.Two\xe2\x80\xa6..there are some H O T alpha men in this and all of them seem to meet Gwen and get an instant hard on for her. Like she must be putting off some serious pheromones for the amount of tuff guy interest in her. Still I\xe2\x80\x99m going to allow it based on this being a KA book and that I enjoyed it. But seriously it\xe2\x80\x99s like she smelled like a steak and they all wanted a big bite.Three\xe2\x80\xa6.There are some great side characters. I loved all her friends and Elvira the secretary for Hawk\xe2\x80\x99s place of work was the absolute best. She got away with saying some crazy fun stuff and just inserted herself into Gwen\xe2\x80\x99s life like she\xe2\x80\x99d been there all along. I totally loved it.Four\xe2\x80\xa6.this is a bit alpha over the top even for one of KAs books so just be prepared and roll with it. Hawk is all alpha all the time and like many KA heroes he might be a bit broken so we all know that he will do something stupid because he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know how to deal with the situation. But I has some great intense emotional reactions in this to his backstory and how Gwen came to terms with both her past and his.Overall I enjoyed the story and while this by no means has any place in the real world the story for the most part worked for me and now I need to get to know all the Mystery Men.'"
"b'Just when you think literally no stone has been left unturned when it comes to Kylie Jenner\'s reported pregnancy, another headline or five emerges. Today\'s, featuring a theory from her fans that\'s made some serious waves since it broke, is a big one. According to Twitter, Kylie hasn\'t been MIA lately because she\'s hiding a baby bump\xe2\x80\x94instead, fans believe she\'s been keeping out of the spotlight because she already had the baby. (Yep, you read that right.)\n\nOf course, let\'s remember that Kylie in no way is obligated to give us an explanation: It\'s completely up to her if and when she\'s comfortable sharing her own news. But Kylie is a public figure, and Twitter exists. Remember how on Monday everyone was super bummed when the Kardashian family\'s Christmas card did not, as many hoped, confirm Jenner\'s rumored pregnancy? And then some very dedicated fans unearthed a couple blurry photos that appear to show her with a baby bump\xe2\x80\x94dated from all the way back to September?\n\nNow twitterers are saying that, based on the size of her supposed bump in those photos from three months ago (which, BTW, is in no way ""proof"" of anything), the youngest Kardashian-Jenner sister must have had her baby by now. Another, auxiliary, theory: Jenner is for sure going to announce the birth on New Year\'s Eve, so we won\'t have to wait too much longer. And there\'s yet another theory about the Christmas card reveal.\n\nRelated Stories\n\n-Everyone Is Speculating About This New Photo of Kylie Jenner and Travis Scott\n\n-Kylie Jenner Is Still Missing from the Kardashian-Jenner Christmas Card, and Fans Are Suspicious\n\n-Kylie Jenner Claps Back at Paparazzi for Photoshopping a Baby Bump'"

"b'With all the hype surrounding Hollywood\xe2\x80\x99s recent awards shows, it appears the men of the red carpet have been the center of the A-Lister\xe2\x80\x99s gossip ring.\n\nAnd no- it\xe2\x80\x99s not for looking handsome, or wearing that amazing Tom Ford tuxedo.\n\nThey\xe2\x80\x99re actually taking some heat for self tanning!\n\nWhen I read that, my jaw dropped.\n\nI (along with millions of other women) thought the bronzed studs such as Leonardo DiCaprio, George Clooney and Bradley Cooper, looked great.\n\nFor some reason, there seems to be a stigma surrounding men using self and spray tanners.\n\nSince when is self tanning only for women?\n\nI know many men who want to maintain some color without damaging their skin, and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you do as well.\n\nI for one, am more likely to notice a guy who has a nice tan going on, rather than one who is so white you can see his veins (although Edward Cullen may be the one exception).\n\nWhen I see a man who is extremely pale, I think he looks sickly and that he spends too much time playing video games ;)\n\nWhen a man has a a nice self tan (even if it\xe2\x80\x99s just a little), he tends to look healthier, and it also shows he takes pride in his appearance.\n\nMen should be encouraged to use self tanners, it\xe2\x80\x99s a great alternative to tanning beds and/or laying in the sun (both which can lead to skin cancer and wrinkles).\n\nThere are also many self tanners out there that are specifically geared towards men. Big names such as Fake Bake and Anthony Logistics for Men have created tanners that cater to men!\n\nTruth be told, both men and women can benefit from self tanning (not just Bradley Cooper).\n\nBy applying self tanner, you can automatically accentuate muscles, cover imperfections, smooth out your skin tone and even mask cellulite.\n\nTo me, it seems like a no-brainer to use one right before a national awards show. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, but no male (or person) should get ridiculed for trying to better their appearance.\n\nThis goes for all you women out there as well.\n\nNow, I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying to over-do it.\n\nYou don\xe2\x80\x99t want to end up looking like a cast member from Jersey Shore. But a little color or sunkissed glow never hurt anyone.\n\nJessica Biel and Angelina Jolie both looked amazing at the 2014 Oscars, and do you know what they had in common? That\xe2\x80\x99s right, a tan!\n\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s nothing worse than seeing one of Hollywood\xe2\x80\x99s hottest bombshells blend in with her ivory/white dress.\n\nNow, don\xe2\x80\x99t forget self tanning is not just for A-Listers, and it\xe2\x80\x99s definitely not just for red carpet events.\n\nMaintaining your tan on an ongoing basis will help boost your confidence, not to mention make you more attractive to the opposite sex.\n\nBut most importantly, self tanning will save your skin.\n\nYou\xe2\x80\x99ll be thanking yourself years down the road when you avoided wrinkles from tanning beds, or even worse, skin cancer.\n\nSo overall, there aren\xe2\x80\x99t many downsides to self tanning.\n\nHey, if celebs like Bradley Cooper and Leonardo DiCaprio are doing it, I\xe2\x80\x99d say it\xe2\x80\x99s worth a try!\n\nCategory: Celebrity Self Tanning, Is This Celebrity Self Tanning?, Rate This Celebrity Self Tan!, Self Tanning For Men'"

"b'Portia de Rossi believes that people\xe2\x80\x99s perceptions of same-sex marriage changed for the better when she tied the knot with Ellen DeGeneres in 2008. But some negativity ensued, too.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe divorce rumors came and then we really knew the perceptions had changed,\xe2\x80\x9d the Arrested Development star, 45, told Us Weekly exclusively at the General Public x RH Celebration in West Hollywood on Wednesday, June 27. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not kidding. I know it sounds ridiculous, but when that started happening I thought, \xe2\x80\x98Oh, now we\xe2\x80\x99re finally accepted.\xe2\x80\x99 We get the same s\xe2\x80\x93t as every celebrity couple.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSplit rumors aren\xe2\x80\x99t the only ones that de Rossi has faced. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought, \xe2\x80\x98Wow, this is great that I\xe2\x80\x99m pregnant, not pregnant, divorced, not divorced, whatever,\xe2\x80\x9d she added. \xe2\x80\x9cThat means there is an acceptance for this.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe actress said she and DeGeneres, 60, don\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily laugh off the speculation. In fact, they try to ignore it completely.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was at a newsstand \xe2\x80\xa6 and there was a cover of Brad [Pitt] and Jen [Aniston],\xe2\x80\x9d she recalled. \xe2\x80\x9cI literally just stared at it, and I was like, \xe2\x80\x98They haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen each other. \xe2\x80\xa6 How is this even a thing? I know for a fact.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\xa6 I actually took a picture of it and sent it to Ellen and said, \xe2\x80\x98Can you believe this?\xe2\x80\x99 Anyway, no, in other words, we avoid it. We don\xe2\x80\x99t care.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nDe Rossi also spoke with Us about launching The Ellen DeGeneres Wildlife Fund in honor of her wife\xe2\x80\x99s birthday in January. \xe2\x80\x9cAll of it was a complete surprise, which was very difficult. It was so difficult to keep it from her,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s so observant. I literally had to take my email address off all of our shared devices at home \xe2\x80\xa6 because I knew that if she saw an email coming in from Africa, it would be all over. She would put it all together.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe philanthropist explained that she wanted to do something special for the TV host\xe2\x80\x99s milestone day. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought this was a big birthday, 60, and she\xe2\x80\x99s not going to do her talk show forever, and I want her to be able to look forward to retiring, to know that there was something the entertainment industry that she could sink her teeth into,\xe2\x80\x9d she told Us. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was those two things.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIn addition, de Rossi opened up about how her company, General Public, partnered with Restoration Hardware. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m an art lover and collector. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t call myself an expert, I\xe2\x80\x99m just a fan,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI saw the disparity between the quality of art that you can get in the fine art market and decorative art that is available to most people. I just thought that it was kind of a shame that you have to be extremely interested in art \xe2\x80\x94 or interested enough to go to an art gallery or learn the art market \xe2\x80\x94 in order to get a better quality of art than what is available.

"b'Anna Wintour Net Worth and Salary: Anna Wintour is an American magazine editor and fashion news icon. Anna Wintour has a net worth of $50 million. Her annual salary as Editor of Vogue is $4 million. She is considered one of the most influential figures in the fashion industry. She served as the iconic (albeit not very flattering) inspiration for the popular novel and movie ""The Devil Wears Prada.""\n\nEarly Life: Anna Wintour was born November 3, 1949 in Hampstead, London. Her career began in the world of fashion before moving into journalism, largely at the behest of her parents. Her father Charles Wintour was the editor of the London Evening Standard for nearly two decades. Her parents were married for nearly forty years before divorcing in 1979. She has four siblings. Her older brother Gerald sadly died in a car accident when they were children. Wintour attended North London Collegiate School and started dating older, well-connected men in her teens. Wintour\'s father arranged her first job for her, at Bib boutique, when he was 15.\n\nEarly Career: She left North London Collegiate and began a training program at Harrods while taking fashion classes at a nearby school. In 1970, Wintour was hired on as an editorial assistant for the new Harper\'s & Queen fashion magazine. Even at this early stage of her career, Wintour divulged to coworkers that she had the desire to edit Vogue, (a desire that would grow to be fulfilled nearly 20 years later.) After many disagreements with her rival, Min Hogg, Anna quit the magazine and moved to New York with her boyfriend Jon Bradshaw.\n\nAt home in her new country, Anna started working as a junior fashion editor at Harper\'s Bazaar in 1975. However, she was fired after just nine months for trying to put forth daring, risque, and innovative shoots. A few months later, she got her first position at Viva as a fashion editor. However, the magazine shut down due to being unprofitable in 1978. Wintour took time off work and broke up with Bradshaw, starting a new relationship with French record producer Michel Estaban. For two years, she would divide her time between Paris and New York. Wintour returned to work in 1980 and became the fashion editor for New York. Wintour finally got her chance to work for Vogue when Alex Liberman, editorial director for Conde Nast (the publisher of Vogue) clued Anna in about a position there in 1983. Wintour got the position and immediately doubled her salary when she became the magazine\'s first creative director. In 1985, Wintour obtained her first editorship when she took over the UK edition of Vogue after Beatrix Miller retired. She replaced much of the staff and exerted more control over the magazine than previous editors had, which earned her the nickname Nuclear Wintour.\n\nIn 1987, Conde Nast requested Wintour take over House & Garden, whose readership was flailing and lagging behind Architectural Digest. She did indeed make sweeping changes: cancelling $2 million worth of photo spreads and articles in her first week and packing so much fashion onto the pages that it earned the nickname House & Garment. Ten months later, Anna Wintour became the editor of U.S. Vogue.\n\nVogue: Wintour again introduced sweeping changes to Vogue from her first issue forward. Many of these changes could be seen right on the cover. Wintour favored more naturalistic photography of lesser-known models outside, as opposed to the tight headshots the magazine had previously favored. Additionally, Wintour\'s first Vogue cover was also the first to feature a model wearing jeans, with the added bonus of wearing a bejeweled T-shirt valued at around $10,000.\n\nBy the 2000s, Wintour had solidified her grasp on Vogue\'s artistic direction and had become a household name. The September 2004 issue was the largest issue of a monthly magazine ever published at that time, sitting at a whopping 832 pages. Wintour oversaw the introduction of three magazine spinoffs: Teen Vogue, Vogue Living, and Men\'s Vogue. Teen Vogue has gone on to become an extremely popular entity, earning more advertiser revenue than either Elle Girl or Cosmo Girl.\n\n2006 saw the release of ""The Devil Wears Prada"", with a character based off of Wintour. The film transformed her image into a cultural icon versus just a public figure. Rumors began to fly in 2008 that Wintour had lost her touch and was set to retire, but she disputed that rumor on a ""60 Minutes"" profile. In 2013, Conde Nast announced Wintour would be taking the position of artistic director while still remaining at Vogue. In 2014, Wintour was named by Forbes magazine as the 39th most powerful woman in the world. That same year, the Metropolitan Museum of Art named its Costume Institute complex after Wintour, with First Lady Michelle Obama opening. In May 2017, Wintour was created a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire at a ceremony at Buckingham Palace for her contributions to fashion journalism. Under Wintour, Vogue has continued to be one of the pillars of fashion journalism.\n\nPersonal Life: Anna was married to David Shaffer from 1984 to 1999. They have two children: Charles (b. 1985) and Katherine (b. 1987). Katherine, also known as Bee, wrote columns for The Daily Telegraph in 2006, but has said she has no desire to follow her mother into the fashion world. Wintour married business investor Shelby Bryan in 2004.\n\nWintour is involved with many charities. She serves as a trustee of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where she organizes benefits that have raised over $50 million. Wintour started the CFDA Vogue Fund in order to mentor and support unknown fashion designers. Wintour has raised over $10 million for AIDS charities since 1990. She resides in Greenwich Village.'"
"b'Jennifer Aniston is single and ready to mingle! We\xe2\x80\x99ve got EXCLUSIVE details on why she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mind being a \xe2\x80\x98cougar\xe2\x80\x99 in her next relationship!\n\nIt seems like only yesterday Jennifer Aniston, 49, and Justin Theroux, 46, ended their two year marriage. The couple confirmed their shocking split on Feb. 15, leaving the world devastated. However, being that the Just Go With It actress has had over a month to recover, she\xe2\x80\x99s ready to hit the dating scene. But interestingly, she\xe2\x80\x99s not looking to settle down. \xe2\x80\x9cJen doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to take her next relationship that seriously and just would like to have fun with someone without falling in love. She thinks if she was with a younger guy that she could achieve that because she feels a younger guy doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to settle down,\xe2\x80\x9d a source close to Jennifer tells HollywoodLife EXCLUSIVELY. Good for her, right?\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo, her eyes aren\xe2\x80\x99t on anyone in particular. But, the ages of the guys she wants is someone in their early thirties for sure. She doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mind being a cougar if need be because its all about the fun,\xe2\x80\x9d our source continued. We\xe2\x80\x99re glad to hear Jen is not giving up on dating, especially since Justin wasn\xe2\x80\x99t her first marriage. If you recall, she married Brad Pitt, 54, in a private wedding ceremony in Malibu in 2000, but they split in 2005. And of course you know he went on to marry his Mr. and Mrs. Smith co-star Angelina Jolie. It\xe2\x80\x99s certainly hard to forget.\n\nNevertheless, we think Jen\xe2\x80\x99s idea to date younger guys might be a good idea! After all, it\xe2\x80\x99s worked just fine for Kourtney Kardashian, 38, who\xe2\x80\x99s dating 24-year-old model Younes Bendjima. They\xe2\x80\x99ve been dating for over a year.

"b'Suggesting that Jennifer Aniston can only be happy if she\'s with a man, married or in a relationship is not only a perfect example of everyday sexism, it is also shortsighted.\n\n""I just want Jen to be happy *bursts into tears*""\n\n""But she\'s Rachael!!

News of her divorce with (now-ex) husband Justin Theroux made headlines on 16 February, and it\'s all anyone can talk/opine about.\n\nAs is common with news of this nature (by which I mean one that dominates pop culture), what followed next were memes about Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston now being single (hey, have we forgotten Angie is single too?).\n\nBrad Pitt about to drive by Jennifer\'s house like...#JenniferAniston pic.twitter.com/TRNL9LQaq7 \xe2\x80\x94 Jackie (@Jackieannroth) February 15, 2018\n\ntell jennifer aniston i\xe2\x80\x99m single \xe2\x80\x94 aidan (@aidan) February 16, 2018\n\nJennifer Aniston: single \xe2\x9c\x94\xef\xb8\x8f\n\nBrad Pitt: single \xe2\x9c\x94\xef\xb8\x8f pic.twitter.com/glMAiNSQXz \xe2\x80\x94 coloradain\xc3\xbatil (@soyluluuu) February 16, 2018\n\nSomewhere, Jennifer Aniston is crafting her ""Hey, let\'s grab coffee and catch up"" text to Brad Pitt. https://t.co/pXLGo7O4Mp \xe2\x80\x94 Madeline Hill (@mad_hill) February 15, 2018\n\nIf Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston reunite.

But humour notwithstanding, there are several issues with our response to Aniston\'s breakup.\n\nFirst of all, it\'s a break up. Need I remind any of you what it feels like to end ties with someone who was your partner for over five years (married for 2, together for 7)? It feels like the pits. The last thing you want to do is scroll through twitter and find your face attached to way too many memes about getting back together with a man that left you for another woman. Pretty sure Jennifer, right now, is thinking ""thanks but no thanks"".\n\nWe are so obssessed with happy-endings and romance that practicality, self-happiness seem to matter very little.\n\nHas it occurred to noone that maybe, just maybe, Jennifer Aniston wants to be alone? That after a whirlwind of two marriages and much heartbreak, maybe it would better for her to be by herself? Would that be too bad? Why is it so hard for us to imagine Jennifer Aniston being alone? Or single? Does being single automatically mean someone is not happy?\n\nRemember, the statement that those two gave out with the news of their divorce was this: ""This decision was mutual and lovingly made at the end of last year. We are two best friends who have decided to part ways as a couple, but look forward to continuing our cherished friendship.""\n\nDoesn\'t sound any bit the heartbreak to me. If anything, Jennifer Aniston is probably happier being by herself and away from the world\'s baggage involving her love life. Besides, I\'d like to see people trying so hard to couple up the single male actors in Hollywood.\n\nSuggesting that Jennifer Aniston can only be happy if she\'s with a man, married or in a relationship is not only a perfect example of everyday sexism, it is also shortsighted.\n\nBesides, in my humble opinion, Aniston is way beyond Brad Pitt\'s league. If she *had* to get together with someone in the near future, I sincerely hope it is with someone new.\n\nLeo DiCaprio, single at 43: wow, LAD what a legend. Jennifer Aniston, single at 49: what\xe2\x80\x99s wrong with her? Why can\xe2\x80\x99t she find love?

"b'Kylie Jenner, unlike her sisters, tries to keep her relationships and home life private, especially when it comes to her relationship with boyfriend Travis Scott and their baby, Stormi Webster. Little Stormi was born on February 1, 2018, and her parents made one of their first event debuts together at the 2017 Met Gala. So, there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a long timeline of their relationship before they got pregnant with their first child. In an interview with Vogue Australia, Jenner said that because both she and Scott are experiencing parenthood for the first time, it\xe2\x80\x99s nice to learn together. Jenner explained, \xe2\x80\x9cWe both experienced this for the first time, so I love learning together and just watching him with her. He\xe2\x80\x99s so good with her and she\xe2\x80\x99s really obsessed with him.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWhile Jenner likes to keep her personal life private, she does feel it\xe2\x80\x99s important to address certain rumors. Over the course of her relationship with baby daddy Scott, there have been split rumors, reports that they rarely see each other, and even speculation that a bodyguard was Stormi\xe2\x80\x99s real father. So, Jenner has spoken out via Vogue Australia and has confirmed that there was no break up. Jenner also said that she and Scott live together. In her Vogue Australia interview, Jenner revealed, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m actually scrolling through Instagram right now, and it says that me and Travis don\xe2\x80\x99t live together, and so I just want to say that we never miss a night with each other, we go back and forth from my Calabasas house and the city home that we actually got together. So just if you wanted to add that in.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAfter Jenner\xe2\x80\x99s Vogue Australia article came out, she personally made it clear on social media that she and Scott have not split. A Twitter user named Lisa Marie, posted a tweet online that read, \xe2\x80\x9cYALL. Remember how my dad is a mover, and moves all the Kardashians/Jenners?????? Well home boy spilled the tea and told me that TRAVIS SCOTT AND KYLIE SPLIT. He said they moved all of Travis\xe2\x80\x99 shit out of her house.

"b'Universal\n\nAs noted in Variety, Chris Pratt will be receiving $10 million for his work in Universal/Comcast Corp.\'s Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, while Bryce Dallas Howard will be getting $8 million. As I wrote on Tuesday, it was a surprisingly solid example of relative parity. Yes, ten is more than eight, and both actors co-starred in the last Jurassic World movie, but this was a case of franchise-specific value versus proven star power and then coming out mostly even. I was pleasantly surprised and chalked it up as a win.\n\nThose considering it a moral outrage or an example of gender-based pay disparity are treating a victory as a defeat. That she got anywhere near Pratt\'s salary for the second Jurassic World movie counts as a sign that this conversation is having a positive effect. If we were basing salary on proven star power and ""butts-in-the-seats"" value, Pratt would be making a lot more than Howard regardless of whose story it was or who was the better actor. That it\'s even a close call is a relative victory for those wanting more money and better roles for actresses.\n\nIf you recall, Jurassic World was technically Claire\'s story. She is our introductory character and she is the one who has a (somewhat wobbly) character arc whereby she realizes that the animals that she merely treated as commodities were flesh-and-blood creatures and thus were capable of unpredictable and uncontrollable actions. Pratt\'s Owen was the co-star, with similar screentime and most of the action beats, but it wasn\'t necessarily his journey. That she came back at all for the sequel means the filmmakers realized that.\n\nI was actually relieved that Howard was asked to return considering the long history of big franchises (Mission: Impossible, The Hangover, Indiana Jones, the 1990s Batman sequels, etc.) treating their female leads like disposable items. This has gotten better in our current serialization era, but it\'s still an issue, especially for stand-alone pictures and comedies. That she and Pratt both returned meant the filmmakers were aware that while Pratt\'s post-LEGO Movie/Guardians of the Galaxy popularity was a big part of the film\'s initial success, it was not his movie.\n\nThere was little chance that Pratt and Howard were going to end up with the same relative paycheck for the second film. Chris Pratt is a proven box office draw not just in the MCU but (relatively speaking) the likes of Sony\'s Passengers (where he correctly got 60% of Jennifer Lawrence\'s $20 million payday) and The Magnificent Seven. Howard is a fine actress with terrific turns in The Village, The Help and Pete\'s Dragon among others, but Jurassic World was her first leading role in a major franchise. You\'ll remember that part of the prerelease campaign for Jurassic World was a comedic video where Howard sings about being mistaken for Jessica Chastain.\n\nYou could argue that it\'s an example of gender disparity that actors like Pratt get thrust from near-obscurity into a bunch of big franchise flicks and are then anointed movie stars when those films perform well (or rehabilitate their image as an indie darling if those tentpoles bomb). You\'d be 104% correct. That\'s a big factor in gender-based pay disparity. You command a bigger salary from well-received and successful star vehicles, which you can\'t accumulate if you\'re always playing the girlfriend/hostage to less famous male actors or the one woman in a sausage-fest.\n\nHence Michelle Williams being willing to reshoot Sony\'s All the Money in the World essentially for scale while Wahlberg (a major movie star with the ability to walk away to his next starring vehicle) held out for $1.5 million after Ridley Scott replaced Kevin Spacey with Christopher Plummer. For Wahlberg, it was just another studio job, a rare supporting role for a regular leading man, But for Williams, it was the opposite, a rare starring role in a major studio film for an actress used to headlining indies or playing the wife/love interest in studio pictures.\n\nAny number of white male actors are given the opportunity to build a healthy resume of acclaimed or financially successful starring vehicles and thus gain a reputation for solid leading man turns, even if most of those film are either indies or failed studio flicks. Even if Josh Brolin, Ryan Gosling or Tom Hardy can\'t open an envelope outside of IP-driven franchises, they are respected thespians and they get paid partially for the prestige and respectability that they bring to a project. It\'s why Gosling got $6.5 million for First Man and why Hardy got $7m for Venom.\n\nIt\'s harder for women to build up a resume that generates big paydays. With the near-death of the romantic comedy, legal thriller and adult drama, even many ""female-centric"" releases (The Force Awakens, Frozen, Jurassic World), contain one or two major female characters. Add a cultural disposition to view actresses as being inferior actors (How many strong performances is Blake Lively going to give before we count her as a decent actress?). Oh, and add the advantage for white male actors being able to prove and re-prove their worth in indie flicks or prestige TV (see: McConaughey, Matthew).\n\nI would argue that bringing back Bryce Dallas Howard for Fallen Kingdom was vital in establishing this fifth film as more than just ""random dino movie with the word Jurassic in the title."" Movie-to-movie continuity counts, which is why Shia LaBeouf made three Transformers movies. That, along with the optics at play, is part of why Howard, who hadn\'t headlined a major studio hit since The Village in 2004 (which was mostly sold - falsely - as a Joaquin Phoenix vehicle) before 2015, got $8 million while her more famous and more bankable co-star got $10m.\n\nThere are absurd cases where well-known actresses (or sportscasters) are paid less for relative equal work compared to their less-famous male co-stars (think Jennifer Lawrence making less than Jeremy Renner for American Hustle), just as I still find it outrageous how often we see a scenario where Amy Adams plays Garrett Hedland\'s girlfriend. And a major part of the problem is an industry where there are far more opportunities for Ashton Kutcher to prove that he\'s a reliable box office draw than Natalie Portman, thus financially justifying him getting three times what she made for No Strings Attached.\n\nBut, as frustrating as it must be, not every example of a woman being paid less for movie or TV work is an example gender-based discrimination. I was shocked, in a good way, that Bryce Dallas Howard A) made $8 million for Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom and B) made just 20% less than her much more ""box office draw"" co-star. It\'s a relative victory and a sign that the conversation is having a positive effect. Ms. Howard doesn\'t need you to make her out into a victim. You already forced her to ditch her snazzy high heels.'"
"b'After giving birth to True Thompson, is marriage next for Khloe Kardashian and Tristan Thompson? Actually, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve EXCLUSIVELY learned, there are reasons why she\xe2\x80\x99s in no rush to get hitched.\n\nEver since Khloe Kardashian, 34, and Tristan Thompson, 27, welcomed True into the world, fans have been eagerly waiting to see if a diamond ring would appear on her finger. Fans better keep waiting, because as a source close to Khloe EXCLUSIVELY tells HollywoodLife.com that she \xe2\x80\x9cis in no rush to get engaged to Tristan right now. Even though it is her dream to marry the father of her baby, she is also happy with the way things are.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue has given her so much satisfaction,\xe2\x80\x9d the source adds. \xe2\x80\x9c[Khloe] loves finally being a mom after her tough journey.\xe2\x80\x9d However, if Tristan were to get down on one knee, Khloe \xe2\x80\x9cwould not say no to a proposal, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not something she\xe2\x80\x99s pushing for anymore. She decided to stop putting pressure on things and just let it happen naturally. Now that she has True in her life, and Tristan has stepped up as an amazing father, Khloe feels like everything is going to be OK no matter what happens between them.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThere was a time when she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t feeling so optimistic about her relationship. Remember, while she was just days away from giving birth, Tristan got caught two-timing Khloe. That cheating may have sunk the chances of these two getting married any time soon. \xe2\x80\x9cKhloe was so ready to be engaged and married to Tristan,\xe2\x80\x9d a second insider EXCLUSIVELY tells HollywoodLife.com, \xe2\x80\x9cand then the cheating happened. That threw all her thoughts about the situation out the window. She is now much more guarded and wants to make 1000% sure that Tristan has changed for the better.\xe2\x80\x9d The second source says that Khloe wants proof that he will never cheat again before she accepts any proposals.\n\nTristan \xe2\x80\x9chad it all but now has to work for it if he wants to be married to her,\xe2\x80\x9d the source tells HollywoodLife.com. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is still proving himself to her and any engagement or marriage discussions is still a little more down the line to happen if at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIt seems that Khloe and Tristan\xe2\x80\x99s relationship is complicated AF\xe2\x80\xa6or is it? Some fans called Koko out when she got caught drinking from a green cup at Kylie Jenner\xe2\x80\x99s 21st birthday party. The color-coordinated drinking system had it that a green cup meant your relationship was \xe2\x80\x9ccomplicated,\xe2\x80\x9d but Khloe clarified things later. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not that deep,\xe2\x80\x9d she explained. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure I drank out of every colored cup that night.\xe2\x80\x9d'"
"b'So it seems that Katie Holmes and Jamie Foxx have finally decided to go public with their romance which the two have managed to keep under wraps for years now. The ongoing denials by each star certainly had the masses scratching their heads seeing as the duo were often seen in one another\xe2\x80\x99s company on getaways and at various locales in Los Angeles.\n\nReasons for Katie and Jamie not going public earlier are rumored to be due to a contract that was signed by Holmes during her swift divorce proceedings with her ex-husband Tom Cruise. The contract was said to have included a five-year dating clause which meant that the Dawson\xe2\x80\x99s Creek star was not allowed to date publicly for this duration. Well, that was back in 2012, so the five years are up, which leads onlookers to believe that the contract was a real binding agreement.\n\nAdditional claims, since Jamie and Katie were spotted walking in Malibu holding hands, have been made regarding Cruise\xe2\x80\x99s reaction to his ex and former co-star coming clean about their relationship. The action star is reportedly \xe2\x80\x9cfurious\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cenvious\xe2\x80\x9d about the relationship between Holmes and Foxx and feels a sense of betrayal over it all, as International Business Times states.\n\nA said source indicates that Tom is bothered by the romance and that \xe2\x80\x9cKatie is so happy with someone else,\xe2\x80\x9d adding that \xe2\x80\x9cTom would love to find his own true love, someone he can share the rest of his life with too. \xe2\x80\x9c\n\n\xe2\x80\x98Katie Holmes finally goes public with new man Jamie Foxx, I\xe2\x80\x99m questioning why she ever agreed to marry Tom Cruise\xe2\x80\x99https://t.co/NWx1Ogo3ml \xe2\x80\x94 The Sun (@TheSun) September 10, 2017\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s been no secret that Cruise\xe2\x80\x99s relationship with the Church of Scientology has caused both of his marriages to fail and if the star is to find love again, it must be with the approval of the faith. As for Tom being \xe2\x80\x9cfurious,\xe2\x80\x9d this seems a bit far-fetched seeing as the actor was snapped looking as happy as can be, even after news broke that Katie and Jamie are, in fact, an item.\n\nTom Cruise is pictured for the first time since ex-wife Katie Holmes confirmed her relationship with Jamie Foxx https://t.co/BqKD4cDrxm \xe2\x80\x94 Daily Mail Celebrity (@DailyMailCeleb) September 6, 2017\n\nAs The Sun indicated, Cruise recently landed in London and fans awaiting the Hollywood heartthrob were greeted with an ear-to-ear smile from Tom, who also gave an enthusiastic thumbs up. The actor had recently been injured while filming the latest installment for the Mission Impossible franchise, yet looked much better and entirely unaffected by the Katie Holmes and Jamie Foxx reveal.\n\n[Featured Image by Andrew H.

"b'Can you believe your favorite diva Gwen Stefani is 48 years old? Time really flies. Since she rose up to the limelight, she has been quite busy making her fans happy. Her journey to fame was a long and turbulent one, and so was her love life. After one unsuccessful marriage, the artist has been dating country music artist Blake Shelton since 2015. The happy couple met on The Voice US. Although they got engaged, there have been rumors that Gwen called off the wedding because of \xe2\x80\x98cheating rumors\xe2\x80\x99. But, is this even true?

He added that their divorce caused him \xe2\x80\x9ca lot of pain and sadness\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\nGavin said in an interview:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt really teaches you perspective on life. It\xe2\x80\x99s really health, happiness, and safety. After that, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what there is other than that.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAfter the divorce, Gwen found love once again.\n\nShe has been dating artist Blake Shelton since 2015.\n\nThey have been together for almost three years now. There was also a pregnancy rumor in 2017.\n\nAccording to Auntyacid, a source said:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey will get married one day but right now they are hyper-focused on getting pregnant. They believe there is still a chance for Gwen [to fall pregnant]. They are incredibly hopeful. Gwen and Blake started talking quickly about having a baby, but starting a family has not been easy for them. It\xe2\x80\x99s something that they really want and it\xe2\x80\x99s just not working out the way they wanted it to.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe source goes on:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBlake told Gwen he does want kids of his own and Gwen was willing to try.

They are so committed to one another.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe pair then got engaged.\n\nBut after months of planning and thinking about having the wedding in June, Gwen allegedly called the wedding off.\n\nThe rumors said that the mother-of-three called it off after worrying that Shelton had been unfaithful.\n\nAccording to a source, this confrontation caused a huge fight, and Gwen said there won\xe2\x80\x99t be a wedding.\n\nThe singer allegedly started feeling insecure and was bothered by the closeness of Blake and last year\xe2\x80\x99s The Voice winner Chloe Kohanski.\n\nChloe was on Blake\xe2\x80\x99s team, and Gwen saw more than a student-teacher relationship in them.\n\nA source went on to explain:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe started panicking about all the details \xe2\x80\x94 and about her future with Blake. Gwen and Blake had a massive fight and Gwen called off the wedding.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGwen feels as if she loves Blake more than Blake loves her right now. She told Blake all about her insecurities and how she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t handle another heartbreaking divorce because of trust issues she needs to face.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSources also claim that now they are trying to work things out.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMost friends believe they will still walk down the aisle someday, but Gwen and Blake have some things to work on first. Trust is important and this isn\xe2\x80\x99t the right time for a dream wedding. The last thing Gwen or Blake wants is another divorce.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHowever, according to the rumor-busting website, Gossip Cop, these rumors are false!\n\nThe website claims that Stefani and Shelton are not at war over Kohanski and that Stef\xe2\x80\x99s rep told them the wedding is not off.\n\nAccording to the rep, the couple\xe2\x80\x99s relationship is not \xe2\x80\x9con the rocks.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe site also adds that Chloe has a boyfriend.\n\nThe outlet also claims that Gwen isn\xe2\x80\x99t insecure at all.\n\nFans simply don\xe2\x80\x99t know who to believe right now, but one thing is for sure.

So whether it would be a cream rind, and a little bit green with pink, and our black bottles being the seeds.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a theme we used unintentionally through the quarter, and you probably wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t pick up on it, but it just acts as subtle way of talking about what season it is through the year,\xe2\x80\x9d Panton says.\n\n\n\n2. @k.els.e.y\xe2\x80\x99s Minimal & Neutral Instagram Theme\n\nFashion and beauty vlogger Kelsey Simone has achieved a ton of success on her YouTube channel, but the real success story is her Instagram account, which has over 650,000 followers to date.\n\nFor those looking to emulate Simone\xe2\x80\x99s minimalist Instagram theme, she has a few key pieces of advice.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne of the key elements to getting a minimal feed is having a lot of negative space pictures and fillers,\xe2\x80\x9d she says. \xe2\x80\x9cI also think it\xe2\x80\x99s really important to choose about three main colors, because if you have like 7 or 8 different colors in your feed it\xe2\x80\x99s not going have a cohesive color or tone.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nA post shared by Kelsey Simone (@k.els.e.y) on Sep 8, 2017 at 5:53pm PDT\n\n\n\nAnother tip from Simone is to categorize your photos. \xe2\x80\x9cI categorize it into selfies, outfit pictures, product shots, and fillers,\xe2\x80\x9d she says. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a rotation. For example, if I post a selfie, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to post a selfie right after that. So I\xe2\x80\x99ll post a selfie, I\xe2\x80\x99ll post a product shot, an outfit picture, a filler, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll keep that going.\n\n3. @elainery\xe2\x80\x99s Bright, Light, & Colorful Instagram Theme\n\nOne scroll through Elaine Rystead\xe2\x80\x99s Instagram feed and you\xe2\x80\x99ll immediately fall in love with her beautiful and varied shot selections. But the Vancouver-based photographer isn\xe2\x80\x99t just great with a camera, she\xe2\x80\x99s also a wiz when it comes to editing her photos.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI start with VSCO. It\xe2\x80\x99s my first step. I import the image and I decide what filter I want to use.\xe2\x80\x9d Rystead says. \xe2\x80\x9cA6, A7, M5, and M6 are my favorite filters because they\xe2\x80\x99re warm and they\xe2\x80\x99re bright, and they create a very similar tone for my feed.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I\xe2\x80\x99ll open up the image in SnapSeed. I\xe2\x80\x99ll go to the tools section, select \xe2\x80\x98Tune Image\xe2\x80\x99 and I\xe2\x80\x99ll play around with the features,\xe2\x80\x9d she says. \xe2\x80\x9cI love the ambience tool, especially if you want a little more detail. I\xe2\x80\x99ll also play with the brightness and contrast.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nA post shared by elaine rystead (@elainery) on May 29, 2017 at 9:28pm PDT\n\n\n\nFinally, when it comes to organizing the look of her feed before she posts, Rystead will open the Later app on her phone and plan her feed with Later\xe2\x80\x99s Visual Instagram Planner.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I have two dark images, I probably wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want them side by side,\xe2\x80\x9d she says. \xe2\x80\x9cI tend to put a dark image between two bright images, I find that that makes the other two bright images stand out.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPlan Your Instagram Feed\n\n4. @jeffmindell\xe2\x80\x99s Bright, Sunny, & Happy Instagram Theme\n\nIf you\xe2\x80\x99re ever in need of some inspiration for a colorful and uplifting Instagram theme, look no further than Jeff Mindell\xe2\x80\x99s feed. The Los Angeles-based lifestyle photographer has made a career of creating colorful content for brands of all types.\n\nSo how does he keep his own feed consistent? According to Mindell, he sticks to a few simple rules.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI generally use the same tones (it\xe2\x80\x99s no secret I love my blues and greens), I don\xe2\x80\x99t post photos taken at night, and I try to keep my photos taken from the same point-of-view, be it a shot of me or an interior space,\xe2\x80\x9d Mindell says.\n\nA post shared by Jeff Mindell (@jeffmindell) on Sep 11, 2017 at 1:41pm PDT\n\n\n\nMindell also admits to having a fairly \xe2\x80\x9cintense\xe2\x80\x9d editing process for his photos. \xe2\x80\x9cMy favorite apps that I use every day are SnapSeed, VSCO, Touch ReTouch, Facetune, SKRWT (I\xe2\x80\x99m a freak about having all my lines straight!), and of course A Color Story, where I have my own effects pack available for purchase within the app!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n5. @shopdoen\xe2\x80\x99s Vintage & Warm Instagram Theme\n\nThe team behind D\xc3\x94EN keeps a pretty amazing Instagram feed. Characterized by a laid-back and ultra-aesthetic bohemian vibe, it\xe2\x80\x99s no wonder how they\xe2\x80\x99ve racked up their nearly 75,000 followers!\n\nPart of D\xc3\x94EN\xe2\x80\x99s Instagram success can be explained by their beautiful Instagram theme. Despite showcasing hundreds of different outfits and styles on their account, they\xe2\x80\x99ve been able to maintain a consistent color palette centered around warm earthy tones.\n\nA post shared by D \xc3\x94 E N / @shopdoen (@shopdoen) on Sep 7, 2017 at 12:14pm PDT\n\nD\xc3\x94EN also edits their photos with a consistent filter, which gives their feed that 70s bohemian look. The overall result? Despite being product-based account, D\xc3\x94EN\xe2\x80\x99s Instagram feels more like a visual lifestyle blog.\n\n6. @everlane\xe2\x80\x99s Minimalist Instagram Theme\n\nEverlane is an apparel startup rooted in their motto of \xe2\x80\x9cradical transparency,\xe2\x80\x9d and they\xe2\x80\x99ve seen massive success on Instagram with a growing following of over 385,000 people. The reason for their success? A clean, simple, and visually appealing Instagram feed.\n\nJust check it out! It\xe2\x80\x99s packed with a ton of gorgeous photos that work so well with their brand. And each photo has a minimalist design, which is totally evocative of the clothes that Everlane creates.\n\nSo what can we learn from Everlane? Well, when you\xe2\x80\x99re developing your own Instagram style, it\xe2\x80\x99s super important to keep in mind how it will impact your brand, and, on the flip side, how it can be used to convey your beliefs and opinions.\n\nA post shared by Everlane (@everlane) on Aug 25, 2017 at 8:59am PDT\n\nTake Everlane\xe2\x80\x99s minimalist Instagram feed as an example. It\xe2\x80\x99s used to remind their followers that radical transparency is at the heart of the brand.\n\n7. @elizabethgilmore\xe2\x80\x99s Curious & Colorful Instagram Theme\n\nFor those seeking a lifestyle Instagram account that\xe2\x80\x99s as breathtaking as it is creative, look no further. Art director and graphic designer Elizabeth Gilmore certainly knows how to put a beautiful feed together.\n\nSo where does Gilmore find her inspiration?\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn today\xe2\x80\x99s times, it\xe2\x80\x99s important to have a unique perspective on how you see the world and ultimately how you share that view to your followers,\xe2\x80\x9d Gilmore says.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course, visual elements like color palette, composition, and themes are easy ways to have consistency in your account. But as I spend more and more time on the platform, I\xe2\x80\x99ve discovered it\xe2\x80\x99s more about being relentlessly you and sharing that story in my own way.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nYesterday a new camera joined the fam (used to shoot with Canon and Sony). I picked up the new FujifilmX-Pro2 in order to get myself off the iPhone and back to the basics. Here\xe2\x80\x99s my first Fuji #selfie \xf0\x9f\x93\xb8\xf0\x9f\x91\x8c Oh did I mention I like plants? \xf0\x9f\x8c\xb1\xf0\x9f\x8d\x83\xf0\x9f\x8c\xbf\xf0\x9f\x8d\x83\xf0\x9f\x8c\xb1#firsttimeFuji A post shared by Elizabeth Gilmore (@elizabethgilmore) on May 24, 2017 at 5:48pm PDT\n\nFor Gilmore, that story happens to be in saturated colors, hidden light patches, and curious encounters. \xe2\x80\x9cI really just share the small moments of my own life. The more I focus in on how I uniquely see beauty in this world, the stronger (and truer) the aesthetic is\xe2\x80\xa6 So lean into the things that you love and be as unapologetic as possible,\xe2\x80\x9d she says.\n\n8. @bethanymenzel\xe2\x80\x99s Bright, Beachy, & Relaxed Instagram Theme\n\nLifestyle blogger Bethany Menzel has attracted a huge following with her amazing content \xe2\x80\x94 but it\xe2\x80\x99s her beautifully curated Instagram feed, marked by the heavy use of pastels, lower saturations, and neutral tones, that really turns our heads.\n\nSo how does she keep such consistent Instagram theme? Well, according to Menzel, a lot of it has to do with being true to yourself.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaking sure that your aesthetic is a natural fit for your lifestyle helps a lot. Mostly everything I own is neutral colours, natural woods, or blush pink since a certain little girl rules my world,\xe2\x80\x9d she says. \xe2\x80\x9cSo it\xe2\x80\x99s natural that those colours are going to show up in my pictures. In my opinion your feed should be a representation of your life, that will likely result in everything feeling consistent and original.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLook how long this guy is! Passed along all of our baby stuff today because by the time we come home we\xe2\x80\x99ll have no use for it \xf0\x9f\x98\xb3 crazy. A post shared by Bethany Menzel (@bethanymenzel) on Aug 28, 2017 at 3:48pm PDT\n\nAnd like most other Instagram influencers, a lot of work goes into post-production. \xe2\x80\x9cI edit all photos in Photoshop Lightroom, whether the photos are taken on my iPhone, point & shoot, or DSLR, they all get imported into Lightroom where I apply a custom filter that a photographer helped me create and I\xe2\x80\x99ve slowly tweaked and refined over time.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThis is a big part of keeping your feed consistent. Using the same filter on every single photos is key to bringing cohesiveness to your feed. Want to learn more about building a consistent Instagram feed?

Need a good example? Check out Privacy Please\xe2\x80\x99s Instagram feed.\n\nIn some cases, a business may want to highlight one color. In other cases, it makes more sense to highlight several colors on your feed. Whatever direction you decide to take, it\xe2\x80\x99s important to be consistent! And that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what Privacy Please does best.\n\nDespite posting a range of different content types, including user-generated content, quotes, product shots, lifestyle content, and more, Privacy Please keeps a super-cohesive feed by sticking to a consistent color palette.\n\nLiterally perfect \xf0\x9f\x92\x95 A post shared by PRIVACY PLEASE (@privacypls) on Sep 11, 2017 at 4:52pm PDT\n\nYou can also achieve this look by editing your photos in a similar way, for example by adding the same filter to all of your photos.\n\n10. @laurenjaneyt\xe2\x80\x99s Rotating Instagram Themes\n\nSometimes it can be hard to commit to a single Instagram theme. With so many options out there, it\xe2\x80\x99s nice to switch things up every now and again. If you\xe2\x80\x99re looking for some advice on how to seamlessly rotate your Instagram theme, look no further than beauty, fashion, and lifestyle vlogger, Lauren Jane.\n\nLike Bethany Menzel, Jane recommends picking Instagram themes that make the most sense for you and your lifestyle.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you\xe2\x80\x99re choosing a theme, take into consideration what clothing you have, what color your room is, what color your bed spread is, what color your floors are, where you live.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou need to keep in mind what\xe2\x80\x99s achievable versus what you appreciate. For example, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any pink clothing. So when I wanted a pink theme, I wore the same pink sweatshirt in every photo, and that got rather boring. So that theme was not long-lived,\xe2\x80\x9d Jane says.\n\ncomment your favorite emoji for spam / a follow back on my second account @morelaurenjane \xf0\x9f\x8c\xb9\xf0\x9f\x94\xa5 A post shared by Lauren Mullally (@laurenjaneyt) on May 25, 2017 at 2:49pm PDT\n\nJane also recommends switching things up every so often. \xe2\x80\x9cEven though you want your theme to look cohesive and similar, you don\xe2\x80\x99t want every photo to be identical,\xe2\x80\x9d Jane says. \xe2\x80\x9cSo some easy ways to make sure you\xe2\x80\x99re spicing up your photos is to change up your poses and your angles.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n11. @teamwoodnote\xe2\x80\x99s Use of Borders in their Photos\n\nAdding borders to your Instagram posts can be a daunting prospect: once you commit to the look, it can be difficult to go back. But if you\xe2\x80\x99re ever in need of some inspiration for a beautiful Instagram feed that makes great use of borders, check out Caroline Ingraham Lee of Woodnote Photography!\n\nAccording to Caroline, a lot of work goes into prepping their photos for Instagram.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI use so many apps!\xe2\x80\x9d she says. \xe2\x80\x9cFirst, I size my images in VSCO because it\xe2\x80\x99s the only app I know of that has a crop to 4:5 option. Next, I edit it in A Color Story! After that, I pop the photo into Afterlight to add the white border at 15, which is something that other apps also don\xe2\x80\x99t allow me to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nA post shared by caroline ingraham lee. (@teamwoodnote) on Aug 14, 2017 at 12:55pm PDT\n\nCaroline also mentions the benefits of planning the look of her feed before publishing to Instagram. \xe2\x80\x9cI always upload my photos to Later to see them in my feed before I upload them,\xe2\x80\x9d she says. \xe2\x80\x9cIt helps me visualize how the photo is going to look before I actually post it, and then I can rearrange if there\xe2\x80\x99s too much of the same color, or not enough of something.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n12. @kimkardashian\xe2\x80\x99s New & Improved Instagram Theme\n\nSometimes even the most famous Instagrammers need help. Such was the case with Kim Kardashian who, in early August, took to Instagram to ask her followers for advice on her feed.\n\nI need more consistency on my insta feed. Should I go back to all one filter? Please help. I really need to step my insta page up A post shared by Kim Kardashian West (@kimkardashian) on Aug 2, 2017 at 9:40pm PDT\n\nWhile in the past Kim didn\xe2\x80\x99t stick to a specific aesthetic for her feed and posts, she did use a little bit of Instagram\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cAden\xe2\x80\x9d filter on top of every photo to add a warm and purplish hue.\n\nLately, however, Kim has focused on highlighting the warmth of her skin tone with a dark or cool background, and her colours centre around a cool palette of baby pinks, purples, and blues. Kim has learned that posting \xe2\x80\x9cfiller\xe2\x80\x9d photos is key to a good Instagram theme, and has been incorporating throwback images and detailed shots into her feed lately.\n\nShe also posts black and white photos on occasion, which helps create even more contrast between her colored and uncolored photos (and it allows her to post any photo, even if it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t go with her theme, because she can just make it black and white!)\n\n13. @katvondbeauty\xe2\x80\x99s Color Blocking Instagram Theme\n\nIncorporating color blocking into your Instagram feed can be difficult, but it isn\xe2\x80\x99t impossible. Take Kat Von D Beauty for example, a cosmetic brand that has totally mastered the technique.\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s no secret that cosmetic brands tend to do really well on Instagram. The visual appeal of their products (think colorful, eye-catching designs) are perfect for Instagram\xe2\x80\x99s ultra-engaged beauty community. But Kat Von D Beauty does something really special with their super colorful feed.\n\nRather than sticking to a color palette and posting the same colors consistently, the makeup brand uses color blocking to create an eye-catching aesthetic that really pops on their feed.\n\nA post shared by Kat Von D Beauty (@katvondbeauty) on Sep 20, 2017 at 3:02pm PDT\n\nWhat\xe2\x80\x99s really amazing is how often they switch between color blocks. While some brands will keep a color block going for weeks or even months, Kat Von D Beauty rarely goes more than a few days before switching to a new color.\n\n14. @peoplefootwear\xe2\x80\x99s Color Blocking Instagram Theme\n\nIf you\xe2\x80\x99re looking for a more tame (but still incredibly gorgeous!) example of color blocking in action, look no further than People Footwear.\n\nAccording to photographer Caley Vanular, People Footwear organizes their color blocking around monthly intervals and new product lines. \xe2\x80\x9cWe run a monthly colour theme based off new colours that come out each season,\xe2\x80\x9d says Vanular. \xe2\x80\x9cWe use our designers, VSCO, and the in-app filters to adjust the colour and size to better fit our theme.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe result? A seamless feed that incorporates product shots, lifestyle shots, and user-generated content.\n\nA post shared by People Footwear (@peoplefootwear) on Sep 8, 2017 at 12:55pm PDT\n\nPeople Footwear also spends a lot of time planning the look of their feed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe use scheduling apps to layout the images ahead of time to ensure a variety of colour, inspo, consumer content, video, GIFS, and product focusing on our colour theme and brand ethos,\xe2\x80\x9d says Vanular.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n15. @artifactuprising\xe2\x80\x99s Bright & Airy Instagram Theme\n\nArtifact Uprising, a Colorado-based lifestyle brand that specializes in custom photo books for photographers, runs a pretty amazing Instagram feed.\n\nWhen asked how they decide what content to post, marketing coordinator Megan White explains: \xe2\x80\x9cOur rule of thumb is to post anything that provokes awe and wonder.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMore than anything, though, we want to keep the images looking natural to be as real as possible,\xe2\x80\x9d she says.\n\nA post shared by Artifact Uprising (@artifactuprising) on Sep 10, 2017 at 5:25pm PDT\n\nFurthermore, according to White, beyond playing with exposure and making the colors in their photos pop, Artifact Uprising doesn\xe2\x80\x99t do much editing on their posts.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t put too much thought into making it orchestrated,\xe2\x80\x9d she says. \xe2\x80\x9cWe put up what makes sense and what we know our community will think is beautiful and inspiring. We do, though, use the Later layout tool to make sure it looks consistent.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go anywhere else to schedule and curate our social media!\xe2\x80\x9d she says.\n\n16. @taramilktea\xe2\x80\x99s Bold & Vibrant Instagram Theme\n\nCombining vibrant colors, drool worthy food, and breathtaking travel shots, it\xe2\x80\x99s no wonder why blogger Tara Milk Tea has accumulated over 800,000 followers on Instagram.\n\nAccording to a recent interview, Tara\xe2\x80\x99s Instagram theme took a number of years to develop. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I first started I was posting random stuff. I was trying to develop my photography skills in general. And then fashion became a hobby, and then after that came travel and food. And now I try to do as much of it as possible: fashion, food and travel all in one!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I look back to 2013 at the sort of things I was posting, I\xe2\x80\x99m like, \xe2\x80\x98what was I thinking!\xe2\x80\x99 but it sort of became a learning curve from there,\xe2\x80\x9d she says. Of course, today, Tara is much more consistent in what she posts \xe2\x80\x94 both in her subjects and style.\n\nA post shared by Tara Milk Tea (@taramilktea) on Sep 10, 2017 at 6:51am PDT\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy content does cater to my Asian fan base. I do really like cute Asian things and when I post about them, I think that attracts them,\xe2\x80\x9d she says. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I don\xe2\x80\x99t pay attention to just one audience, I try to be as diverse as possible\xe2\x80\xa6 like I try not to always do food, even though I love doing food, and it is my most popular content.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n17. @foodess\xe2\x80\x99 Mouth-Watering Instagram Theme\n\nJennifer Pallian, the writer, editor and food styler behind the popular blog Foodess, is a master when it comes to food styling and flat lays.\n\nSo how does Pallian achieve her beautiful Instagram theme? Well, it all starts before the photoshoot. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking about how I\xe2\x80\x99m going to style a flat lay, the first thing I think about is the flat lines and shapes \xe2\x80\x94 what it would look like if it was flat on paper,\xe2\x80\x9d says Pallian.\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s a jam for dinner kinda Monday, who\xe2\x80\x99s with me? Also, \xf0\x9f\x8d\xb7. Ok fine, \xf0\x9f\x8d\xb7\xf0\x9f\x8d\xb7. A post shared by Jennifer Pallian | Foodess.com (@foodess) on Aug 28, 2017 at 6:27pm PDT\n\nPallian also believes in the importance of keeping things as natural as possible. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen you\xe2\x80\x99re styling food, the most important thing is not to over-style. You\xe2\x80\x99re looking for that naturally unstyled kind of look,\xe2\x80\x9d she says. \xe2\x80\x9cYou want to look for those gooey bits and the crumbly crust and see how you can integrate that in a natural way.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd it you want to switch things up in your feed without stepping too far away from your Instagram theme, Pallian recommends incorporating cropping and white space. \xe2\x80\x9cWhite space is a really great tool to mix up your style and not having all your photos look the same,\xe2\x80\x9d she says.\n\n18. @ritual\xe2\x80\x99s Color-Focused Instagram Theme\n\nScroll through Ritual\xe2\x80\x98s beautifully-curated Instagram feed, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll soon see why the vitamin startup has taken off. They\xe2\x80\x99ve mastered the art of creating lifestyle content.\n\nFrom the very beginning, Ritual focused its Instagram strategy on creating an aesthetically pleasing feed, incorporating product shots, behind-the-scenes posts, inspirational imagery, and, of course, their signature yellow brand color.\n\nA post shared by Ritual (@ritual) on Aug 21, 2017 at 9:26am PDT\n\nBut a big part of their success on Instagram can be chalked up to their ability to incorporate UGC into their feed. In fact, according to founder and CEO Katerina Schneider, both the vitamin itself, which looks iridescent in the light, and its packaging were designed to be super-shareable.\n\n19. @tomwindeknecht\xe2\x80\x99s Pop Pastel Instagram Theme\n\nSticking to a consistent color palette is a great way to maintain a cohesive Instagram feed, and very few do it better than Tom Windeknecht, a California-based photographer and content creator.\n\nWhen asked what he likes to post on Instagram in a recent interview, Tom explains that nearly all of his work is edited with very colorful hues of pinks and blues.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI primarily look for lines, shadows, patterns, colors and shapes. I like clean, minimal compositions with bright colors,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cThese are the largest components of my work. I really try to force myself to look at things from a creative perspective, a smaller perspective, and not just the whole picture. For example, instead of seeing the whole building, I will try to look at corners, architectural details, or angles of the building.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nI\xe2\x80\x99m in the mood for love \xf0\x9f\x8e\xb6\xf0\x9f\x92\x96\xf0\x9f\x92\x99 #whpmood . #paintlifepink A post shared by Tom Windeknecht \xf0\x9f\x93\xb7 (@tomwindeknecht) on Jul 23, 2017 at 12:10pm PDT\n\nAnd when it comes to editing his photos, Tom has a fairly stringent process. \xe2\x80\x9cMy photo-editing routine usually consists of pulling the photo in Photoshop, tweaking the background colors, and then editing the hues. Sometimes, I will remove the background or sky completely, and replace it with a gradient.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n20. @jl_saez\xe2\x80\x99s Black & White Instagram Theme\n\nCreating a black and white Instagram theme for your account can be a daunting prospect, and it\xe2\x80\x99s definitely not for everyone. But when it\xe2\x80\x99s done well, it can look amazing. Take for example the Instagram account of Spanish photographer, Jose Luis.\n\nIn a recent interview, Luis offered a few pieces of advice to photographers. \xe2\x80\x9cSymmetry is always a good choice for square format photos, but spending time and effort in the selection of a scene is of central importance to ensure a good end result,\xe2\x80\x9d he says.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy advice is to choose a scene without any disturbing or distracting elements. Including objects that have nothing to do with the story you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to tell reduces the power of the picture, so keep it simple.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nA post shared by Jos\xc3\xa9 Luis (@jl_saez) on Jul 23, 2017 at 10:03am PDT\n\nHe also recommends shooting in color and then switching to black and white in post-production. \xe2\x80\x9cI usually shoot in color, even though I love the Noir filter in the iPhone\xe2\x80\x99s native camera app. I find that I can achieve a better black and white image in post-processing if I shoot the original photo in color,\xe2\x80\x9d he says.\n\nHopefully this list of 20 awesome Instagram themes gives you some inspiration to go and create your own Instagram theme!

"b'Kim Kardashian has been sent into a tail spin over her husband Kanye West\'s bizarre meltdown on a TMZ live stream - and is concerned about what it means for her reputation.\n\nKanye appeared in the TMZ offices on Tuesday and let slip a number of bizarre claims - including that he\'s addicted to drugs after getting plastic surgery.\n\nHe also sparked fury across the world by claiming being a slave was ""a choice"" and gushing over US president Donald Trump.\n\nIn the jaw-dropping rant, Kanye claimed: ""I was drugged the f**k out, bro, I was on opioids and I was addicted to opioids.\n\n""Two days after I got off opioids, I [screeching noise] I\'m in the hospital. I had plastic surgery, I got liposuction for y\'all, because I didn\'t want y\'all to call me fat, like y\'all called Rob [Kardashian] at the wedding, and made him fly home before me and Kim got married.""\n\nKanye then went into a spiel about how a friend had told him to stop popping the pills because ""they kill genius"", but doctors upped his dose from two tablets a day to seven while he was in hospital.\n\n""The reason why I dropped those tweets and everything, because I was drugged the f**k out, bro,"" he yelled while facing the TMZ newsroom.\n\n""These pills that they want me to take three of a day, I take one a week maybe, two a week.

He was missing just one ingredient: Kylie Jenner! The 20-year-old Keeping up with the Kardashians star was invited to join Travis in his hometown of Houston, but she decided to kick it with her family at home (where she would be far from the public eye.) This, needless to say, left Travis with a bad taste in his mouth. \xe2\x80\x9cTravis is super supportive of Kylie and obviously wants her to do whatever she needs to do to take the best care of herself but he does wish she\xe2\x80\x99d come out of hiding,\xe2\x80\x9d a source close to Travis EXCLUSIVELY tells HollywoodLife.com.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s hard for him because he wants them to do normal stuff together, instead of just hiding out at her house,\xe2\x80\x9d the source tells HollywoodLife.com. The insider brought up that Travis and Cactus Jack Records hosted a turkey drive for Hurricane Harvey relief in downtown Houston on Nov. 23. \xe2\x80\x9cHe was begging her to come out and do it with him, but she said no. She doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to be photographed at all right now. They had a bit of a fight over it. He\xe2\x80\x99s proud of her and wanted her there by his side.

Kylie is also reportedly \xe2\x80\x9chorrified\xe2\x80\x9d with how her body has changed with pregnancy, and the last thing she wants to do is leave the house.

"b""Even though the tabloids might have you believe otherwise, Jennifer Aniston has gone on to do incredible things in the decade or so since she divorced Brad Pitt. She\xe2\x80\x99s done a commendable share of philanthropic work (although she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t advertise it) for St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital, among other causes. She\xe2\x80\x99s reached impressive new heights as a dramatic actress, with a performance in last year\xe2\x80\x99s Cake so heartbreaking that many believed it deserved Oscar recognition. And she wrote a powerful essay this summer, trying to redirect the endless tabloid attention on her to more important issues in the world.\n\nNevertheless, when Pitt confirmed that he and Angelina Jolie were divorcing earlier this month, Aniston found herself swept back up into the magazine headline melee. Despite the suddenly aggressive tabloid and paparazzi attention since news of a celebrity breakup that has nothing to do with her, it seems as though Aniston has gone about her business as usual\xe2\x80\x94joining husband Justin Theroux in New York this week for the premiere of his latest film, The Girl on the Train. And while there, Theroux was tossed a question about the Brangelina breakup and Aniston\xe2\x80\x99s new involvement in the headlines. Rather than refuse to answer the question, as is certainly his red-carpet right, the Leftovers actor took the decidedly classy route in responding.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs a child of divorce all I can say is that\xe2\x80\x99s terrible news for those children and that's all you can really say,\xe2\x80\x9d Theroux told the Business Insider, referring to Pitt and Jolie\xe2\x80\x99s six children. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s boring to sort of comment on anything else. People are having a bad time, that's horrible.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTheroux also commented on the fact that Aniston has been dragged back into Pitt-Jolie headlines of late, calling the new tabloid narratives \xe2\x80\x9cnonsense.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s an endless appetite for trash, apparently, though everyone would say that they don\xe2\x80\x99t have that appetite,\xe2\x80\x9d Theroux continued. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I think a lot of people do because people buy it. But there are bigger things to bitch about.

"b'CLICK HERE if you are having a problem viewing the photos on a mobile device\n\nBrad Pitt\xe2\x80\x99s image as the architectural savior of New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina\xe2\x80\x99s destruction is being questioned in a new report that alleges that a number of homes built by his nonprofit in the Lower Ninth Ward are falling apart.\n\nThe report by the Daily Mail also suggests that the actor, in the wake of his nasty breakup from Angelina Jolie, has lost his passion for fulfilling his original commitment to build 150 affordable, durable and environmentally efficient homes.\n\nThe Daily Mail recently visited New Orleans\xe2\x80\x99 Lower Ninth Ward, where many homes belonging to black and low-income families were swept away after levees of the city\xe2\x80\x99s industrial canal were breached during the hurricane 13 years ago.\n\nPost-Katrina, the humanitarian-minded Pitt and Jolie swooped in to the city and bought their own elegant French Quarter mansion, while Pitt set up the nonprofit Make it Right to help regenerate the Lower Ninth Ward.\n\nArchitectural enthusiast Pitt, 54, promised the nonprofit would build 150 new homes using cutting-edge design that would emphasize safety and adherence to LEED platinum building standards.\n\nMake it Right spent at a minimum of $25 million to build brightly painted, architecturally distinct homes that were sold to Lower Ninth Ward residents at a discount, though residents told the Daily Mail they cost around $150,000 each \xe2\x80\x94 or market value.\n\nNow, residents are telling the Daily Mail that some of the homes didn\xe2\x80\x99t live up to the promise offered by Pitt or by his nonprofit, saying that the homes contain structural flaws and are now falling apart.\n\nDaily Mail published photos showing some of those homes, with roofs caving in, wood rotting and walls collapsing or falling away from the house. Some residents used their life savings, combined with federal relief funding, to buy the homes. But some found they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t keep up with the repairs and have abandoned them, the Daily Mail added.\n\nResident Constance Fowler told the Daily Mail that her next-door neighbors in a Make it Right home had to move out because the wife was getting sick from the mold. Make it Right promised to renovate the house, but workers found its roof was beyond repair, Fowler said. The house was left unoccupied and rotting away. Fowler told the Daily Mail she had to repeatedly petition Make it Right and the city to tear it down.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMake It Right says this is the largest green community in the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d Fowler said to the Daily Mail. \xe2\x80\x9cLook how many are boarded up now or abandoned.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeople have problems with porches, roofs, walls falling apart,\xe2\x80\x9d she added. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s six out of seven homes right next to me that have had significant repairs.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnother resident, Doris Wyman, said she and her husband Henry are only able to stay in their Make it Right home because Henry is a skilled handyman.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m concerned about neighbors\xe2\x80\x99 homes,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cJust because mine is holding up, I know others are falling apart, their walls, roofs and porches.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWyman said Make it Right may have brought people back to the Lower Ninth Ward, but ultimately failed in its mission if people can\xe2\x80\x99t stay in their homes. She acknowledged that the intention probably was \xe2\x80\x9cbeautiful\xe2\x80\x9d but asked, \xe2\x80\x9cWhere did they go wrong?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPitt used to be a regular presence in the neighborhood and at the Make it Right headquarters, the Daily Mail said. But residents told the Daily Mail they haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen him for a couple of years.\n\nThe New Orleans Times-Picayune reported in May 2015 that Pitt and Jolie, then Hollywood\xe2\x80\x99s premier globe-trotting super couple, were selling their New York Orleans mansion for $6.5 million.\n\nA representative for the couple insisted at the time that the sale didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that the couple were wavering in their commitment to the Lower Ninth Ward.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes they are letting go of this property and will look for something more off the beaten path down the road,\xe2\x80\x9d the rep said told the Times-Picayune. \xe2\x80\x9cIn the meantime, they remain committed to, and infatuated as ever with the city of New Orleans, and will continue to focus on growth in the Lower Ninth through the Make It Right Foundation.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nJolie filed for divorce from Pitt in September 2016, and the couple have since been locked in a bitter, high-profile battle over their divorce and custody of their six children, ages 10 to 16. Pitt also was initially hit with allegations that he was drinking too much and had become violent with their oldest son, Maddox, 16, during a flight from Europe in 2016.\n\nPitt, facing the biggest scandal of his three-decade career, \xe2\x80\x9cturned inward,\xe2\x80\x9d E! News recently reported. In a candid 2017 interview with GQ Style, Pitt used an architectural metaphor to describe his recovery from the breakup of his family, saying he relied on therapy, a newfound sobriety and plenty of solitude to strip down \xe2\x80\x9cto the foundation and break out the mortar.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWith regard to his focus on Make it Right, a source close to Pitt insisted to the Daily Mail that the actor has visited New Orleans several times over the past few years and continues to make the organization a priority.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn addition to personally being there, he continues to dedicate significant time and financial support to this project,\xe2\x80\x9d the source said. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is an ongoing project for both Make It Right and for Brad \xe2\x80\x94 who has personally donated his time and millions of his own dollars to ensure the community is revitalized and the project continues as scheduled.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIn a phone interview from Los Angeles with the New Orleans Times-Picayune in 2015 \xe2\x80\x94 the 10th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina \xe2\x80\x94 Pitt said he had recently visited the Lower Ninth Ward. He delighted in how the neighborhood had become an \xe2\x80\x9coasis of color and the solar panels.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPitt told the Times-Picayune he also had talked to residents sitting on their front porch. He asked them how their new homes were working out.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood,\xe2\x80\x9d he said they told him. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I say what\xe2\x80\x99s your utility bill? And they\xe2\x80\x99ll throw something out like, \xe2\x80\x9924 bucks\xe2\x80\x99 or something, and I feel fantastic.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAt the same time, Pitt admitted to the Times-Picayune that he and the organization had been \xe2\x80\x9cincredibly naive\xe2\x80\x9d in understanding what it really takes to rebuild a community.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe went into it incredibly naive,\xe2\x80\x9d he told the newspaper, \xe2\x80\x9cjust thinking we can build homes \xe2\x80\x94 how hard is that? \xe2\x80\x94 and not understanding forgivable loan structures and family financial counseling and getting the rights to lots and HUD grants and so on and so forth.

His chin jutted out the door and then he just changed completely into a leering reptilian.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAccording to one passenger, Jay-Z\xe2\x80\x99s reptilian form is a shrunken version of his human form. Describing reptilian Jay-Z on Twitter, the passenger wrote, \xe2\x80\x9cHe looked sickly, about five feet tall, like a hunchback crossed with a bird, but with scales and a really negative vibe.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnother witness described him as \xe2\x80\x9cswaggering around, evil, grey, a f*cking reptile.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTwitter exploded with tweets detailing the scene as soon as the plane landed in Los Angeles and passengers were able to access wifi. Within minutes, before passengers had even disembarked, the hashtag #ReptilianJayZ had been retweeted thousands of times.\n\nHowever as the trending topic began attracting attention on Twitter the tweets with the #ReptilianJayZ hashtag and the accounts behind them began to disappear.\n\nThe hashtag disappeared from Twitter\xe2\x80\x99s top 10 trending topics and now appears to have been airbrushed from history by the social media platform.\n\nA public figure who wishes to remain anonymous for fear of losing her Twitter profile \xe2\x80\x93 a verified account with over 1,400,000 followers \xe2\x80\x93 says that she clicked on the hashtag and watched in real time as hundreds of tweets and user accounts were deleted.\n\nShe saved copies of as many new tweets as she could before they were also deleted.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cJay-Z tweets were only staying published for 20 or 30 seconds before they were being scrubbed. It was eerie to watch people being silenced before my very eyes.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTwitter explained they were deleting the tweets as they fell foul of the platform\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x99Hateful conduct\xe2\x80\x99 rules:\n\nHateful conduct: You may not promote violence against or directly attack or threaten other people on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability, or disease.\n\nIn a series of since deleted tweets, one eyewitness, taking advantage of Twitter\xe2\x80\x99s new 280 character limit, said she approached Jay-Z when he was in human form and asked him \xe2\x80\x9cwhat the actual f*ck?\n\nJay-Z stared at her frozen face, and then laughed a horrible laugh, before unleashing some kind of \xe2\x80\x9creptilian manifesto\xe2\x80\x9d on the unsuspecting business class passenger:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet ready, the Statue of Liberty will be shapeshifting soon, Jesus Christ in Rio will manifest as reptilian. Mount Rushmore will be taken over for the glory of our superior race. You will see the world as it really is \xe2\x80\x93 JAY Z\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nUnited Airlines, desperate to avoid a new scandal, sent two men with guns and a blanket onboard to shepherd Jay-Z off the flight before any of the other passengers were allowed to leave, according to multiple witnesses.\n\nThere were audible gasps of relief as Jay-Z left the aircraft.\n\nExperts claim Jay-Z belongs to the Babylonian Brotherhood \xe2\x80\x93 a group of shapeshifting reptilian humanoids determined to control humanity and usher in the New World Order.\n\nAccording to historians there have been sightings of reptilians around the world at regular intervals throughout history, but it is widely believed that we are now in a golden age of reptilian sightings. There is a belief that the world is gaining consciousness, waking up, and that the veil is slowly lifting.\n\nIt is said that Jay-Z, a member of the dominant reptilian-Illuminati bloodline, is becoming one of the most commonly sighted shapeshifting reptilians in the world, second only to Queen Elizabeth.\n\nHowever experts warn that two people watching the same scene will not necessarily both be able to discern the shapeshifting reptilian, however more people than ever before have developed the ability to witness reptilians manifest in their true form.\n\nDo YOU want to write for HMB?

"b'Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan officially announced their split on Monday night after months of speculation that the couple was heading for a divorce. Fans were stunned to hear the news that the pair had decided to end their nine-year marriage and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help but wonder what caused the sad breakup.\n\nAccording to an April 3 report by Radar Online, there were many factors that led to the end of Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan\xe2\x80\x99s marriage. The first is likely the fact that Tatum wanted to have more children. The actor and his estranged wife are the parents of one daughter, Everly, but it seems that the Magic Mike star wanted a bigger family, which is something that Dewan didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to be on board with. A past report by OK! Magazine claims that Jenna wanted to get back into acting and that caring for a newborn would derail those plans.\n\nThe baby battle allegedly continued for Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan when the actress got tired of being a housewife while her husband spent his time on movie sets. A source revealed that Tatum made more than enough money to support the family and that he wanted Dewan at home with little Everly so she would not be raised by nannies.\n\nThe jealousy allegedly began to rise in Jenna Dewan as Channing Tatum hit new levels of success with movies like 21 Jump Street, Magic Mike, and their sequels. The pair met on the set of the film Step Up as equals in their careers, but Channing\xe2\x80\x99s celebrity surpassed Jenna\xe2\x80\x99s over the years. However, that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t all Jenna was reportedly jealous of.\n\nChanning Tatum has become a sex symbol in Hollywood, and women flock to him wherever he goes. The actor will often create a gaggle of girls and women around him, and sources claim that Jenna Dewan hated the way her husband flirted with fans in front of her. Although many fans deemed the pair as the perfect couple, Dewan told the media earlier this year that they are far from perfect and \xe2\x80\x9cfight\xe2\x80\x9d just like any other couple would.\n\nChanning Tatum and Jenna Dewan released an official statement on their split via social media and revealed they would make no further comments on the end of their marriage going forward.'"

Katy, back in 2014, warned fans to \xe2\x80\x9cwatch out for the Regina George in sheep\xe2\x80\x99s clothing.\xe2\x80\x9d Plus, another Internet Nancy Drew said that the song sounds similar to Peaches\xe2\x80\x99s song \xe2\x80\x9cOperate,\xe2\x80\x9d which was featured in the movie.\n\nSurely, this means something, right? Well, it may be pure coincidence, as a source tells TMZ that Taylor\xe2\x80\x99s album lyrics have \xe2\x80\x9cnothing to do with Mean Girls, Regina George or Katy.\xe2\x80\x9d Interesting. With the video for \xe2\x80\x9cLWYMMD\xe2\x80\x9d dropping during the 2017 MTV Video Music Awards \xe2\x80\x93 an event that Katy is hosting, by the way \xe2\x80\x93 fans will see if Taylor has truly decided to give Katy a \xe2\x80\x9cpass\xe2\x80\x9d on her new album. If that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t enough, sources tell TMZ that \xe2\x80\x9csomething big\xe2\x80\x9d will happen at the VMAs between Katy and Taylor, and that it \xe2\x80\x9cwould not be surprising\xe2\x80\x9d if the two appeared on stage together to \xe2\x80\x9cpublicly bury the hatchet.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWatch out for the Regina George in sheep's clothing\xe2\x80\xa6 \xe2\x80\x94 KATY PERRY (@katyperry) September 9, 2014\n\nWhile Taylor\xe2\x80\x99s reportedly not going after Katy, the \xe2\x80\x9cBlank Space\xe2\x80\x9d singer is not squashing all her beefs. While \xe2\x80\x9cLook What You Made Me Do\xe2\x80\x9d may not be Taylor\xe2\x80\x99s response to Katy\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cSwish, Swish,\xe2\x80\x9d many fans have taken it as a shot at Kanye West, 40, and Kim Kardashian, 36. After all, it was Taylor\xe2\x80\x99s drama over Kanye\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cFamous\xe2\x80\x9d that had fans rebranding her as \xe2\x80\x9cQueen of the Snakes,\xe2\x80\x9d and many have interpreted the lyrics of the song to be a Kanye-diss. However, Kim isn\xe2\x80\x99t really sweating Taylor, as a source close to Kimye EXCLUSIVELY tells HollywoodLiife.com that Taylor\xe2\x80\x99s track isn\xe2\x80\x99t really bothering Kim. On the other hand, \xe2\x80\x9cKanye is clearly pissed over the song,\xe2\x80\x9d the source said. Uh-oh. One feud may have ended, but another is still going strong.\n\nDo you want to see Taylor and Katy call off their feud, HollywoodLifers? Do you think it\xe2\x80\x99s time?"""
"b""Two decades strong! James Brolin and Barbra Streisand are nearing their 20th wedding anniversary this year.\n\nET\xe2\x80\x99s Katie Krause spoke with Brolin at the Hallmark Channel and Hallmark Movies & Mysteries winter Television Critics Association red carpet on Saturday, where he revealed that despite his decades-long romance, he still doesn't have all the answers.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know, because nobody trains you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said of the secret to his and Streisand's marriage. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is my third time -- third marriage. I picked difficult situations the first two times, but I think you learn with each one. I\xe2\x80\x99m a person that believes that if I\xe2\x80\x99m wrong, that\xe2\x80\x99s when I learn, and when I\xe2\x80\x99m right, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t learned a thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNoting that he takes his relationship \xe2\x80\x9cday to day,\xe2\x80\x9d Brolin revealed that he\xe2\x80\x99s an advocate of marriage counseling.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do believe in counseling if anybody ever has a problem in their marriage. Bring in a referee, talk it over, and I swear to you, it will dispel by the end of the session, each time!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cSometimes in a tough marriage, it\xe2\x80\x99s tough to talk, but if you do, it works!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe 77-year-old actor has also learned to maintain his marriage with Streisand by not interrupting her during hectic times.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen she\xe2\x80\x99s busy, she\xe2\x80\x99s really focused, and part of our good relationship is that I understand that,\xe2\x80\x9d he shared. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd if I come to her with something important and she says, \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t have time right now,\xe2\x80\x99 she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have time, period. That\xe2\x80\x99s the way the mind works. You gotta focus.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAs for how Streisand, 75, makes him feel special, Brolin said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m always welcome when I get home. I always get notes, \xe2\x80\x98Hurry home!\xe2\x80\x99 When I get there, there\xe2\x80\x99s always something kind of great waiting for me, some plan, and I try to reciprocate.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\nBarbra Streisand Calls Out Golden Globes for Not Awarding More Female Directors\n\n\xe2\x80\x98Girls Trip' Star Tiffany Haddish Says She Taught Barbra Streisand All About Cardi B\n\nJosh Brolin on His Ripped Bod and How He Knew Wife Kathyrn Boyd Was the One (Exclusive)\n\nEXCLUSIVE!

HollywoodLife.com has EXCLUSIVE details inside how she kept it a secret from her family and stayed reclusive in her healing process.\n\nShe did it! Caitlyn Jenner made the final step towards becoming a woman by undergoing gender reassignment surgery and she did it with super secrecy.\xe2\x80\x9cCaitlyn was very private and reclusive after her reassignment surgery. It was something that she had been thinking about for a long time and she wanted her body to heal after the surgery given the risks of complications,\xe2\x80\x9d a source tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY.\n\nThe 67-year-old even kept the news of the procedure from her own family members! \xe2\x80\x9cFor her it was the final stage to becoming a woman and she did not really discuss it with her immediate family. Caitlyn had fully talked about the procedure with her doctors and her other transgender friends, so, she fully knew what was involved and was totally prepared,\xe2\x80\x9d our insider adds.\n\nThe former reality star reveals in her upcoming memoir that, \xe2\x80\x9cYou want to know, so now you know. Which is why this is the first time, and the last time, I will ever speak of it.\xe2\x80\x9d While she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t go into in-depth detail, the former Olympian says that having a penis had \xe2\x80\x9cno special gifts or use for me\xe2\x80\xa6I just want to have all the right parts.

The stunning star revealed her new identity as \xe2\x80\x9cCaitlyn\xe2\x80\x9d in June 2015, appearing on the cover of Vanity Fair in a white corset. Then, in Oct. 2016, she legally changed her name to \xe2\x80\x9cCaitlyn Marie,\xe2\x80\x9d as well as her gender to female.

"b'At the close of 2016, plenty was up in the air, from the future of the country to what rapper Drake and multi-hyphenate Jennifer Lopez meant by posting his-and-her selfies on Instagram. Did the photos of them cuddling signify that they were dating, or were they just collaborating on new music? How much could one read into reports that they spent New Year\xe2\x80\x99s together, and he was buying her at least one of the rocks that she got? And how did this all end so that she could embark on a new relationship with fellow New York City treasure Alex Rodriguez?\n\nNow, there are some answers: Drake dropped his album More Life on Saturday night, and E.W. reports that Lopez is all over it, but not on it exactly. \xe2\x80\x9cGet It Together,\xe2\x80\x9d which first \xe2\x80\x9cleaked\xe2\x80\x9d to the public when TMZ published videos of J.Lo and Drake at a prom-themed party, dancing to the song, sounded as though it featured Lopez\xe2\x80\x99s vocals. British singer Jorja Smith is the one singing on the final version, though.\n\nMore pointedly still, \xe2\x80\x9cTeenage Fever\xe2\x80\x9d samples the entire hook from \xe2\x80\x9cIf You Had My Love,\xe2\x80\x9d Lopez\xe2\x80\x99s 1999 hit from her first album, On the 6, but slows it down so it\xe2\x80\x99s more somber. Is that a dig? Or is that the collaboration part that they were hinting at all along?\n\nThe most pointed reference to Jenny from the Block arrived on the opening track \xe2\x80\x9cFree Smoke,\xe2\x80\x9d in which he raps, \xe2\x80\x9cMiraval to the face\xe2\x80\x9d (i.e., Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie\xe2\x80\x99s shared wine label that specializes in ros\xc3\xa9), followed by, \xe2\x80\x9cI drunk text J. Lo / Old number so it bounce back.\xe2\x80\x9d How perfectly Drake that he learns he\xe2\x80\x99s been rejected by Lopez via a passive number change while tipsy on ros\xc3\xa9. Almost too Drake, really.\n\nThis was the problem all along. The stories circling these two were on the nose, a little too convenient for drumming up album excitement. Their matching intimate Instagrams arrived too suddenly with not enough confirmed clarity from either camp.\n\nDrake\xe2\x80\x99s feelings could be genuinely hurt, leading to him cutting Lopez out of the album. He also could have pivoted to fit the public narrative when nobody bought that they were together. Or the amount of J.Lo on the album now could have been the plan all along. We don\xe2\x80\x99t know. But what we do know is that Lopez officially denied the relationship almost two weeks before More Life landed. During her Shades of Blue media blitz in early March, she told The Daily Show\xe2\x80\x99s Trevor Noah, \xe2\x80\x9cLet me clear this up. I am not with Drake. Maybe that\xe2\x80\x99s all I need to say.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe next day was the Instagram double-tap heard round the world, and Page Six confirmed that Alex Rodriguez and Lopez were dating.\n\nThe tone of this relationship is more fitting and authentic. Lopez is neither hiding their time spent together\xe2\x80\x94they\xe2\x80\x99ve been seen out at dinner around Miami and in the Bahamas\xe2\x80\x94nor is she promoting the new coupling on her own feeds.\n\nOn Saturday, right before More Life dropped, she arrived at the Yankee training camp in Florida to reportedly watch the retired Bronx bomber from a private box. By now, it\xe2\x80\x99s very much, \xe2\x80\x9cDrake who?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nVanity Fair has reached out to Lopez for comment on the album.'"

"b'NBC\xe2\x80\x99s hit singing competition series The Voice has been star-studded from the beginning, with mega-celebrities like Blake Shelton, Adam Levine, Alicia Keys, and Kelly Clarkson finding talent from their spinning chairs. But how much have the coaches past and present gotten paid to mentor the up-and-comers? Prepare to be blown away by how much money they make, because it\xe2\x80\x99s a lot!\n\nKelly Clarkson\xe2\x80\x99s The Voice Salary\n\nRadar reported that Kelly is being paid about $14 million per season deal. Why so much? Well, the new American Idol will begin airing the same year, and there was allegedly a bidding war for which show would get her on the cast. The Voice won out, so producers offered her the second-largest salary ever for it!\n\nBlake Shelton\xe2\x80\x99s The Voice Salary\n\nBlake is also one of the highest-paid coaches on the show, and we totally get why. He\xe2\x80\x99s a fan-favorite, he\xe2\x80\x99s been there since the beginning, and his team has won five times! The Wrap reported that Blake made about $13 million per season as of 2016, but insiders told Radar that that number is even higher now because he and girlfriend Gwen Stefani negotiated together to get huge bonuses. We\xe2\x80\x99d be lying if we said watching their romance unfold on the show isn\xe2\x80\x99t a huge draw when they appear together!\n\nAdam Levine\xe2\x80\x99s The Voice Salary\n\nAdam was apparently being paid the same as Blake before the Gwen stuff came about according to The Wrap, so he is likely still around $13 million per season (which is $26 million per year!). He\xe2\x80\x99s also been a coach since Season 1, and has won 3 seasons. The difference in pay might be at the core of their recent rift that Life & Style recently learned about. Unfortunately the duo isn\xe2\x80\x99t as close as they once were, and their friendship now seems \xe2\x80\x9cforced\xe2\x80\x9d off-air.

Though this is considered normal for new coaches, it was $5 million less than Miley, who started on the same season.\n\nMiley Cyrus\xe2\x80\x99 The Voice Salary\n\nMiley only appeared on two seasons of The Voice, but she made as much as longtime coaches Blake and Adam, raking in about $13 million per season according to Money Nation. That\xe2\x80\x99s probably because she\xe2\x80\x99s a huge star and really helped bring in more of the younger demographic.\n\nJennifer Hudson\xe2\x80\x99s The Voice Salary\n\nIt is unclear how much Jennifer Hudson made as a coach, but it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t sound like she will be a part of the show past Season 13. A source told Life & Style exclusively that Jennifer can\xe2\x80\x99t take a joke, and didn\xe2\x80\x99t get along with the other coaches. Plus, Kelly Clarkson joined for Season 14, and they probably don\xe2\x80\x99t need more than one American Idol winner on the crew.\n\nGwen Stefani\xe2\x80\x99s The Voice Salary\n\nGwen has had a few stints on the hit NBC show, and while she\xe2\x80\x99s always been beloved, her popularity has only grown since her relationship with Blake began. She started out making $10 million per season on Season 7, but by Season 12 she was reportedly making more than $13 million thanks to bonuses surrounding her relationship with Blake. Unfortunately, Radar reports that her time on the show is likely over for good. \xe2\x80\x9cGwen would not be on with Miley at the same time\xe2\x80\xa6 she has not made plans to return to the show\xe2\x80\xa6 she feels her time on the show has ran its course.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPharrell Williams\xe2\x80\x99 The Voice Salary\n\nPharrell Williams was a coach on The Voice from 2014 to 2016, and though he\xe2\x80\x99s a Grammy-winner, he reportedly raked in a lot less than other coaches. Feel Guide reports that he was making about $8 million per season, though it\xe2\x80\x99s unclear if he just negotiated badly or didn\xe2\x80\x99t care that much about the money.\n\nChristina Aguilera\xe2\x80\x99s The Voice Salary\n\nChristina Aguilera was actually the highest-paid Voice coach ever, having worked on six seasons of the show. The Wrap reports that she began making $17 million, but took a pay cut in later seasons, making $12.5 million (less than Miley, Blake, and Adam).\n\nShakira\xe2\x80\x99s The Voice Salary\n\nShakira did pretty well for herself on Seasons 4 and 6 of The Voice. The Hollywood Reporter claims that she inked a deal making $12 million per season when she replaced Christina.\n\nCee Lo Green\xe2\x80\x99s The Voice Salary\n\nCee Lo Green got totally jipped during his time on The Voice. He was the lowest-paid coach ever, making $2 million per season when he first started, and getting bumped to $6.5 million before he departed in Season 6, according to Cheat Sheet.\n\nUsher\xe2\x80\x99s The Voice Salary\n\nUsher was Cee Lo\xe2\x80\x99s replacement after Season 6, and though he did get paid more than the producer, he was still one of the lower-paid coaches on the show.

"b'Jim Carrey has responded to a new report that says he and the late Robin Williams were engaged in a ""bitter feud."" The original report seems to stem from a new biography about Williams that was written by New York Times journalist Dave Itzkoff. In Itzkoff\'s book, it\'s touched on that the late comedian felt threatened by Carrey\'s success in the 1990s. To make matters worse, Robin Williams was reportedly upset that Jim Carrey took over on the role of the Riddler in 1995\'s Batman Forever after he turned the role down.\n\nThe report in question comes from Radar Online, which isn\'t always 100 percent accurate in all of its reporting. Jim Carrey has made a statement calling the entire report fabricated and made up after a tiny blurb was mentioned in Dave Itzkoff\'s biography. Carrey acknowledges that there might have been some insecurity on the part of Williams, but there was absolutely no feud. Carrey explains.\n\n""RadarOnline is completely off base and creating a feud that didn\'t exist. Robin may have expressed insecurity about me and my rise to success but I have never had anything but the greatest respect for him and his genius. He was also always respectful to me in person. He called me Maestro and I called him Billy the Kid. Let\'s get it straight. There\'s no feud if one side isn\'t aware of it.""\n\nIn addition to his statement on the so-called feud with Robin Williams, Jim Carrey took a break from painting the Trump administration and shared a new painting that he did of the late comedian on social media. The painting is done in Carrey\'s unique style and features Robin Williams with a radiating golden glow around him. Carrey continued to heap praise on Williams in the caption of the photo. He says.\n\n""Robin Williams\' mind was a quantum computer. He was the fastest gun in the West. I loved, respected and admired his brilliance - always.""\n\nThis August will be the fourth anniversary of Robin Williams\' death. Williams committed suicide on August 14th. The comedian was diagnosed with diffuse Lewy body dementia, which reportedly caused him to lose some of the energy that he was best known for. Williams was misdiagnosed with Parkinson\'s disease, suffered paranoia, hallucinations, and blank moments at the end of his life. In addition, he didn\'t feel like he could be funny anymore, according to Itzkoff\'s biography.\n\nAs for Jim Carrey, he\'s mostly been focusing on painting as a way of social protest after being cleared in the death of his girlfriend. Carrey is a harsh critic of President Trump and creates very unflattering pieces of artwork that portray the president and his administration. While it could be said that he may be in a feud with Trump, he was never in a ""bitter feud"" with the late great Robin Williams. You can read the rest of Carrey\'s comments on Williams at Gossip Cop.\n\nRobin Williams\xe2\x80\x99 mind was a quantum computer. He was the fastest gun in the West.

But what I saw happening was, if I let my fans into my life and my feelings and what I\xe2\x80\x99m going through my vulnerabilities, my fears, my insecurities it turns out they have all those things, too, and it kind of connects us.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNot only has it connected her and her fans, but it also leaves people dissecting each and every one of her songs to find out which of her romances they are about \xe2\x80\x94 and there are many to choose from.\n\nMost of Swift\xe2\x80\x99s relationships haven\xe2\x80\x99t been all that long-lasting, but they\xe2\x80\x99ve all been known to fuel the tabloids along with rumors that they\xe2\x80\x99re PR stunts.\n\nHowever, she\xe2\x80\x99s somehow managed to keep her most recent relationship with actor Joe Alwyn under wraps \xe2\x80\x94 and they\'ve been dating for over three years now! But that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean there isn\xe2\x80\x99t some interesting stuff going on right under our noses.\n\nHere are a few weird details about Taylor Swift and Joe Alwyn\'s relationship.\n\nBecause behind every talented songstress is a man supporting her (hopefully).\n\nTaylor Swift and Joe Alwyn dated for months without anyone knowing.\n\nIn 2017, Swift all but disappeared from the public eye, which is weird for someone who, until that point, basically had dominated the celebrity news cycle. A source close to Swift had revealed at the time that she stepped away from the spotlight as \xe2\x80\x9cshe felt like her personal life was spinning out of control.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nDuring this time, Swift and Alwyn reportedly started dating, unbeknownst to just about everyone. News of their relationship broke in May 2017 after they allegedly had already been together for months.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter what happened with Tom Hiddleston, they were determined to keep it quiet,\xe2\x80\x9d a source said at the time. ""Taylor has flown in via private jets and her security has made it a military-like mission to prevent her from being seen.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSwift and Alwyn started dating right after her breakup with Tom Hiddleston.\n\nOut of all of Swift\xe2\x80\x99s relationships, the one with Tom Hiddleston is probably the most bizarre. Though it only lasted three months, it was quite a whirlwind.\n\nSwift and Hiddleston broke up in September 2016, and it seems her relationship with Alwyn may have started in October of that year.\n\n""She has been going back and forth between Nashville and the U.K. for the last few months while she has been recording her album,"" a source revealed.\n\nTaylor Swift and Joe Alwyn are rarely seen together.\n\nDespite Swift being \xe2\x80\x9ccrazy about Joe\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9creally excited about their relationship,\xe2\x80\x9d it\xe2\x80\x99s been very rare that we even catch a glimpse of them together \xe2\x80\x94 which is very unlike the country-pop crossover star.\n\nThis leads us to believe Alwyn has had something to do with the change of pace which, according to an insider, is likely the case.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cJoe doesn\'t like attention or have any interest in being a celebrity,\xe2\x80\x9d the source said in 2017, ""She still intends to keep the relationship as private as possible. It\'s sacred to her and she feels that keeping it to themselves has worked out for the best.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTaylor Swift and Joe Alwyn haven\'t walked the red carpet together.\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s one thing to avoid paparazzi, but throughout their relationship so far, Swift and Alwyn have also yet to walk a red carpet together.\n\nArticle continues below\n\nAccording to a source, this is a deliberate way for the couple to keep their relationship together. \xe2\x80\x9c[Taylor]\xe2\x80\x99s grown up a lot in the last few years and realizes how important it is to avoid being in the limelight 24/7 in order to maintain a stable, secure relationship,\xe2\x80\x9d a source reportedly said.\n\nAnd the 2020 Golden Globes was the closest they ever got to actually walking a red carpet together. Although they had both attended the event and were seen together throughout the night, they had made their way down the red carpet separately.\n\nAlwyn doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to be known as \'Taylor Swift\xe2\x80\x99s boyfriend.\'\n\nSwift is about as popular of a celebrity as you can be. And while Alwyn has started to up his status, he\xe2\x80\x99s nowhere near the star Swift is \xe2\x80\x94 yet. And according to a source, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want Swift\xe2\x80\x99s celebrity to eclipse his talent.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cJoe is determined to make it as an actor in his own right, and not to be known just as Taylor Swift\xe2\x80\x99s boyfriend,\xe2\x80\x9d a source close to Joe had reportedly revealed in 2018. \xe2\x80\x9cTaylor is really supportive of Joe\xe2\x80\x99s career, and totally understands why he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to be a red carpet fixture with her.\n\nAlwyn puts his job over everything.\n\nAlwyn\xe2\x80\x99s acting career is still in its infancy, but he\xe2\x80\x99s determined to make it in the industry. According to one of Alwyn\xe2\x80\x99s former classmates, Alwyn is \xe2\x80\x9cmarried to his work.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIt seems Swift knows this, though, and so far, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mind. \xe2\x80\x9cTaylor loves that Joe is so dedicated to his career, and to making it big in his own name, and their relationship is all the happier for it,\xe2\x80\x9d a source revealed.\n\nAre Taylor Swift and Joe Alwyn married already?\n\nIt seems as though all of Swift\xe2\x80\x99s relationships up to this point have been lighthearted and fun (until they weren\xe2\x80\x99t, of course, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve learned in her lyrics).\n\nHowever, there have been some clues pointing to the fact that Alwyn may be the one she\'s ready to get more serious with. In fact, a source revealed in 2018 that she had marriage on the brain at the time. \xe2\x80\x9cTaylor really believes Joe is the one for her,\xe2\x80\x9d the insider said. \xe2\x80\x9cShe wants to get engaged to him.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMarriage rumors resurfaced in January 2020 when fans thought they had seen Swift wearing an engagement ring in her new documentary, Miss Americana. However, there was never any official confirmation that they were (or are) actually engaged.\n\nDid Taylor Swift and Joe Alwyn break up?\n\nSwift just recently dropped her newest album, Folklore, and, naturally, fans have taken to dissecting each and every one of her lyrics. In particular, fans have noted that the new album includes a lot of breakup anthems, which has, in turn, caused a lot of wondering.\n\nThe opening track itself references ""lost love."" However, Swift took to social media to clear some things up about her new songs.\n\nOn Instagram, she wrote, \xe2\x80\x9cI found myself not only writing my own stories, but also writing about or from the perspective of people I\xe2\x80\x99ve never met, people I\xe2\x80\x99ve known, or those I wish I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t. In isolation my imagination has run wild and this album is the result, a collection of songs and stories that flowed like a stream of consciousness. Picking up a pen was my way of escaping into fantasy, history, and memory.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHowever, on other tracks, Swift actually references her relationship with Alwyn in a positive light. In fact, some believe that Alwyn may have even co-written a few of Swift\'s new songs.\n\nMicki Spollen is a YourTango editor, writer, and traveler.

Many fans of Prince believed the use of his image was in poor taste and not something the late musician would have appreciated.\n\nThe National Enquirer is now capitalizing on the controversy by claiming that Timberlake was planning to pay homage to Prince during his 2018 Man of the Woods tour, but scrapped the idea following the Super Bowl backlash. A so-called ""source"" tells the magazine, ""Since the devastating reviews of his Super Bowl performance, all Prince references have been removed.""\n\nBut Gossip Cop checked in with a source close to Timberlake, who exclusively assures us the tabloid\'s story is completely false. We\'re told the singer never planned to include a Prince tribute in his tour. It should be noted, the main reason that Timberlake acknowledged the late singer at the Super Bowl is because the game was played in Prince\'s hometown of Minneapolis.\n\nDuring an appearance on a special post-Super Bowl edition of ""The Tonight Show,"" Timberlake explained to Jimmy Fallon that he honored Prince ""to do something for this city and something for him that would just be the ultimate homage to what I consider the GOAT of musicians."" Despite Timberlake\'s admiration for the late artist, the homage was specifically designed for the Super Bowl in Minneapolis, and he never intended to bring the tribute on the road.\n\nIt\'s also worth noting, the Enquirer seems to know very little about Timberlake\'s career. Gossip Cop previously busted the untrustworthy magazine for wrongly reporting that the singer would be hosting the Oscars. The publication is no better when it comes to covering his personal life, as we\'ve also debunked the outlet\'s many false articles surrounding Timberlake\'s marriage to Jessica Biel. This latest story claiming Prince was supposed to play a part in the singer\'s Man of the Woods tour is equally bogus.\n\nMore on Gossip Cop:\n\nJennifer Aniston did NOT throw Justin Theroux\'s things in trash despite report\n\nRihanna thinking babies with Hassan Jameel is made-up\n\nDo Katy Perry\'s friends want her to dump Orlando Bloom for Jake Gyllenhaal?'"

But Damon has not bought a home there nor is he relocating there, she said.\n\nThe New York Post\xe2\x80\x99s Page Six gossip site, citing an unnamed source, said the Good Will Hunting and Jason Bourne star told friends and colleagues he wanted to leave the country because he disagrees with Mr Trump\xe2\x80\x99s policies.\n\nWhen asked about Damon\xe2\x80\x99s rumoured motivation, Ms Allen wrote in an email, \xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x99s not moving out of the US\xe2\x80\x9d. Damon has publicly supported Democrats, including Mr Trump\xe2\x80\x99s rival in the 2016 presidential election, Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe reports first emerged on Thursday and claimed Damon was moving to Australia along with his four daughters and wife, Luciana Barroso.\n\nDamon has previously shown his lack of support for the President. In January last year, during a panel in Davos, he said America was heading into \xe2\x80\x9cnew territory\xe2\x80\x9d with the President.\n\nMeanwhile, during the 2016 US presidential elections Damon expressed he was \xe2\x80\x9cnervous\xe2\x80\x9d about the prospect of a Trump presidency. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no way we can let this guy be the [president]. To let that dude have the nuclear football, are you kidding me? He\xe2\x80\x99s impulsive and rash and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to think deeply about too many things,\xe2\x80\x9d he said in an interview on ABC\xe2\x80\x99s Popcorn With Peter Travers.\n\nEarlier this week, Damon and Ben Affleck announced they will implement inclusion riders and will employ diverse casts and crews to work on their upcoming projects.

"b'A new picture of Amal Clooney set Instagram afire with speculation that the mother of two might be pregnant again.\n\nPopSugar posted the image on its Instagram account, and it featured actor George Clooney and his wife, Amal, a professor at Columbia, out and about in Sardinia, Italy. The pair had a date night on Monday at Il Marino di Puntaldia just two days before the first birthday of their twins, Alexander and Ella.\n\nHe\xe2\x80\x99s clutching her hand, and she\xe2\x80\x99s wearing a beautiful dragon print dress, while he wore a stylish blue polo shirt with striped pants. While the lovely couple always garners plenty of attention, one thing, in particular, stood out to fans in this picture. Followers quickly pointed out that Amal sported what might be a tiny baby bump in the image.\n\nInstagram user andreal_pez asked, \xe2\x80\x9cIs she pregnant again???\xe2\x80\x9d Of course, another fan had another possible explanation. A poster with the username carefullycuratedcloset said, \xe2\x80\x9cDoes she look a bit preggers or [is] she just having one of THOSE days like the rest of us do??\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIt would entirely be horrifying to see pictures of yourself after date night, and immediately see speculation of a possible pregnancy when the truth is you merely sported a food baby after some delicious food.\n\nLast fall, Amal, told the Hollywood Reporter that she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to have any more children. She said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m 39. I already had them quite late.\xe2\x80\x9d Now, she\xe2\x80\x99s 40 and George is 57, and it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem likely that they\xe2\x80\x99ve changed their minds in the few months since last fall with two toddlers in their household even though she praised her husband as a great father \xe2\x80\x94 a fact that appeared to surprise him.\n\nPlus, there\xe2\x80\x99s the fact that George didn\xe2\x80\x99t even plan to have children. He said, \xe2\x80\x9cIt had never been part of my DNA. We didn\xe2\x80\x99t plan on it. We never talked about it until after we were married, which is funny. There was an assumption that we didn\xe2\x80\x99t want them. And then, after the wedding, Amal and I were talking and we just felt we\xe2\x80\x99d gotten very lucky, both of us, and we should share whatever good luck we\xe2\x80\x99ve got. It would seem self-centered to just have that belong to us.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShortly after deciding to start a family, Amal reportedly got pregnant without the help of fertility drugs, and the couple\xe2\x80\x99s twins came as a big surprise about one month early last June. Could Amal be pregnant again just one year later? Perhaps, but it seems unlikely. However, her dress at the royal wedding a few weeks ago did have some strategic pleating in the midsection.'"
"b""In February I saw a photo of Meghan Markle and the Duchess of Cambridge sitting next to each other at the Royal Foundation Forum, wearing colour coordinated dresses (lavender for Kate, deep purple-blue for Meghan). It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t their dresses I minded, it was how they sat \xe2\x80\x93 legs crossed neatly at the ankle, knees pressed firmly together. It was that dulce et decorum pose passed down to generations of girls and young women expected to demonstrate their good breeding on social occasions \xe2\x80\x93 expected to show they are \xe2\x80\x9cladies\xe2\x80\x9d. Both Kate and Meghan had folded their hands in their laps, the arms forming a gentle circle, the hands quietly clasped, as if ready to shelter a child or calm a kingdom\xe2\x80\x99s cares. But it was the legs that haunted me \xe2\x80\x93 in part because I\xe2\x80\x99d been taught that same bit of etiquette when I was a young black midwestern girl in the 1950s and early 60s, a child of the manners- and achievement-conscious black bourgeoisie, which in those days we called the Negro elite.\n\nIn fact, things turned out better than I\xe2\x80\x99d feared. In a subsequent photo Kate crossed her legs at the knee. And when both women were asked in the video about the causes they planned to take up, Meghan spoke out. The words \xe2\x80\x9cMeToo\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cTime\xe2\x80\x99sUp\xe2\x80\x9d flowed from her lips. So did the words \xe2\x80\x9cI fundamentally disagree\xe2\x80\x9d, as in: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s interesting is \xe2\x80\xa6 when speaking about girls\xe2\x80\x99 and women\xe2\x80\x99s empowerment you\xe2\x80\x99ll often hear people say: \xe2\x80\x98Well, you\xe2\x80\x99re helping women find their voices,\xe2\x80\x99 and I fundamentally disagree with that. Women don\xe2\x80\x99t need to find a voice, they have a voice, and they need to feel empowered to use it, and people need to be encouraged to listen.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMeghan Markle and the Duchess of Cambridge at the Royal Foundation Forum. Photograph: Chris Jackson/AFP/Getty Images\n\nRachel Meghan Markle, for those who have chosen or somehow managed to miss the ceaseless chronicling of her life thus far, is the only daughter of Thomas Markle (white), an Emmy award-winning cinematographer and lighting designer, and Doria Ragland (black), a social worker and yoga instructor who focuses on community mental health. This union of white Hollywood and black social-spiritual activism made her the offspring of a modern and ever more varied biracial bourgeoisie.\n\nThe family settled in Woodland Hills, a prosperous Los Angeles neighbourhood. Prosperous and largely white: Meghan\xe2\x80\x99s mother was regularly mistaken for her nanny there. This must have happened in the 80s and early 90s when she was a young girl; it still happens in the US to every black woman I know who has a mixed-race child.\n\nMeghan\xe2\x80\x99s parents divorced when she was six, and she lived with her mother after that, although she saw her father regularly. There are two half-siblings from his previous marriage, both quite a bit older.

It emerges that the prince has taken Markle to meet his grandmother, the Queen, whose permission they need to marry. They met over afternoon tea at Buckingham Palace. The prince\xe2\x80\x99s aides are reported to have been told to start planning for a royal wedding, with senior members of the royal family asked to look at their diaries to shortlist a series of suitable weekends in 2018. Clarence House announces the engagement, and the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh say they are \xe2\x80\x9cdelighted for the couple and wish them every happiness\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\nThe couple marry before a celebrity-studded congregation at St George's Chapel in the grounds of Windsor Castle.\n\nThe couple's first child, Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor, is born in London. They announce that they are to step back from life as 'senior' royals, triggering a row with Buckingham Palace. After a crisis meeting with the Queen, Prince Charles and Prince William at Sandringham, the Queen issues a statement saying the couple will have a 'transition period' before ending their royal duties. It is announced that Harry and Meghan will drop their HRH titles and repay \xc2\xa32.4m of taxpayers money used to refurbish Frogmore Cottage.\n\nMarkle majored in international relations and theatre at Northwestern University, Illinois.

Yes, she has been praised and criticised as \xe2\x80\x9coutspoken\xe2\x80\x9d, but her style never risks being \xe2\x80\x9caggressive\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9ccombative\xe2\x80\x9d, or any of the other words thrown at women who are deemed insufficiently graceful when they disagree with men. Even when she makes staunch political statements, her manner astutely \xe2\x80\x93 sometimes cloyingly \xe2\x80\x93 balances the forthright and the pleasing. She\xe2\x80\x99s learned to use political maxims and assertions very effectively. As in: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s time to focus less on glass slippers and more on glass ceilings.\xe2\x80\x9d With the word \xe2\x80\x9cfairytale\xe2\x80\x9d now a ubiquitous tag line for the royal romance, this should be a useful daily mantra.\n\nThe Cinderella story refuses to dwindle into a period piece; in the last 20 years alone there have been six film remakes with white, black and Latina leads. But Markle has not been plucked from poverty or \xe2\x80\x93 like the heroines of such romcom adaptations as Pretty Woman and Maid in Manhattan \xe2\x80\x93 from the low-status toil and trouble of working-class life. Her net worth as an actor has been estimated at around $5m. An actor\xe2\x80\x99s fortunes can fluctuate, especially when that actor is a woman. But so can the fortunes of a wife. If the royal marriage were to end in divorce, Markle would not have to depend on the Windsor millions nor, like many once-upon-a-time celebrities, design a skincare or jewellery line for QVC.\n\nAny 'commoner' who marries into any royal family \xe2\x80\x8bis seen as marrying up. But Harry is marrying up too, by marrying out\n\nLove that results in the bride\xe2\x80\x99s near magical social ascent is the key element in Cinderella tales. But is Markle automatically marrying up by marrying a prince? In the old school way, yes: any \xe2\x80\x9ccommoner\xe2\x80\x9d who marries into any royal family is seen as marrying up. But Harry is marrying up too. He\xe2\x80\x99s marrying up by marrying out \xe2\x80\x93 out of long-entwined bloodlines, out of entrenched rituals and hierarchies, out of a lineage as constricted as it is privileged. We always ascribe social ambitions to commoners, but aristocrats have their own longings for a world elsewhere. Harry is marrying into all the possibilities of postmodernity. It\xe2\x80\x99s a world where \xe2\x80\x93 as Zora Neale Hurston said of black folktales and music \xe2\x80\x93 hierarchies, styles, sites of social and cultural change are being made and forgotten every day.\n\nIn this world-elsewhere that is here and now, Markle\xe2\x80\x99s identities as a progressive biracial and black feminist are impeccable. When speaking of her role on TV series Suits, as the biracial lawyer with a black father, she said: \xe2\x80\x9cSome households may never have had a black person in their house as a guest, or someone biracial. Well, now there are a lot of us on your TV and in your home with you.\xe2\x80\x9d And now there are even a few of us in the castles you see on TV.\n\nHow would a global marketer for the royal family describe their marriage? Charles is not going to help the royal brand become fresh and contemporary. William and Kate are contemporary royals \xe2\x80\x93 unpretentious, decent and likable. But they do not suggest risk or daring. Today the House of Windsor is like a venerable and all too predictable fashion house. Its cultural currency depends on history packaged as costume drama: The Queen, The Crown, The King\xe2\x80\x99s Speech, Darkest Hour. To flourish it must attract new designers, new ideas and new muses. And let me end my fashion analogy by noting that in March this year, Virgil Abloh, a Ghanaian American designer, was named artistic director of menswear for Louis Vuitton, a fashion house founded in 1854 when Queen Victoria was on the throne and the royal family had yet to be rebranded as the House of Windsor.\n\nThe Prince and Markle pictured at Kensington Palace in November 2017, just after their engagement was announced. Photograph: Toby Melville/Reuters\n\nPerhaps a better genre through which to read the complexities of the Meghan-Harry narrative is the romantic comedy. In the best romcoms, attraction is ignited by tension and difference. Thwarted too. The characters have to learn something from each other and something about themselves; negotiate across troublesome boundaries (gender and class privilege, temperament), and learn to take emotional risks.\n\nFor this union, Harry has had to renounce his protected status as a vivaciously shallow party boy whose transgressions took the form of booze-fuelled pranks, such as showing up at a friend\xe2\x80\x99s birthday party in a Nazi desert uniform with a swastika armband (the party\xe2\x80\x99s theme was \xe2\x80\x9ccolonial and native\xe2\x80\x9d), or hosting a game of strip poker in a Las Vegas hotel room. Reformation followed in three stages, each appealing to a different constituency. He served in Afghanistan. He recently confessed to emotional and mental health problems that began soon after his mother\xe2\x80\x99s death: a shutdown of feelings, bouts of rage and anxiety followed by psychological counselling.\n\nFinally, there came his involvement with Markle. A professional woman, an educated woman, a 36-year-old divorced American woman, a woman of colour and a feminist whose presence in his life would soon require that he forcefully denounce racism and sexism in the British press (and, I trust, among his more un-woke friends and relations). \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve never wanted to be a lady who lunches \xe2\x80\x93 I\xe2\x80\x99ve always wanted to be a woman who works,\xe2\x80\x9d Markle once said. In show business she worked her way up. She didn\xe2\x80\x99t become a Hollywood superstar; she did become a skilled, well-paid lead in a highly rated TV series. She had a social conscience, which she acted on. And now, she is more famous and more influential than she was ever likely to be on her own. It remains the way of the world. Does Amal Clooney have more resources as a human rights lawyer and philanthropist now that she is married to George Clooney? No doubt.\n\nOnce a woman enters a royal family, every aspect and function of her body becomes a site of proprietary fantasy\n\nWhatever we think of her new job requirements, Markle will remain a working woman with a lifetime of public performances ahead. Every word, every gesture, every detail of dress will be scrutinised and read for subtext. The touches of white on her navy J Crew coat? A tribute to the British suffragettes. Bare legs instead of tights for the engagement photos? A subtle flouting of royal dress proscriptions.\n\nOnce a woman enters a royal family, every aspect and function of her body becomes a site of proprietary fantasy. The female body as a nation\xe2\x80\x99s procreative destiny: the only real change through the centuries is that fantasy has replaced realpolitik. For Diana Spencer, that meant her uncle certifying her virgin status in a tabloid newspaper interview shortly after her engagement to Charles. As if his niece\xe2\x80\x99s body parts were a bride price to be flaunted, eliciting leers and cheers.\n\nFor Markle, it means media warnings that she is 36 years old and shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t wait much longer. \xe2\x80\x9cMeghan, Oh Baby! Meghan and Harry Planning a Honeymoon Knock-Up\xe2\x80\x9d went one headline. Her former husband, producer Trevor Engelson, is also conjuring imaginary children. He has announced plans for a Fox comedy: \xe2\x80\x9cDivorce is hard,\xe2\x80\x9d goes its pitch. \xe2\x80\x9cSharing custody is harder when an ex-wife marries a British prince. Sharing custody with the British royal family in the unforgiving spotlight of London\xe2\x80\x99s tabloid media is next level.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMeghan Markle Looks Gorgeous With Naturally Curly Hair in Childhood.\xe2\x80\x9d The published photo was charming, as is the video of her at 11, with a curly frizzy ponytail, chastising the ad industry for its sexism. Many of us used to ask if we\xe2\x80\x99d ever see Michelle Obama in an updated version of the afro she wore in her pre-public figure days. Many of us used to answer that the furore it would cause \xe2\x80\x93 the afro as proof of the first lady\xe2\x80\x99s secret allegiance to white-hating black militants \xe2\x80\x93 probably wasn\xe2\x80\x99t worth the gesture. And since a small dust-up followed Meghan\xe2\x80\x99s recent appearance in a bun with wavy tendrils around her face, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard alas to imagine how anything, including the claim of biographer Andrew Morton that she is a direct descendant of Robert the Bruce, would atone for a full display of those racially marked curly/wavy/frizzy locks.\n\nMarkle at her aunt\xe2\x80\x99s wedding. Photograph: Mail on Sunday / Solo Syndication\n\nBut if she never wears her version of a natural, she has already done race history a real service. She has helped scuttle false, foolish constructs of \xe2\x80\x9cthe mulatto\xe2\x80\x9d that were developed a few centuries ago to counter the very real threat that mixed-race people posed to the constructs of white supremacy. To serve popular culture, the female mulatto became a source of social and erotic intrigue, a figure who needed strict narrative policing. Stories, novels, plays and early films gave her two options.\n\nShe could be a scheming seductress (see Lydia Brown in DW Griffith\xe2\x80\x99s The Birth of a Nation, the mistress of a gullible white abolitionist played by a panting and grimacing white actress). Or she could be tragic (as in Dion Boucicault\xe2\x80\x99s The Octoroon of 1859, and Charles Chesnutt\xe2\x80\x99s The House Behind the Cedars of 1900), a beautiful, seemingly white woman of faultlessly refined bearing, doomed by the taint of black ancestry. The tragic version attracts the love of a well-born young white man who does not know her secret. She tries \xe2\x80\x93 she hopes, she longs \xe2\x80\x93 to pass for white, and the ruse works for a time. But, when the innocent gentleman proposes marriage, the plot dictates that her shame be revealed and she must die, by her own hand or from a fatal disease.\n\nDecades of scholarship and memoir have corrected and complicated this narrative, of course. Still it lingers and titillates, a handy tool for condescension, suspicion and breezy sneers. A key theme in these stories is the heroine\xe2\x80\x99s terror that, if she marries her white hero, she might bear a child whose skin colour would reveal the dreaded racial truth. I imagine there\xe2\x80\x99s plenty of spiteful, behind-the-scenes chatter about whether this \xe2\x80\x9ctouch of the tarbrush\xe2\x80\x9d will taint Meghan and Harry\xe2\x80\x99s offspring. Perhaps the \xe2\x80\x9cblackamoor\xe2\x80\x9d brooch that Princess Michael of Kent was photographed wearing on her way to a royal event with Harry and Meghan was meant to signify such a dread: Meghan as the black ewe tupped by a white ram, who will produce a shamefully black offspring.\n\nAnd surely the Daily Mail was gesturing towards this when it ran a story about the ostensibly tawdry origins of Markle and her mother, titled: \xe2\x80\x9cHarry\xe2\x80\x99s girl is (almost) straight outta Compton: Gang-scarred home of her mother revealed \xe2\x80\x93 so will he be dropping by for tea?\xe2\x80\x9d Doria Ragland was cast as \xe2\x80\x9ca dreadlocked African American lady from the wrong side of the tracks\xe2\x80\x9d. One whose career as a yoga instructor and social worker suddenly made her the equivalent of the mulatta\xe2\x80\x99s disreputable mother, who gathers roots and practises hoodoo.\n\nEarly rumours had it that Ragland would walk her daughter down the aisle (with her usual dreads, I hoped). Now it\xe2\x80\x99s reported that Markle\xe2\x80\x99s father will, or that they will share the duty. I vote for Ragland alone. Still, to watch a divorced, interracial couple walk the royal red carpet has its own rewards when, once upon a time just 51 years ago, US law forbade their marriage.\n\nLike any black and biracial woman, she has had a lifetime of learning to both confront and navigate codes\n\nIn 2015 Markle wrote an essay for Elle in which she quite eloquently established that she is both biracial and black. She started with the blunt racial slurs of her childhood, which turned, as she grew, into the patronising queries and assumptions favoured by adults who think themselves liberal. A perfect example was the teacher who told her to fill in \xe2\x80\x9cwhite\xe2\x80\x9d on a census because \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s how you look, Meghan\xe2\x80\x9d. Intended as a compliment, no doubt. In the essay, she also discussed the institutional racism exposed by the police shootings in Ferguson and Baltimore. She recalled the flurry of racist tweets set off when Wendell Pierce was cast as her African American father on Suits: \xe2\x80\x9cEw, she\xe2\x80\x99s black? I used to think she was hot.\xe2\x80\x9d Then, having described both her struggles with, and her pride in, being biracial, she ended the essay with a tribute to her black ancestry.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou create the identity you want for yourself, just as my ancestors did when they were given their freedom. Because in 1865 (which is so shatteringly recent), when slavery was abolished in the United States, former slaves had to choose a name. A surname, to be exact. Perhaps the closest thing to connecting me to my ever-complex family tree, my longing to know where I come from, and the commonality that links me to my bloodline, is the choice that my great-great-great grandfather made to start anew. He chose the last name Wisdom. He drew his own box.\xe2\x80\x9d Excellently done, I thought. She\xe2\x80\x99s refusing to let white readers white out her black identity.\n\nWhen it comes to issues of race, gender, sexuality and class, how much can Meghan Markle say and do? How much does she want to say and do? We simply don\xe2\x80\x99t know yet. Like any black and biracial woman, she has had a lifetime of learning to both confront and dextrously navigate codes that range from the puzzling to the vehemently punitive. Like every actress she\xe2\x80\x99s had to confront misogyny. But she has options that previous generations did not.\n\nThe speech she gave at the 2015 UN women\xe2\x80\x99s conference began in rousing, declamatory mode: \xe2\x80\x9cI am proud to be a woman and a feminist\xe2\x80\x9d; moved to personal narrative (this part grounded in the story of how she organised her campaign against that sexist television ad at age 11); then built up to inspirational political exhortation. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is said that girls with dreams become women with vision. May we empower each other to carry out this vision, because it isn\xe2\x80\x99t enough to simply talk about equality, one must believe in it, and it isn\xe2\x80\x99t enough to believe in it, one must work for it.\xe2\x80\x9d May the work recommence once the \xc2\xa332m wedding is done.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 On Michael Jackson by Margo Jefferson is published by Granta.\n\n"""

"b'2018 single by Christina Aguilera\n\n""Fall in Line"" is a song by American singer Christina Aguilera for her eighth studio album Liberation (2018), featuring guest vocals from American singer Demi Lovato. It was released as the album\'s second single on May 16, 2018 by RCA Records, impacting hot adult contemporary radio and contemporary hit radio on June 19 and May 28, respectively.[1][2] Aguilera co-wrote the song with Johnny Simpson, Mark Williams, Audra Mae, Raul Cubina and Jon Bellion, while the production was handled by the latter.\n\n""Fall in Line"" is centered around lyrical themes of female empowerment, being recognized as a feminist anthem.[3] The song received positive reviews from music critics, who commended Aguilera and Lovato\'s vocals, as well as the lyrics and inspiring theme. Commercially, ""Fall in Line"" made minor impact on charts, but reached top-forty positions in Hungary and Guatemala, as well as the digital charts of Greece, Spain and the United States. For promotion, an accompanying lyric video was uploaded onto Aguilera\'s official YouTube channel simultaneously with the song\'s release, followed by a music video directed by Luke Gilford. The singer also performed it on several occasions, including the Carpool Karaoke segment of The Late Late Show with James Corden, 2018 Billboard Music Awards, The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, and Today Show. The song was nominated for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance at the 61st Annual Grammy Awards.[4] This marked Aguilera\'s twentieth Grammy nomination and Lovato\'s second Grammy nomination.\n\nBackground [ edit ]\n\nAguilera described the song: ""I wrote \'Fall in Line\' a few years ago before all this news came out [Time\'s Up and Me Too movement]. It was the song that needed to be heard. Because of what I witnessed when I was growing up I always felt really driven to have a voice that my mom kind of never had in my childhood. So I\'ve always wanted to be that advocate for women and anybody that was struggling to have their own voice. I watched my mom have to be submissive, watch her Ps and Qs or she\'s gonna get beat up. You can either be, unfortunately, so damaged by it that you take a turn for the worse, or you can feel empowered by it and make choices to never go down that route.""[5] In November 2018, the track\'s songwriter and producer Jon Bellion revealed that at one point, Beyonc\xc3\xa9 had tried to secure the song for the R&B duo Chloe x Halle.[6]\n\nIn June 2018, Aguilera appeared on DJ Zane Lowe\'s Beats 1 radio show, giving an interview about Liberation. The singer explained that the track was committed to everyone that felt disempowered, adding: ""It\'s a message that I\'ve preached [...] I think the chorus can fit anybody\'s feeling if they feel repressed, or oppressed, or whatever\'s going on in their lives that they feel they need to come to their own realization"". Aguilera also revealed that she decided to work with Lovato because it was important to choose someone that is vocal about their own struggles and past, stating: ""I wanted somebody that could \'come to play\', and she put so much heart and passion into it [...] I teared up when I first heard her vocal on it. I sent her flowers and I was just like, \'Oh my God, you took it to the next level\'"".[7]\n\nRelease and promotion [ edit ]\n\n""Fall in Line"" premiered on May 16, 2018, at 8 a.m. EST, and was released commercially for digital download worldwide at the same time.[8] Aguilera stated in a tweet: ""To anyone who\'s ever felt silenced and repressed, the truth seekers and bold thinkers...may you liberate your voice and break the mold, never back down, and never fall in line.""[9]\n\nRecording and composition [ edit ]\n\nAguilera co-wrote ""Fall in Line"" alongside Johnny Simpson, Mark Williams, Audra Mae, Jon Bellion, and Raul Cubina, while the production was handled by Jon Bellion. The track was recorded at The Guest House in Hollywood Hills, California, while the mixing was handled by Manny Marroquin at Larrabee Sound Studios. The mastering was performed by Dave Kutch at The Mastering Palace, New York City. Instrumentation for the song included trumpet and flugelhorn by Ryan Svendsen.[10] The song is performed in the key of C major with a slow tempo of 40 beats per minute, and the vocals span from B\xe2\x99\xad 2 to C 6, with Lovato\'s belting range reaching up to a B\xe2\x99\xad 5 .[11]\n\n""Fall in Line"" has been described as a ""feminist anthem"" and a sequel to Aguilera\'s 2003 song, ""Can\'t Hold Us Down"" with a lyrical content of women\'s rights.[12][13][14] The introduction to the song is the track ""Dreamers"", which ""features a group of young girls declaring goals like \'I want to be a journalist,\' \'I want to be heard,\' \'I want to be president.\'"" Aguilera stated that the track was recorded a few years ago and before movements such as Time\'s Up and Me Too came out. She added: ""It was the song that needed to be heard. Because of what I witnessed when I was growing up I always felt really driven to have a voice that my mom kind of never had in my childhood. So I\'ve always wanted to be that advocate for women and anybody that was struggling to have their own voice.""[15]\n\nCritical reception [ edit ]\n\npictured in 2018). ""Fall In Line"" features Demi Lovato ().\n\nJon Pareles from New York Times felt that ""Fall in Line"" is ""addressed directly to \'little girls\'"", pointing out the lyric ""You do not owe them your body and your soul"",[16] while Brittany Spanos from Rolling Stone described the track as an ""empowering duet"".[17] During a review for Liberation for USA Today, Patrick Ryan said that the song is a ""soulful riff-off"", and Aguilera and Lovato are ""belting to the rafters as they preach to young girls the importance of speaking their minds and being themselves"".[18] Chuck Arnold from New York Post described the song as ""torchy"" and ""fiery"", also stating that ""Fall in Line"" is ""defiant duo"".[19] Nicholas Hautman of US Weekly described the track as ""anthemic"" and felt that ""the duet continues the theme of female empowerment with #MeToo-era lyrics such as, \'I got a mind to show my strength / And I got a right to speak my mind.\'""[20] Ilana Kaplan and Joe Goggins from Independent felt that ""Fall in Line"" is a standout on Liberation, describing it as a ""impassioned feminist anthem"", and also stating that Aguilera and Lovato are ""two of the best vocal powerhouses in the game"".[21]\n\nDaniel Kreps of Rolling Stone called Aguilera and Lovato\'s singing abilities ""remarkable"" and deemed the final chorus a ""skyscraping duet"".[22] Gil Kaufman of Billboard described the track as ""a towering empowerment anthem"".[23] Rebecca Farley of Refinery29 described the track as Aguilera\'s 2002 song ""Beautiful""-meets-Lovato\'s 2017 song ""Sorry Not Sorry"", calling both singers as ""obstreperous pop performers who are done being sorry"".[24] The BuzzFeed editor provided a supporting commentary, calling the song ""a power anthem"".[25]\n\nCommercial performance [ edit ]\n\nIn the United States, the song entered at number 39 on the Billboard Digital Songs chart with only two days of sales, since the song was released towards the end of the tracking week.

Aguilera stated on Twitter, ""Fall In Line is as much about supporting each other as it is about self-empowerment. I wanted to convey that in this video by visually representing the imprisonment that so many of us have felt, and the freedom we can achieve together.""[34] According to Billboard and Rolling Stone, ""The oppressive, male-dominated prison facility is a clear critique on society\'s oppression of women.""[35][36]\n\nLive performances [ edit ]\n\nAguilera made the live performance debut of ""Fall in Line"" on Carpool Karaoke episode 471, which was first broadcast on May 16.[37][38] She performed the song with Lovato at the 2018 Billboard Music Awards four days later.[39] The song was also added to the set list of the European leg of Lovato\'s Tell Me You Love Me World Tour.[40] On 14 June, Aguilera performed ""Think"", ""Fighter"" and ""Fall in Line"" on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.[41] The next day, she performed ""Can\'t Hold Us Down"", ""Fall in Line"" and ""Fighter"" on Today Show.[42] Aguilera also performed the song on her ongoing residency and tour, The Xperience and The X Tour respectively.\n\nCredits and personnel [ edit ]\n\nRecording and management\n\nPersonnel\n\nChristina Aguilera \xe2\x80\x93 vocals, songwriting\n\nDemi Lovato \xe2\x80\x93 vocals\n\nJon Bellion \xe2\x80\x93 songwriting, production, background vocals\n\nAudra Mae \xe2\x80\x93 songwriting, background vocals, additional vocals\n\nMark Williams \xe2\x80\x93 songwriting, co-production\n\nRaul Cubina \xe2\x80\x93 songwriting, co-production\n\nJonathan ""Johnny"" Simpson \xe2\x80\x93 songwriting, recording, co-production\n\nMitch Allan \xe2\x80\x93 Demi Lovato vocal production\n\nRyan Svendsen \xe2\x80\x93 trumpet, flugelhorn\n\nOscar Ramirez \xe2\x80\x93 Christina Aguilera vocal engineering\n\nScott Robinson \xe2\x80\x93 additional vocal engineering\n\nManny Marroquin \xe2\x80\x93 mixing\n\nChris Galland \xe2\x80\x93 mix engineering\n\nRobin Florent \xe2\x80\x93 mix assistance\n\nScott Desmarais \xe2\x80\x93 mix assistance\n\nDave Kutch \xe2\x80\x93 mastering\n\nCredits adapted from Liberation.[10]\n\nCharts [ edit ]\n\nRelease history [ edit ]'"
"b'She may not have won the Oscar, but there\xe2\x80\x99s shortage of blockbuster roles for actress Ruth Negga, who is next set to star alongside Hollywood A-lister Brad Pitt.\n\nThe Irish-Ethiopian beauty has reportedly signed on to feature in upcoming sci-fi adventure Ad Astra.\n\nThe film tells the story of a man\xe2\x80\x99s journey across a lawless and unforgiving solar system to find his missing father, a scientist who poses a threat to all mankind.\n\nThe flick will be directed by James Grey and also rumoured to be lined-up for a part is silver screen is veteran Tommy Lee Jones. Details about and Pitt \xe2\x80\x93 also on board as a producer \xe2\x80\x93 and Negga\xe2\x80\x99s role are being kept under wraps for now.\n\nLast year Negga, 35, attracted international attention when she received an Academy Award nomination for her role in the historical drama Loving. Although she missed out on the Best Actress gong at the ceremony in February, she\xe2\x80\x99s clearly not stuck for work.\n\nIFTA winner Negga, who initially rose to fame on home shores in RTE\xe2\x80\x99s Love/Hate and E4 series Misfits, is currently starring in season two of AMC\xe2\x80\x99s comic book adaptation Preacher. The actress appears opposite her other half, British boyfriend Dominic Cooper, 39, in the drama.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98It would be so lonely if he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t there,\xe2\x80\x99 she said about working with her leading man.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98People say, \xe2\x80\x9cNever go out with an actor.\xe2\x80\x9d But if you were with someone with a normal job, and one of you had to go away, how would that work?\xe2\x80\x99\n\nThe couple, who have been together since 2009, maintain a low-profile approach to their relationship.\n\nHowever, last month in an interview with Net-a-Porter\xe2\x80\x99s The Edit, Negga gave some insight into her romance with Cooper and spoke about the idea of having children. She revealed she is constantly thinking about \xe2\x80\x98when\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98if\xe2\x80\x99 she would like children.\n\nNegga said: \xe2\x80\x98By the time you\xe2\x80\x99re in a great relationship, it\xe2\x80\x99s like, oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m 35. S***. So there is part of your thinking that is: \xe2\x80\x9cDo I want kids? When? If? How?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s there, all the time, preoccupying me. And that\xe2\x80\x99s not being an actor, it\xe2\x80\x99s being a woman.

"b'There was no shortage of celebrity beefs in 2017.\n\nWhether the fights were between co-stars or once close friends, the shade just kept coming. Let\'s take a look back at the most intense celebrity feuds of the year.\n\n1. Blac Chyna vs. Rob Kardashian\n\nBlac Chyna and Rob Kardashian\'s split turned a new level of nasty when the former couple exchanged wild accusations against one another in a heated, NSFW social media war in June. Kardashian shared graphic naked photos of Chyna, accused her of cheating on him multiple times and also accused her of being on drugs. Meanwhile, Chyna took to Snapchat to accuse Kardashian of also cheating on her and being physically abusive.\n\nOne month later, a judge granted Chyna\'s request for a temporary restraining order against Kardashian.\n\n""Revenge porn is a form of domestic abuse,"" Chyna\'s attorney, Lisa Bloom, said during a press conference.\n\nGreg Doherty/Getty Images\n\nBut the two now appear to be keeping it amicable when it comes to their daughter, 1-year-old Dream. In September, the two reached a custody agreement.\n\n""Chyna is pleased that Rob has agreed to peacefully co-parent Dream with her, as she has been requesting all along,"" Bloom said in a statement.\n\nKardashian\xe2\x80\x99s attorney, Robert Shapiro, also told ET at the time that ""Rob and Chyna are working together to put the best interest of their child first and have amicably resolved their personal matters.""\n\nOf course, Chyna is still suing Kardashian, his mom Kris Jenner and sister Kim Kardashian West over the cancellation of E!\xe2\x80\x99s Rob & Chyna.\n\n2. Dwayne Johnson vs. Tyrese Gibson\n\nAlberto E. Rodriguez/Getty Images\n\nThe drama between the Fast and Furious co-stars began in September, when Gibson left a comment on Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s Instagram post, asking him not to let a rumored spinoff film starring Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s character, Agent Hobbs, push back the planned release date of Fast 9.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m simply trying to reach him cause he won\xe2\x80\x99t call me back about this solo #HobbsMovie,\xe2\x80\x9d Gibson wrote in the lengthy comment. \xe2\x80\x9cI want you to shoot it just not right now cause the #Fast9 release date has already been announced.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe feud escalated one month later, when Gibson called out Johnson on Instagram, and slammed his critical and commercial flop, Baywatch.\n\n\n\nJohnson defended himself on Twitter.\n\n""My goal from day 1 was to come in and create an exciting/fun character for the fans, elevate the franchise and build it out,"" he tweeted.\n\nGibson also took to Twitter, to call his co-star ""selfish.""\n\n""The real selfish #CandyA** revealed,"" Gibson wrote. ""And why you on Twitter?? You lost my number right? I\'m at you when I see you #Family.""\n\n""You still promoting a movie that no one wants to see made you clown,"" he continued.\n\nOf course, Johnson didn\'t take the shady tweets lying down.\n\n""Pumped to expand and build out the FAST & FURIOUS universe in a cool, exciting way,"" Johnson captioned yet another Instagram post, adding, ""Thank you UNIVERSAL STUDIOS for being tremendous partners who see the big picture and for coming to us years ago with this spinoff idea.""\n\n\n\n""I have a tremendous amount of respect for this franchise that I\xe2\x80\x99ve enjoyed droppin\xe2\x80\x99 blood and sweat in over the years,"" he continued. ""And my vision is to create greater opportunities for not only my fellow FF cast mates, but for other amazing actors as well who want to be a part of something new and cool.The more opportunities we can create the better for the fans. Smart business,"" he argued. ""Let\xe2\x80\x99s have some FUN and to quote, Hobbs the boss, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t like it, we\xe2\x80\x99re happy to beat that a** like a Cherokee drum. #CandyA**esNeedNotApply.""\n\nAlthough Gibson Instagrammed in November that he was out of the Fast and the Furious franchise if Johnson was in, he later claimed he was ""never mad"" at Johnson .... though continued to slam him.\n\n""So the Rock how does it feel bro?.... going home to your daughter every night,"" he asked, referencing his highly publicized custody battle over daughter Shayla. ""It was 60 days before I seen my baby..... and all I asked you to do \'privately\' was NOT accept a role that would deeply affect us all....... You are simply NOT the people\xe2\x80\x99s champ..... you are a selfish champ.""\n\n3. Kanye West vs. JAY-Z\n\nGetty Images\n\nThe two close friends and collaborators\' falling out continued this year, after West publicly called JAY-Z out during an onstage concert rant last November.\n\n""You got hurt, because this guy was talking about you on a stage,"" JAY-Z commented in August during an interview with Elliott Wilson and Brian ""B.Dot"" Miller on the Rap Radar podcast. ""But what really hurt me, you can\'t bring my kid or my wife into it. Like, Kanye is my little brother. He\'s talked about me a hundred times. He even made a song called \xe2\x80\x98Big Brother.\' We\'ve gotten past bigger issues, but you brought my family into it, now it\'s a problem.""\n\nIn July, West reportedly left JAY-Z\xe2\x80\x99s Tidal over a money dispute.\n\nHowever, there is hope for those wishing for a Watch the Throne part two. During a Q&A with New York Times executive editor Dean Baquet for T: The New York Times Style Magazine in November, JAY-Z had a few conciliatory words for West, whom he still referred to as his ""brother.""\n\n""I [talked to] Kanye the other day, just to tell him, like, he\'s my brother,"" he recalled. ""I love Kanye. I do. It\'s a complicated relationship with us.""\n\nStill, JAY-Z admitted that there\'s currently tension between the two.\n\n""But that happens,"" he stressed. ""In the long relationship, you know, hopefully when we\'re 89 we look at this six months or whatever time and we laugh at that. There\'s gonna be complications in the relationship that we have to get through. And the only way to get through that is we sit down and have a dialogue and say, \'These are the things that I\'m uncomfortable with. These are the things that are unacceptable to me. This is what I feel.\' I\'m sure he feels that I\'ve done things to him as well. I\'m not a perfect human being by no stretch.""\n\n""[West is] a very compassionate person,"" he added. And a lot of times he get in trouble trying to help others, So, I can identify with it. It\'s just that there\'s certain things that happened that\'s not really acceptable to me. ... And we just need to speak about it. But there\'s genuine love there.""\n\n4. Camila Cabello vs. Fifth Harmony\n\nGetty Images\n\nThings turned messy between girl group Fifth Harmony and Camila Cabello pretty quickly after she announced she was leaving the group last December, and the remaining members -- Lauren Jauregui, Ally Brooke, Normani Kordei and Dinah Jane -- claimed in a statement that they only learned of her departure through her representatives.\n\nIn an interview with Billboard in February, Cabello talked about the \xe2\x80\x9cintense\xe2\x80\x9d split and admitted she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t spoken to her former bandmates.\n\n""I was always super open [that] I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t just sing other people\xe2\x80\x99s words and be totally happy with that,"" Cabello said of exiting the group. ""You have to follow and honor that inner voice. I always encouraged the girls to do the same.""\n\n""I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get into the details of that, because it was really intense and it\xe2\x80\x99s hard for me to talk about,"" she added about not keeping in touch. ""It makes me sad.""\n\nIn their own Billboard interview in July, Fifth Harmony wasn\xe2\x80\x99t shy about alluding to the bad blood.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s just say we\xe2\x80\x99re in a better place now -- there are no secrets in this circle,\xe2\x80\x9d Jane said of Cabello\'s exit.\n\nHowever, the shadiest moment definitely happened at the MTV Video Music Awards in August, when before their performance of ""Angel"" and ""Down,"" a a fifth member of the group -- presumably meant to represent Cabello -- fell backwards off the stage.\n\nThe group later denied they were slamming Cabello during an interview with Good Morning America.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe get asked all the time if we\xe2\x80\x99re getting a fifth member,\xe2\x80\x9d Brooke explained. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd we wanted to show the world in an artistic way that, \xe2\x80\x98Hey, the four of us are Fifth Harmony. We are stronger and better than we\xe2\x80\x99ve ever been.""\n\n5. Kim Cattrall vs. Sex and the City Cast\n\nNew Line Cinema\n\nRumors have floated around for some time now that Kim Cattrall didn\'t get along with her Sex and the City cast members, and they were pretty much confirmed this year, after Sarah Jessica Parker announced that there would be no Sex and the City 3 film.\n\n""It\'s over... we\'re not doing it,"" she told Extra. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m disappointed. We had this beautiful, funny, heartbreaking, joyful, very relatable script and story. It\xe2\x80\x99s not just disappointing that we don\xe2\x80\x99t get to tell the story and have that experience, but more so for that audience that has been so vocal in wanting another movie.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe Daily Mail later reported that it was Cattrall\'s ""demands"" that put a stop to the project, claiming she insisted that Warner Bros. produce other movies she had in development before signing onto SATC 3. Cattrall denied the report on Twitter.\n\nWoke 2 a @MailOnline \xf0\x9f\x92\xa9storm! The only \'DEMAND\' I ever made was that I didn\'t want to do a 3rd film....& that was back in 2016 \xe2\x80\x94 Kim Cattrall (@KimCattrall) September 29, 2017\n\nCattrall then specifically called out Parker during an interview with Piers Morgan for ITV\'s Life Stories.\n\n""At this very moment, it\xe2\x80\x99s quite extraordinary to get any kind of negative press about something that I\xe2\x80\x99ve been saying for almost a year,"" she noted. ""This is really where I take to task the people from Sex and the City, specifically Sarah Jessica Parker, in that I think she could have been nicer,"" she expressed to Morgan. ""I really think she could have been nicer.""\n\n""I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what her issue is, I never have,"" she added.\n\nCattrall also said she was never friends with her SATC co-stars, including Cynthia Nixon and Kristin Davis.\n\n""We\xe2\x80\x98ve been colleagues and in some ways, it\xe2\x80\x99s a very healthy place to be because then you have a clear line between your professional life and relationship and your personal,"" she noted. ""They all have children and I am 10 years older, and since, specifically, the series ended, I have been spending most of my time outside of New York, so, I don\xe2\x80\x99t see them. The common ground that we had was the series, and the series is over.""\n\nThough she did admit that she wishes her co-stars would try harder to keep in touch, after sharing that she couldn\'t even recall the last time she had spoken to them.\n\n""That\xe2\x80\x99s another thing that\xe2\x80\x99s really disappointing, is that nobody ever picks up the phone and tries to contact you and say, \xe2\x80\x98How you doing?\xe2\x80\x99"" she shared.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa6. And it appears the cast is taking sides. Willie Garson -- who portrayed Stanford Blatch, the best friend of Carrie Bradshaw (Parker) in both the TV series and the movies -- posted a cryptic tweet in October that appeared to be aimed at Cattrall. Cattrall repeatedly denied that she ever considered doing a third SATC movie and further claimed that she never began contract negotiations.\n\n""Dear fans, because I\'m ""toxic,"" I\'m going to negotiate a contract for 6 months, not come to terms, then say I never wanted to do it anyway,\'"" he wrote.\n\nDear fans, because I\'m ""toxic"", I\'m going to negotiate a contract for 6 months, not come to terms, then say I never wanted to do it anyway. \xe2\x80\x94 Willie Garson \xf0\x9f\x87\xba\xf0\x9f\x87\xb8 (@WillieGarson) October 4, 2017\n\n6. Katy Perry vs. Taylor Swift\n\n\n\nGetty Images\n\nThe epic Katy Perry vs. Taylor Swift feud continued with the promotion of both their respective albums this year -- Perry\'s Witness and Swift\'s Reputation. Perry didn\'t hold back during her Carpool Karaoke segment with James Corden in June, addressing the beef head-on.\n\n""Honestly, it\'s really like she started it and it\'s time for her to finish it,"" Perry said after the Late Late Show host asked her to clear things up. ""She wouldn\'t speak to me. I do the right thing any time that it feels like a fumble. It was a full shutdown and then she writes a song about me and I\'m like, \'OK, cool, cool, cool. That\'s how you wanna deal with it?\'""\n\nIn an interview with NME, Perry gave background on why she decided to address the feud with Corden.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean, I\xe2\x80\x99m not Buddha -- things irritate me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI wish that I could turn the other cheek every single time, but I\xe2\x80\x99m also not a pushover, you know? Especially when someone tries to assassinate my character with little girls [her fans]. That\xe2\x80\x99s so messed up!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThough Swift stayed silent on Perry\'s comments about her, she let her actions do the talking. Swift surprisingly announced on June 8 that her entire catalog will return to all streaming services at midnight -- just when Perry\'s Witness dropped.\n\nSwift also took thinly veiled digs at Perry in her ""Look What You Made Me Do"" music video that dropped in August. Swift dresses up very similar to Perry in the shade-filled video and gets into a car crash -- a moment that looks very close to the accident in Perry\'s ""Unconditionally"" music video. She also pointedly holds a GRAMMY, highlighting that she has 10 accolades, while Perry has zero.\n\nLater, Swift is in a vault, robbing a bank and wearing a sweatshirt that features a glittery tiger, along with a cat mask, seemingly mocking the name of Perry\'s fanbase, KatyCats.\n\nYouTube\n\n7. Caitlyn Jenner vs. The Kardashians\n\nGetty Images\n\nCaitlyn Jenner\'s relationship with the Kardashian family deteriorated after the August release of her memoir, The Secret of My Life, which didn\'t exactly paint the Kardashians in a positive light. Kris Jenner claimed on Keeping Up With the Kardashians that Caitlyn\'s stories about her were ""all made up.""\n\n""My mom has been so fair to Cait, and Cait just has no decency towards my mom whatsoever,"" Kim Kardashian West later told KUWTK cameras, clearly siding with her mother. ""I feel like my mom is carrying this burden and feeling like she had to maintain a relationship with Caitlyn for all the kids. But we\'re grown up. I don\'t think my mom has to try anymore. It\'s time to move on.""\n\nIn September, Caitlyn said she hadn\'t spoken to Kris or Kim since the book\'s release.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI went overboard to be nice, to be friendly, to be open, but also tell my story and my side of the story,\xe2\x80\x9d Caitlyn said during an appearance on Good Morning Britain. \xe2\x80\x9cSince the book came out, I\xe2\x80\x99ve never talked to Kris again. Kim, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t talked to in six, nine months, whatever it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n""It\xe2\x80\x99s unfortunate, because actually Kim was the first one I talked to about this issue,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued. ""She was very straightforward with me. She\xe2\x80\x99s been very, very good on it. It\xe2\x80\x99s a big loss in my life, not having her there anymore. To me, I mean, that\xe2\x80\x99s sad.""\n\nCurrently, the relationship is showing no signs of repair.\n\nThe I Am Cait star spoke to students at Cambridge Union in England in November, where amid discussing her 2015 transition and its aftermath, she revealed that she and Kim haven\'t spoken in ""a year.""\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s been a little bit tough over the last couple of years on the Kardashian side,"" Caitlyn acknowledged. ""To be honest, I don\'t talk to them anymore. Kim, I haven\'t talked to in a year.""\n\n""They don\'t want me in their lives, they bashed me pretty badly,"" she continued. ""It\'s devastating when your kids do that. It really hurt.""\n\n8. Drake Bell vs. Josh Peck\n\nGetty Images\n\nThe state of the Drake & Josh co-stars\' friendship made headlines in June, when Bell made it clear he was upset that he wasn\'t invited to Peck\'s wedding to Paige O\'Brien. Although Bell wasn\'t present at the ceremony, Peck\'s Grandfathered co-star, John Stamos, was, as well as Jason Nash, whom Peck also acted with on Drake & Josh.\n\nIn now deleted tweets, Bell made his feelings known.\n\n""When you\'re not invited to the wedding the message is clear\xe2\x80\xa6"" Bell tweeted. ""Loyalty is key\xe2\x80\xa6 ALWAYS remember where you came from.""\n\n""True colors have come out today,"" he added. ""Message is loud and clear. Ties are officially cut. I\'ll miss ya brotha.""\n\nFor his part, Peck made it clear that he no longer had a close relationship with Bell during his appearance on the Allegedly with Theo Von & Matthew Cole Weiss podcast.\n\nET spoke to Bell in July, when he explained the emotional tweets.\n\n""We\'ve been together 18 years, Josh and me, me and Josh,"" Bell shared. ""We\'ve been so close, it was just one of those things where, you know, I\'d been talking to him, and he\'s been telling me about the engagement. And then I saw on social media, the wedding, and I didn\'t hear about it. So, it was just one of those things where it was just like, \'You didn\'t even tell me?! I had to find out on social media?\' And then you\'re like, \'You know what!? Fine!\' and then I\'m like, wait, I probably shouldn\'t have done that.""\n\n""Yeah, I said the ties are cut or whatever, but I should have just texted that to him, you know,"" he continued. ""I was just being cranky.""\n\nTo solidify that the two had no hard feelings, they later reunited at the MTV VMAs in August.\n\n9. Justin Bieber vs. Marilyn Manson\n\n\n\nMatt Winkelmeyer, Kevin Mazur/Getty Images\n\nOne of the most bizarre feuds of the year was between pop star Justin Bieber and goth rocker Marilyn Manson. During an interview with Billboard in September, Manson said he confronted Bieber at a bar when he saw that the ""Sorry"" singer was selling shirts with Manson\'s face on the front and Bieber\'s name on the back, as part of his official Purpose World Tour merchandise.\n\n""I saw a little girl in a pink hoodie with blond hair, and it turns out to be Bieber. I sit down, and I say, \'Hey, so you wore my shirt and everything onstage,\'"" Manson recalled. ""He was one of those touchy people that hit you when they talk, and he comes up to about d**k height. Then he goes, \'I made you relevant again.\'""\n\nManson said he got revenge by not showing up to a planned duet between the two at Bieber\xe2\x80\x99s show that he suggested.\n\n""I reply, \'That was a great idea you had about doing [my song] \'The Beautiful People\' at your show at Staples Center tomorrow.\' And he goes, \'Yeah, it was,\' not knowing that I told him an idea that I had just made up,"" Manson shared. ""His tour manager sat down, and I asked, \'What time is sound check tomorrow? What time should I be there? Because we\xe2\x80\x99re going to do \'Beautiful People.\xe2\x80\x99 Obviously, when 4 p.m. rolled around the next day, I just didn\'t show.""\n\nManson later claimed Bieber apologized to him through text during Manson\xe2\x80\x99s appearance on Howard Stern\'s Sirius XM show.\n\nQuoting Bieber\xe2\x80\x99s supposed texts, Manson read, \xe2\x80\x9cHonestly, I totally thought we hit it off. My bad. If I was an a**hole, it wasn\'t my intention.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n""I don\'t really care about the media,"" Manson continued to read from Bieber\'s supposed texts. ""I just wanna make sure you and I were good. \xe2\x80\x98Cause I like you.""\n\nManson further reflected on their feud.\n\n""He sassed me and he apologized,"" Manson explained. ""And I said I wouldn\'t s**t talk him, so I wouldn\'t s**t talk him.""\n\n'"

They just couldn\xe2\x80\x99t stand him.\n\n\'I think it was Michael Eisner, the head of Disney at the time, who was quoted as saying, ""He\xe2\x80\x99s ruining the movie.""\'\n\nAfter working on so many independent, quirky films like Sleepy Hollow and Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas, Depp\'s performance in the first Pirates film in 2003 brought him back to the mainstream.\n\nBut it appeared the actor decided to have a bit of fun with Disney executives, who were used to releasing clean-cut, family-friendly entertainment.\n\n\n\nThe 47-year-old, currently promoting new film The Tourist, says he wasn\'t bothered by who he calls \'Upper-echelon Disney-ites, going, ""What\xe2\x80\x99s wrong with him?

Which really made her nervous.\'\n\nIn the interview in Vanity Fair magazine, conducted by American singer Patti Smith, Depp also reveals how he was careful not to stand too close to his The Tourist co-star Angelina Jolie during filming in Venice, in case they gave the wrong impression.\n\nIn order to avoid speculation about an on-set affair, the actor says he went to great lengths, including \'having to hide, sometimes not even being able to talk to each other in public because someone will take a photograph and it will be misconstrued.\'\n\nThe father-of-two says he was apprehensive about meeting Jolie before filming: \'You don\xe2\x80\x99t know what she might be like - if she has any sense of humor at all,\' he tells Smith.\n\n\n\n\'I was so pleased to find that she is incredibly normal, and has a wonderfully kind of dark, perverse sense of humour.\'\n\nEccentric: The actor reveals how one studio boss asked him: \'What\xe2\x80\x99s wrong with him? Is he, you know, like some kind of weird simpleton? Is he drunk? Is he gay?\'\n\nHe also found sympathised with the paparazzi attention she and partner Brad Pitt attracted on set.\n\nHe explained: \'Poor thing, dogged by paparazzi, her and her husband (sic), Brad\xe2\x80\xa6all their kids.\n\n\n\n\'There are times when you see how ridiculous is this life, how ludicrous it is, you know, leaving your house every morning and being followed by paparazzi.\'\n\nThe pair spent several months in the Italian city filming for the thriller, which is released on December 10, in Spring this year.\n\nMeanwhile Depp has just completed filming Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides, in London.\n\nAvoiding rumours: Depp was careful not to look to close with his The Tourist co-star, Angelina Jolie, pictured together during filming in Venice\n\nThe latest installment sees Depp step back into Sparrow\'s shoes alongside new addition Penelope Cruz.\n\nHe has also signed on to return to the Caribbean in adventure-drama The Rum Diary with Aaron Eckhart and Giovanni Ribisi, about a journalist working for a run-down newspaper in the Caribbean.\n\nBut there is one character he is itching to try his hand at. \'Marlon Brando said, ""Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you just take a year and go and study Shakespeare, or go and study Hamlet. Go and work on Hamlet and play that part. Play that part before you\xe2\x80\x99re too old.""\n\n\n\n\'So what he was trying to tell me was: ""play that f****** part, man. Play that part before you\xe2\x80\x99re too long in the tooth. Play it."" And I would like to. I\xe2\x80\x99d really, really like to.\'\n\nDo you have a story about a celebrity?

"b'Prince Harry has turned over a new, more healthful, leaf.\n\nThe once famous party boy appears to have completely changed his ways now that he is engaged to American actress Meghan Markle.\n\nWhile everyone certainly expected the prince to give up a few of his wild child antics, like partying in Vegas and hanging out in London pubs, Markle has reportedly influenced her future husband so greatly that he\xe2\x80\x99s even dropped one of his worst habits: smoking.\n\nAccording to Business Insider, just a few short years ago the popular royal could go through a pack of cigarettes a day, but now that he\xe2\x80\x99s betrothed to Markle, who lives an exceptionally healthy lifestyle, he has reportedly kicked the nasty addiction.\n\nImage zoom Credit: Getty Images\n\n""Harry has promised no smoking at all at home.

Harry has quit for Meghan.""\n\nAnd it\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing she stepped in to help Harry quit, because smoking inside their home at Kensington Palace is actually banned. As a royal staff member told the Daily Mail, \xe2\x80\x9cRoyal Household sites have been smoke free premises since November 21, 2016.\xe2\x80\x9d This includes Kensington, Buckingham, Windsor Castle, St James\xe2\x80\x99s Palace, and all other homes of the royal family.\n\nHowever, Harry wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the only royal affected by the smoking ban and in need of a cigarette intervention.\n\nAccording to the Daily Mail, Harry\xe2\x80\x99s stepmother Camilla once had a 10 cigarette a day habit, which Prince Charles reportedly hated. Thankfully, she too quit smoking after visiting an alternative health practitioner 15 years ago and has since remained smoke-free.'"

"b""\xc2\xa9 Gossip Cop (Getty Images)\n\nWill Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith are not getting a \xe2\x80\x9c$270 million divorce,\xe2\x80\x9d despite a completely false report. Gossip Cop can debunk the alleged martial drama. We\xe2\x80\x99re told the couple\xe2\x80\x99s relationship is strong.\n\nAccording to RadarOnline, the movie star and his wife have been living \xe2\x80\x9cseparate lives\xe2\x80\x9d for quite some time, and they\xe2\x80\x99re finally ready to end their marriage for good. A so-called \xe2\x80\x9csource\xe2\x80\x9d tells the site, \xe2\x80\x9cThey decided on a trial separation and have barely spent any time together lately\xe2\x80\xa6 The reality is that they\xe2\x80\x99re both getting a taste of the single life and they\xe2\x80\x99re enjoying it. It seems like they\xe2\x80\x99re happier apart.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe outlet\xe2\x80\x99s questionable insider further claims that the couple started growing apart once their kids, Jaden, 19, and Willow, 17, moved out of the house, \xe2\x80\x9cso it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be a surprise if Will and Jada decided they\xe2\x80\x99re better off separated and make this split permanent.\xe2\x80\x9d The alleged source adds, \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re not a traditional couple in any sense and neither of them wants to feel tied down.\xe2\x80\x9d The supposed tipster also maintains that Jada would rather focus on her career than continue \xe2\x80\x9cliving in Will\xe2\x80\x99s shadow.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNone of this is true. Just last week, Gossip Cop called out the Australian magazine NW for wrongly reporting that Smith and his wife had \xe2\x80\x9csecretly split.\xe2\x80\x9d However, a rep for Jada exclusively assured us that the claim was entirely \xe2\x80\x9cfalse.\xe2\x80\x9d Nothing has changed in the short time since. In fact, Smith shared an Instagram video on Wednesday of him and Jada paddle boating around a California lake. Clearly, the happy spouses of 20 years aren\xe2\x80\x99t living \xe2\x80\x9cseparate lives,\xe2\x80\x9d despite what the unreliable blog says.\n\nIt should be noted, RadarOnline has been insisting for years that the couple\xe2\x80\x99s marriage is ending. In 2015, the untrustworthy outlet claimed that Smith and his wife put a \xe2\x80\x9csecret divorce deal\xe2\x80\x9d in place to divide their fortune. Shortly after Gossip Cop debunked the bogus story, the actor took to his Facebook page and dismissed the report as \xe2\x80\x9cfoolishness\xe2\x80\x9d from \xe2\x80\x9cdumb people.\xe2\x80\x9d It seems the same can be said for this latest article.\n\nFor more tabloid tales debunked, read on: Debunking the week's tabloid stories: Jan. 26, 2018"""

"b'Kylie Jenner is hoping sister Kendall has found the right guy with fellow model Anwar Hadid. We\xe2\x80\x99ve got EXCLUSIVE details on how she thinks they\xe2\x80\x99d make beautiful babies together.\n\nKylie Jenner is happy being a young mom to daughter Stormi Webster at just 20, and she\xe2\x80\x99s hoping her supermodel sister Kendall will follow in her footsteps. The 22-year-old was spotted making out with fellow model Anwar Hadid, 18, at the Socialista New York club following the CFDA Awards in New York on June 4. Now Kylie\xe2\x80\x99s already mapping out a future for her sis and her PDA partner. \xe2\x80\x9cStormi has changed Kylie\xe2\x80\x99s life for the better, she\xe2\x80\x99s never been this happy or fulfilled and she can\xe2\x80\x99t stop talking to Kendall about having her family too. Now that she is with someone as awesome as Anwar, Kylie hoping that Kendall will finally settle down,\xe2\x80\x9d a source close to the Kardashian-Jenner clan tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cKylie knows Anwar is good people and is really hoping Kendall will give him a real chance. Kylie\xe2\x80\x99s way ahead of herself, but she\xe2\x80\x99s already talking about how gorgeous Kendall and Anwar\xe2\x80\x99s babies would look, they\xe2\x80\x99d be supermodels for sure,\xe2\x80\x9d our insider continues. Kendall is the only Kar-Jenner who isn\xe2\x80\x99t a mom already, but unlike the rest of her baby-loving family she hasn\xe2\x80\x99t seemed interested in the responsibilities of parenthood yet.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cKylie\xe2\x80\x99s so happy and in love with Travis (Scott) and she wants her sister to have the same thing. She\xe2\x80\x99s very pro-relationship and can\xe2\x80\x99t understand why Kendall is still single. She\xe2\x80\x99s hoping Anwar will fix that,\xe2\x80\x9d our source adds. Kendall has not been one to be super physical with a guy in any of her relationships so the fact that she was all over Anwar is a good sign that there might be more to come from these two. Even if it is a little weird that he\xe2\x80\x99s the little brother of her pals Gigi, 23, and Bella Hadid, 21. Kenny did show interest in him back in 2016, with a flirty Instagram pic of her going in to plant a kiss on his cheek, writing in the caption \xe2\x80\x9cDibs.\xe2\x80\x9d Maybe her wish is finally coming true? He just broke up with girlfriend Nicola Peltz, 23, last month so Kendall didn\xe2\x80\x99t waste any time in making her move. They sure do make for a gorgeous couple.'"
"b'In case you\'re still in denial, here\'s your weekly reminder that Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux are getting divorced after seven years together. And if you were\xe2\x80\x94or maybe, still are\xe2\x80\x94a #Brennifer fan, you\'d know that Jen\'s relationship with Brad Pitt also ended after seven years, leaving us wondering: Is Jen a victim of the ""7-Year Itch""?\n\nThe news of both divorces shocked many fans who\xe2\x80\x94based on how each couple carried themselves until the end of the relationship\xe2\x80\x94didn\'t see it coming. Did we, by chance, miss some sort of discreet signals in their body language that would have given us reason to believe separation was imminent?\n\nMaybe. Here, body language expert Patti Wood analyzes the nonverbal cues found in images of each couple, taken at three different phases of their relationships: the beginning, the marriage, and just before the divorce.\n\nJennifer Aniston and Brad Pitt\n\nGetty Images\n\n1998: When they first met.\n\nWhen Jen and Brad went on their first date in 1998, they gave off relationship vibes via mutual touch. ""We\'re seeing it here, how often he had his arm around her waist, and she would reciprocate with her arm around him,"" Wood explains.\n\n""That kind of ritualistic habit of touching each other in the same way is very comforting to your partner,"" she continues. ""It says, \'When we\'re out together, I\'m going to always do this...I never want to be more than an arms length away.\'""\n\nOne thing to keep in mind about Brad is that he is a ""C personality type,"" according to Wood. This means that his facial expressions are more subtle; he tends to smile less in photos or save his smiles for more intimate, private moments.\n\nGetty Images\n\n2000: When they got married.\n\nNotice Jens\'s smile in this photo. Wood describes it as ""real pleasure,"" which makes a lot of sense considering the photo was taken just months before Brad and Jen\'s wedding. And despite the space between them\xe2\x80\x94which is a huge indicator of distance in a relationship\xe2\x80\x94Wood says the relationship was in a good place; the pull away must have been due to movement here. We know this because other clues override the separation: the smile on Jen\'s face, the way their fingers are interlocked, and the placement of their feet.\n\nFeet were very important in Wood\'s analysis of Brad and Jen. She points out that they often stand on the ""same plane,"" meaning that ""one mate doesn\'t step forward,"" and that ""this is a couple that is equally balanced in power and affection."" This was not the case in Brad\'s relationship with Angelina Jolie, who was always several steps ahead of him in all their photos together.\n\nGetty Images\n\n2004: The year before their divorce.\n\nLook at how unusual\xe2\x80\x94and almost awkward\xe2\x80\x94their bodies are positioned in this photo. It\'s one of the few times we see Brad and Jen not in a mutual touch (think back to the first photo), but rather keeping to themselves by lying their hands flat on their own laps. Also, the fact that Brad\'s leg is crossed away from Jen is a clue that there is some stress in their relationship.\n\n""Jen is making all the effort to be seen with him as his mate, as a unit, and as a couple,"" Wood explains. ""She\'s doing this big lean of her shoulders and a big lean of her head, saying \'We are a couple.\'""\n\nWood, who has studied many photos of Brad and Jen as a couple, says their body language toward the end of their relationship didn\'t show many signs of a split. But she recalls seeing a photo in 2004 of Brad with Angelina on the set of Mr. and Mrs. Smith, and knowing there would be trouble. ""I looked at them on that balcony together and I go, \'She\'s spider woman, she\'s gonna get him.\' I had never been that strong about a photo read before,"" she says.\n\nJennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux\n\nSplash News\n\n2011: When they first met.\n\nIn one of the first photos of Justin and Jen together, we saw him tenderly kissing the side of her head, which Wood says was ""not a top-down kiss,"" meaning it\'s not the kind of kiss that says, ""You\'re my child or you\'re less-than.""\n\nThis was a meaningful embrace that showed equanimity. Wood points out that they stopped walking down the street to share a moment together, and that\'s really important in the beginning of a relationship.\n\n\n\nAlso, notice how Justin and Jen are pressed against each other. This kind of body language ""shows the desire to be closer\xe2\x80\x94to be merged at another level."" There is tension on Jen\'s face, though Wood said this is not a relationship cue, but likely due to being photographed by the paparazzi.\n\nGetty Images\n\n2015: When they got married.\n\nThe newlyweds of three months are pictured in a tight embrace, both leaning toward each other. Jen\'s got her head on Justin\'s shoulder, and their bodies are overlapping\xe2\x80\x94often an indicator of nice sexual connection.\n\nWood says, here, Justin wants to be the strong man, so he\'s very relaxed and has a solemn expression. She points out that Jen almost has a look of sadness or relief.\n\n""She\'s got compressed lips in this photo. It\'s almost like, \'I can\'t believe it. I can\'t believe I have this,\'"" Wood says, adding that her expression would make sense at the time, considering they were just married after having been together for four years.\n\n2017: The year before their divorce.\n\nThe tension is real in this photo of Justin and Jen, taken seven months before they announced their split. Wood first points out Jen\'s downward, tight smile which shows ""a bit of wistfulness or sadness, and that she\'s compressing or withholding. There\'s something she\'s keeping inside.""\n\nWe can\'t know for sure if what\'s making her feel that way is couple-based or not\xe2\x80\x94especially since Justin looks very comfortable and at ease in this photo. Wood says Justin\'s body orientation\xe2\x80\x94slightly angled toward her, not away from her\xe2\x80\x94shows that he is fine being seen as a couple. And Jen\'s making the extra effort here (again!) by placing her hand in his lap. So, there were no mutual signals that would point to divorce here.\n\nGetty Images\n\nConclusion\n\nIn summary: In Brad and Jen\'s relationship there was a balance of power and affection. Throughout their time together, they were often spotted with arms wrapped around each other in a mutual, comforting way.\n\nComparing Justin and Jen\'s relationship, we learned that they were a more sexualized couple. There were many instances of him kissing her forehead or looking into her eyes, which shows there was ""intimacy and heat.""\n\nSo, we\'re left with the ultimate question: Will Jen and Brad get back together? Wood thinks Brad could seek the kind of stability and balance that Jen offered him. Angelina gave him an astonishingly different kind of partnership because she was ""wild,"" and completely opposite of Jen.\n\nHere\'s to waiting and wondering.\n\n\n\nThis content is created and maintained by a third party, and imported onto this page to help users provide their email addresses.

"b'\n\nPitt and Aniston at the Independent Spirit Awards on 3/22/03. Credit: Glenn Harris / PR Photos\n\nBoth Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston have films out that premiere at the Toronto Film Festival later this month, and US is breathlessly reporting that the ex husband and wife might run into each other \xe2\x80\x93 gasp! Aniston , Pitt and his girlfriend Angelina Jolie were sort-of supposed to meet at a charity dinner they were all listed as co-hosting during the Oscars in February. Aniston went to the event for an hour, but Pitt and Jolie were no-shows, which wasn\xe2\x80\x99t surprising as there were 10 other hosts listed and not all of them came to the event. Brad and Angelina went to the Independent Spirit Awards instead, where Angelina first showed off her pregnant belly in a tight black dress.\n\nNow exes Brad and Jennifer, who split up in January, 2005 after four and a half years of marriage, might see each other again at this film festival. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure they\xe2\x80\x99ll be cordial to each other if they end up even speaking. Maybe someone behind the scenes will work to ensure they don\xe2\x80\x99t cross paths though:\n\nBrad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston could reunite at this year\xe2\x80\x99s Toronto International Film Festival, when the exes are debuting their new flicks just two days apart. Pitt, 44, is among the stars who will walk the red carpet gala at the festival for the North American premiere of his Coen Brothers\xe2\x80\x99 flick Burn After Reading on Sept. 5. (Pitt is also expected to attend the Venice Film Festival, where his film screens on August 27.) Meanwhile, Aniston, 39, is scheduled to attend the Toronto fest to promote her romantic comedy Management \xe2\x80\x94 about a traveling art saleswoman fighting off the advances of a flaky motel manager \xe2\x80\x94 which is premiering Sept. 7.\n\n[From US Weekly]\n\nI would bet this meeting never happens and Brad blows in and out of there before Jennifer\xe2\x80\x99s film premieres. He does have six kids at home now and probably can\xe2\x80\x99t be away for several days at a time.\n\nIt also seems like they\xe2\x80\x99ve both moved on despite the tabloid\xe2\x80\x99s unwillingness to let go. Last week a columnist at the Chicago Sun Times reported that an insider claimed Jennifer \xe2\x80\x9cstill is hurting from losing Brad [Pitt] to Angelina [Jolie] \xe2\x80\x94 even after all this time.\xe2\x80\x9d How true do you think that is, though? Maybe she thinks about it once in a while, but surely it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t consume her like it still seems to dominate the press. Three years isn\xe2\x80\x99t a lot of time in the grand scheme of things, but it\xe2\x80\x99s enough time to carve a new life for yourself, which Aniston has surely done \xe2\x80\x93 even if she hasn\xe2\x80\x99t found a lasting love. She\xe2\x80\x99s living single, and it looks like she\xe2\x80\x99s living damn well. A lot of happily attached women would love a taste of that healthy carefree life. They\xe2\x80\x99ll just have to settle for slugging some of that Vitamin water she endorses.'"

"b'American actor, comedian, film producer, director, and writer\n\nBenjamin Edward Meara Stiller (born November 30, 1965) is an American actor, comedian, film producer, film director, and writer. He is the son of the late comedians and actors Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara.[1]\n\nAfter beginning his acting career with a play, Stiller wrote several mockumentaries and was offered his own show, titled The Ben Stiller Show, which he produced and hosted for its 13-episode run. Having previously acted in television, he began acting in films. He made his directorial debut with Reality Bites. Throughout his career he has written, starred in, directed, or produced more than 50 films including The Secret Life of Walter Mitty, Zoolander, The Cable Guy, There\'s Something About Mary, the Meet the Parents trilogy, DodgeBall, Tropic Thunder, the Madagascar series, and the Night at the Museum trilogy. He has also made numerous cameos in music videos, television shows, and films.[2]\n\nStiller is a member of a group of comedic actors colloquially known as the Frat Pack. His films have grossed more than $2.6 billion in Canada and the United States, with an average of $79 million per film.[3] Throughout his career, he has received various awards and honors, including an Emmy Award, multiple MTV Movie Awards, a Britannia Award and a Teen Choice Award.\n\nEarly life\n\nBenjamin Edward Meara Stiller[4][5] was born on November 30, 1965 in New York City[6] and raised on the Upper West Side.[7] His father, comedian and actor Jerry Stiller, was from a Jewish family that emigrated from Poland and Galicia in Central Europe.[8][9][10][11] His mother, actress and comedian Anne Meara, who was from an Irish Catholic background, converted to Reform Judaism after marrying his father.[12][13][14][15] While they ""were never a very religious family"", they celebrated both Hanukkah and Christmas,[16] and Stiller had a Bar Mitzvah.[17][18][19]\n\nHis parents frequently took him on the sets of their appearances, including The Mike Douglas Show when he was 6.[20] He considered his childhood unusual, stating: ""In some ways, it was a show-business upbringing\xe2\x80\x94a lot of traveling, a lot of late nights\xe2\x80\x94not what you\'d call traditional.""[21] His elder sister, Amy, has appeared in many of his productions, including Reality Bites, DodgeBall: A True Underdog Story, and Zoolander.[22][23][24] Stiller displayed an early interest in filmmaking and made Super 8 movies with his sister and friends.[9]\n\nAt age 9, Stiller made his acting debut as a guest on his mother\'s short-lived television series, Kate McShane. In the late 1970s, he performed with the New York City troupe NYC\'s First All Children\'s Theater, playing several roles, including the title role in Clever Jack and the Magic Beanstalk.[25] After being inspired by the television show Second City Television while in high school, Stiller realized that he wanted to get involved with sketch comedy.[25] During his high school years, he was also the drummer of the post-punk band Capital Punishment, which released the studio album Roadkill in 1982. The band\'s bassist, Peter Swann, went on to become (as of 2018 ) an Arizona Court of Appeals Judge.[26][27] The band reunited in 2018 to release a new EP, titled This is Capital Punishment, for Record Store Day.[28] The current status of the band is unknown.\n\nStiller attended The Cathedral School of St. John the Divine and graduated from the Calhoun School in New York in 1983. He started performing on the cabaret circuit as opening act to the cabaret siren Jadin Wong. Stiller then enrolled as a film student at the University of California, Los Angeles.[29] After nine months, Stiller left school to move back to New York City.[19] He made his way through acting classes, auditioning and trying to find an agent.[30]\n\nActing career\n\nEarly work\n\nWhen he was approximately 15, Stiller obtained a small part with one line on the television soap opera Guiding Light, although in an interview he characterized his performance as poor.[31] He was later cast in a role in the 1986 Broadway revival of John Guare\'s The House of Blue Leaves, alongside John Mahoney; the production would garner four Tony Awards.[30]\n\nDuring its run, Stiller produced a satirical mockumentary whose principal was fellow actor Mahoney. Stiller\'s comedic work was well received by the cast and crew of the play, and he followed up with a 10-minute short titled The Hustler of Money, a parody of the Martin Scorsese film The Color of Money. The film featured him in a send-up of Tom Cruise\'s character and Mahoney in the Paul Newman role, only this time as a bowling hustler instead of a pool shark. The short got the attention of Saturday Night Live, which aired it in 1987 and two years later offered Stiller a spot as a writer.[30]\n\nIn the meantime, he had a bit role in Steven Spielberg\'s Empire of the Sun.[32]\n\nIn 1989 Stiller wrote and appeared on Saturday Night Live as a featured performer. However, since the show did not want him to make more short films, he left after four episodes.[30] He then put together Elvis Stories, a short film about a fictitious tabloid focused on recent sightings of Elvis Presley.[33] The film starred friends and co-stars John Cusack, Jeremy Piven, Mike Myers, Andy Dick, and Jeff Kahn.[33] The film was considered a success, and led him to develop the short film Going Back to Brooklyn for MTV; it was a music video starring comedian Colin Quinn that parodied LL Cool J\'s recent hit ""Going Back to Cali"".[34]\n\nThe Ben Stiller Show\n\nProducers at MTV were so impressed with Back to Brooklyn that they offered Stiller a 13-episode show in the experimental ""vid-com"" format.[35] Titled The Ben Stiller Show, this series mixed comedy sketches with music videos and parodied various television shows, music stars, and films. It starred Stiller, along with main writer Jeff Khan and Harry O\'Reilly, with his parents and sister making occasional appearances.[35]\n\nAlthough the show was canceled after its first season, it led to another show titled The Ben Stiller Show, on the Fox Network in 1992. The series aired 12 episodes on Fox, with a 13th unaired episode broadcast by Comedy Central in a later revival.[36] Among the principal writers on The Ben Stiller Show were Stiller and Judd Apatow, with the show featuring the ensemble cast of Stiller, Janeane Garofalo, Andy Dick, and Bob Odenkirk.[37] Both Denise Richards and Jeanne Tripplehorn appeared as extras in various episodes. Throughout its short run, The Ben Stiller Show frequently appeared at the bottom of the ratings, even as it garnered critical acclaim and eventually won an Emmy Award for ""Outstanding Writing in a Variety or Music Program"" posthumously.[36][38][39]\n\nDirectorial debut\n\nIn the early 1990s Stiller had minor roles in films such as Stella and Highway to Hell as well as a cameo in The Nutt House. In 1992 Stiller was approached to direct Reality Bites, based on a script by Helen Childress. Stiller devoted the next year and a half to rewriting the script with Childress, fundraising, and recruiting cast members for the film. It was eventually released in early 1994, directed by Stiller and featuring him as a co-star.[30] The film was produced by Danny DeVito, who would later direct Stiller\'s 2003 film Duplex and produce his 2004 film Along Came Polly.[40]\n\nReality Bites debuted as the highest-grossing film in its opening weekend and received mixed reviews.[41][42]\n\nStiller joined his parents in the family film Heavyweights (1995), in which he played two roles, and then had a brief uncredited role in Adam Sandler\'s Happy Gilmore (1996).[43][44] Next, he had lead roles in If Lucy Fell and Flirting with Disaster, before tackling his next directorial effort with The Cable Guy, which starred Jim Carrey. Stiller once again was featured in his own film, as twins. The film received mixed reviews, but was noted for paying the highest salary for an actor up to that point, as Carrey received $20 million for his work in the film.[45] The film also connected Stiller with future Frat Pack members Jack Black and Owen Wilson.[citation needed]\n\nAlso in 1996, MTV invited Stiller to host the VH1 Fashion Awards. Along with SNL writer Drake Sather, Stiller developed a short film for the awards about a male model known as Derek Zoolander. It was so well received that he developed another short film about the character for the 1997 VH1 Fashion Awards and finally remade the skit into a film.[30]\n\nComedic work\n\nStiller in 2010\n\nIn 1998 Stiller put aside his directing ambitions to star in a surprise hit with a long-lasting cult following, the Farrelly Brothers\' There\'s Something About Mary, alongside Cameron Diaz. That year, he starred in several dramas, including Zero Effect, Your Friends & Neighbors, and Permanent Midnight. He was invited to take part in hosting the Music Video awards, for which he developed a parody of the Backstreet Boys and performed a sketch with his father, commenting on his current career.[46]\n\nIn 1999 he starred in three films, including Mystery Men, where he played a superhero wannabe called Mr. Furious. He returned to directing with a new spoof television series for Fox titled Heat Vision and Jack, starring Jack Black; however, the show was not picked up by Fox after its pilot episode and the series was cancelled.[47]\n\nIn 2000, Stiller starred in three more films, including one of his most recognizable roles, a male nurse named Gaylord ""Greg"" Focker in Meet the Parents, opposite Robert De Niro.[48] The film was well received by critics, grossed over $330 million worldwide, and spawned two sequels.[49][50] Also in 2000, MTV again invited Stiller to make another short film, and he developed Mission: Improbable, a spoof of Tom Cruise\'s role in Mission: Impossible II and other films.[51]\n\nIn 2001, Stiller directed his third feature film, Zoolander, starring himself as Derek Zoolander. The film featured multiple cameos from a variety of celebrities, including Donald Trump, Paris Hilton, Lenny Kravitz, Heidi Klum, and David Bowie, among others. The film was banned in Malaysia (as the plot centered on an assassination attempt of a Malaysian prime minister),[52] while shots of the World Trade Center were digitally removed and hidden for the film\'s release after the September 11 terrorist attacks.[53]\n\nAfter Stiller worked with Owen Wilson in Zoolander, they joined together again for The Royal Tenenbaums.[54]\n\nOver the next two years, Stiller continued with the lackluster box office film Duplex, and cameos in Orange County and Nobody Knows Anything![55][56][57] He has guest-starred on several television shows, including an appearance in an episode of the television series The King of Queens in a flashback as the father of the character Arthur (played by Jerry Stiller).[58] He also made a guest appearance on World Wrestling Entertainment\'s WWE Raw.[59]\n\nIn 2004, Stiller appeared in six different films, all of which were comedies, and include some of his highest-grossing films: Starsky & Hutch, Envy, DodgeBall: A True Underdog Story, Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy (in which he had an uncredited cameo), Along Came Polly and Meet the Fockers. While the critical flop Envy only grossed $14.5 million,[60] the most successful film of these was Meet the Fockers, which grossed over $516.6 million worldwide.[61]\n\nHe also made extended guest appearances on Curb Your Enthusiasm and Arrested Development in the same year. In 2005, Stiller appeared in Madagascar, which was his first experience as a voice actor in an animated film. Madagascar was a massive worldwide hit, and spawned the sequels Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa in 2008 and Madagascar 3: Europe\'s Most Wanted in 2012.[62]\n\nIn 2006, Stiller had cameo roles in School for Scoundrels and Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny; he was executive producer of the latter. In December 2006, he had the lead role in Night at the Museum. Although not a critical favorite, it earned over $115 million in ten days.[63]\n\nIn 2007, Stiller starred alongside Malin \xc3\x85kerman in the romantic comedy The Heartbreak Kid. The film earned over $100 million worldwide despite receiving mostly negative reviews.[64][65]\n\nIn 2008, Stiller directed, co-wrote, co-produced, and starred in the film Tropic Thunder, with Robert Downey Jr. and Jack Black; Stiller had originally conceived of the film\'s premise while filming Empire of the Sun in 1987.[66]\n\nIn 2009, he starred with Amy Adams in Night at the Museum 2: Battle of the Smithsonian, sequel to Night at the Museum.[67]\n\nIn 2010, Stiller made a brief cameo in Joaquin Phoenix\'s mockumentary I\'m Still Here and played the lead role in the comedy-drama Greenberg. He again portrayed Greg Focker in the critically panned but financially successful Little Fockers, the second sequel to Meet the Parents. He had planned to voice the main character in Megamind, but later dropped out while still remaining a producer and voicing a minor character in the film.[68]\n\nIn 2011, Stiller starred with Eddie Murphy and Alan Alda in Tower Heist, about a group of maintenance workers planning a heist in a residential skyscraper.[69] He produced, directed, and starred in The Secret Life of Walter Mitty, which was released in 2013.[70]\n\nIn 2018 and 2019, Stiller played Michael Cohen on Saturday Night Live for 6 episodes.[citation needed]\n\n""Frat Pack""\n\nStiller has been described as the ""acknowledged leader"" of the Frat Pack, a core group of actors who have worked together in multiple films. The group includes Jack Black, Will Ferrell, Vince Vaughn, Owen Wilson, Luke Wilson, and Steve Carell.[71][72] Stiller has been acknowledged as the leader of the group because of his multiple cameos and for his consistent use of the other members in roles in films which he produces and directs. He has appeared the most with Owen Wilson (in 12 films).[71][73] Of the 35 primary films that are considered Frat Pack films, Stiller has been involved with 20, in some capacity.[71]\n\nStiller is also the only member of this group to have appeared in a Brat Pack film (Fresh Horses).[32] He rejects the ""Frat Pack"" label, saying in a 2008 interview that the concept was ""completely fabricated"".[74]\n\nPersonal life\n\nStiller dated several actresses during his early television and film career, including Jeanne Tripplehorn, Calista Flockhart, and Amanda Peet.[75][76] In May 2000, Stiller married actress Christine Taylor at an oceanfront ceremony in Kauai, Hawaii.[77] They met while filming a never-broadcast television pilot for the Fox Broadcasting network called Heat Vision and Jack. The couple appeared onscreen together in Zoolander, DodgeBall: A True Underdog Story, Tropic Thunder, Zoolander 2, Curb Your Enthusiasm, and Arrested Development.[78] The couple have two children. In May 2017, Stiller and Taylor announced their separation in a joint statement, after 17 years of marriage.[79]\n\nIn 2001, Stiller appeared as a celebrity contestant on the game show Who Wants to Be a Millionaire. He won $32,000 for his charity Project ALS, after incorrectly answering his $250,000 question in an attempt to equal Edie Falco\'s $250,000 win.[80]\n\nStiller is a supporter of the Democratic Party and donated money to John Kerry\'s 2004 U.S. Presidential campaign.[81] In February 2007, Stiller attended a fundraiser for Barack Obama and later donated to the 2008 U.S. Presidential campaigns of Democrats Obama, John Edwards, and Hillary Clinton.[82]\n\nStiller supports such charities as Declare Yourself, the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation, and the Starlight Starbright Children\'s Foundation.[83] Stiller is actively involved in support of animal rights.[84] In 2010, Stiller, together with Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Robin Williams, and others, starred in The Cove PSA: My Friend is... , in an effort to stop the slaughter of dolphins.[85] He was appointed Goodwill Ambassador for UNHCR on July 2, 2018.[86]\n\nStiller frequently impersonates such performers as Bono, Tom Cruise, Bruce Springsteen, and David Blaine. In an interview with Parade, he commented that Robert Klein, George Carlin, and Jimmie Walker were inspirations for his comedy career.[21] Stiller is also a self-professed Trekkie and appeared in the television special Star Trek: 30 Years and Beyond to express his love of the show, as well as a comedy roast for William Shatner.[87][88] He frequently references the show in his work, and named his production company Red Hour Productions after a time of day in the original Star Trek episode, ""The Return of the Archons"".[89]\n\nStiller was diagnosed with Lyme disease in 2010. He believes he contracted the illness while visiting Nantucket, Massachusetts.[90]\n\nStiller was diagnosed with prostate cancer in June 2014 and was declared cancer-free in September 2014 following the surgical removal of his prostate.[91][92][93]\n\nFilmography\n\nStiller has mostly appeared in comedy films. He is an Emmy Award winner for his directed, produced and written television show The Ben Stiller Show.[94]\n\nAwards and honors\n\nReferences'"

They just can\xe2\x80\x99t wait to start their life together.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe mag alleges that purchasing their first home together \xe2\x80\x9cis the beginning of what they hope will be a very long life together.\xe2\x80\x9d The source points out that the pair are completely different than they were back when their relationship wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the best. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ve both grown up so much. Being apart was crucial for them to move on and to realize they were meant to be together.\xe2\x80\x9d Ultimately, \xe2\x80\x9cbuying a home to live in as a couple will seal the deal.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAlthough Justin and Selena are clearly happy, as seen in photos from their most recent outing, not everyone is shipping the pair. Selena\xe2\x80\x99s family, who were there for her after the couple\xe2\x80\x99s 2015 split, are reportedly concerned for her well being. \xe2\x80\x9cThey want Selena to remain healthy,\xe2\x80\x9d the source says of her family\xe2\x80\x99s opinions. As you may know, Selena suffers from the auto immune disease lupus, and underwent a lifesaving kidney transplant over the summer. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, her family feels \xe2\x80\x9cthis could be the biggest mistake of her life.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nJelena shocked the world, and nearly broke the internet, when they reunited at her CA home in late October. However, the pair were not alone. They spent hours on end inside her home with mutual friends. Selena was still dating The Weeknd, 27, at the time of her reunion with the Biebs. However, the pair split just days after. What timing? \xe2\x80\xa6\n\nAnd, that first Jelena hangout was the start of many others to come. Justin and Selena have been inseparable ever since \xe2\x80\x94 Being photographed on sweet strolls through CA, riding bikes, out to romantic meals and attending church services. Interesting enough, we may have seen them together more times in the past few weeks than in their entire relationship\xe2\x80\xa6 and that began in 2009. So, you can infer that they\xe2\x80\x99ve been hanging out A LOT.\n\nThe couple or non-couple [they have yet to confirm], were most recently spotted out on a sweet stroll in LA on Nov. 13. A fan caught Jelena walking through what appeared to be a local park. Now, reports are claiming that Justin is patiently waiting for Sel to make him her boyfriend. Do you think she will?\n\nHollywoodLifers, how do you feel about Jelena\xe2\x80\x99s reunion?'"

Get the EXCLUSIVE details!\n\n\n\nPeople LOVE when couples rekindle their romances, but is a reunion in the cards for Kristen Stewart, 27, and Robert Pattinson, 31? The Twilight alums were spotted \xe2\x80\x9changing out\xe2\x80\x9d together on Feb. 11, and we\xe2\x80\x99re hearing that the former couple are on good terms now! \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s taken a long time to get there, but Rob and Kristen are finally friends again,\xe2\x80\x9d a source close to Rob told HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. \xe2\x80\x9cTheir break-up was so painful for Rob, and he felt so angry and humiliated by Kristen cheating, that at one point he doubted he would ever be able to fully forgive her. But, time heals and Rob\xe2\x80\x99s now managed to put the past behind him and let bygones be bygones.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut even though the pair have a past with each other, don\xe2\x80\x99t expect them them to be getting together in the future. \xe2\x80\x9cRob and Kristen have so much shared history, they were together during the craziest time in their lives, they pretty much grew up together during the whole Twilight madness, and they really understand each other better than anyone else could. Rob still has a lot of love and respect for Kristen, but it\xe2\x80\x99s evolved from romantic feelings into a deep friendship,\xe2\x80\x9d the insider added.\n\nIf you\xe2\x80\x99re bummed that Bella and Edward won\xe2\x80\x99t be living the rest of eternity together IRL, listen, I get it. We all are gunning for our faves to rekindle their lost love. Personally, I\xe2\x80\x99m still not over the fact that Vanessa Hudgens and Zac Efron broke up! But, unfortunately, not every couple is Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber. And also, Kristen herself has said in a monologue on Saturday Night Live that she is \xe2\x80\x9clike so gay dude.\xe2\x80\x9d She\xe2\x80\x99s currently dating Victoria\xe2\x80\x99s Secret model Stella Maxwell, 27. So yeah, Kristen and Robert aren\xe2\x80\x99t getting back together any time soon, and that\xe2\x80\x99s probably for the best. (And while we\xe2\x80\x99re at it, quit it with the Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston shipping! They\xe2\x80\x99re not getting back together! Stop it!)\n\nHollywoodLifers, what were your thoughts on Kristen and Robert hanging out?'"
"b'This Is Us creator Dan Fogelman was getting ready \xe2\x80\x94 brushing his teeth while listening to the nominations on his wife\'s cell phone \xe2\x80\x94 as he prepared to head back to work on episode two of the NBC drama\'s sophomore season when he learned of his show\'s multiple mentions. The time-jumping family drama scored 11 total nominations \xe2\x80\x94 including best drama series, the first time a broadcast series has cracked the category since 2011.\n\n""The emails are flying!"" Fogelman told THR early Thursday. ""We\'re so busy right now that there\'s not a lot of time to think \xe2\x80\xa6 the feed was freezing and we didn\'t quite understand what was happening. People were texting us ahead of us understanding what was going on!""\n\nFogelman noted that the way This Is Us is filmed \xe2\x80\x94 with members of the family working together in different scenes at any given time and not a lot of group scenes \xe2\x80\x94 will make getting the whole group together to celebrate complicated. ""There hasn\'t been a lot of planning! I need to figure out how to get everyone together in some way \xe2\x80\x94 I\'ve never done this before!"" the first-time nominee enthused. The busy producer was on his way to film on location Thursday and planned to find a way to head to the show\'s L.A. set to celebrate properly with the production.\n\nOne thing that wasn\'t lost on Fogelman: how challenging it is for programming that is both sentimental and heartfelt to cut through a cluttered landscape filled with dark dramas and anti-heroes. ""Normally if you have a sentiment in your show it\'s not in the same conversation as darker fare, and if you have sentiment and comedy? That\'s even more dangerous,"" he said, crediting stars including fellow nominees Milo Ventimiglia, Sterling K. Brown and Chrissy Metz, among others, for helping to elevate the content with serious performances. ""You actually feel like you\'re watching something more weighty than it may be because the actors are so good. That\'s why our show was able to cut through multiple conversations: it\'s popular and critical.""\n\nAs for what to expect when the 18-episode second season returns in the fall, Fogelman and company plan to lean deeper into the family\'s drama. ""The family has big stories this season. The first season laid out the logistics of the family and in the second season, we\'re able to dig deeper. We\'re doing heavy duty stuff to understand the separation between Chrissy and Mandy Moore\'s mother and daughter and why they feel so distant from each other. Each progressive season will be more intimate and explore more inside these relationships."" \xe2\x80\x94 Lesley Goldberg'"

The unemployed father of four was spotted having dinner at Trump Hotel\xe2\x80\x99s BLT Prime restaurant in Washington, DC just moments after being fired, reports Raw Story. But, he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t alone! Anthony was allegedly enjoying dinner with Katrina Pierson, 41, a political strategist who also appears as a contributor on CNN from time-to-time. Katrina is adamantly pro-Trump and was very briefly rumored to be replacing Anthony once he was fired, though she quickly took to Twitter to confirm that was definitely not going to happen.\n\nAccording to the Daily Mail, Anthony and Katrina were with a small group of people and they chose a corner table in hopes of being secluded from the public. Anthony and Katrina were seated directly next to each other, and eyewitnesses claim that Anthony spent almost the entire meal staring at his phone instead of eating. We\xe2\x80\x99re sure that he was upset about being fired, so this makes total sense. Though it\xe2\x80\x99s unclear what the relationship between Anthony and Katrina is, she also took to Twitter to defend his firing by revealing he was fired at 8am that day and managed to keep the news from leaking to the press.

If not, \xe2\x80\x9cWeekend Update: Summer Edition\xe2\x80\x9d is unlikely to seduce you. NBC\xe2\x80\x99s special edition of the faux newscast stretches the segment and adds a commercial break, which that means more than ever its success rests not on the momentum of the evening, the charisma of the host, or the enthusiasm of the studio audience but on the talents and chemistry of anchors Colin Jost and Michael Che. Those two are still grappling with a stilted awkwardness in their \xe2\x80\x9cWeekend Update\xe2\x80\x9d personas that make them both less engaging than they would otherwise be on their own. But as \xe2\x80\x9cSaturday Night Live\xe2\x80\x9d has enjoyed a resurgence in ratings and cultural relevancy, Jost\xe2\x80\x99s and Che\xe2\x80\x99s growing pains have smoothed out into a predictable dynamic.\n\nTonight\xe2\x80\x99s premiere of \xe2\x80\x9cWeekend Update: Summer Edition\xe2\x80\x9d had the advantage of a ton of Trump-related material to work with and several guest appearances: \xe2\x80\x9cSNL\xe2\x80\x9d cast member Leslie Jones, featured cast members Mikey Day and Alex Moffat, and alum Bill Hader (in a committed impression as Anthony Scaramucci). Jost\xe2\x80\x99s biggest laugh \xe2\x80\x94 one punctuated with gasps and groans \xe2\x80\x94 came from a remark about how even President Franklin Roosevelt knew when to stand up. Che, meanwhile, found his sweet spot in the midst of a long analogy about how the Statue of Liberty had gotten \xe2\x80\x9cbougie\xe2\x80\x9d lately, which ended with his exclamation: \xe2\x80\x9cBitch, you ain\xe2\x80\x99t China!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nStill, with the news being what it is \xe2\x80\x94 and with so many other shows in the satirical news space \xe2\x80\x94 the humor didn\xe2\x80\x99t quite match up to the material. During the regular season, \xe2\x80\x9cWeekend Update\xe2\x80\x9d gets a handicap precisely because it is buried in the middle of a 90-minute live sketch show with just one week to throw everything together. On its own, the premiere of the summer edition was a reminder of how sharp and hilarious the political satire game can be elsewhere.\n\nWhere \xe2\x80\x9cWeekend Update\xe2\x80\x9d can stand out is in its commitment to things that aren\xe2\x80\x99t funny-ish one-liners based on headlines. That\xe2\x80\x99s why Jones\xe2\x80\x99 appearances as a randomly horny version of herself are always so welcome. Oddly, the best joke of the night was Moffat as Eric Trump, aah-ing over a fidget spinner, maybe because it barely had to be written at all: Moffat just stared at it, while Day (as Donald Jr.) spun it for him.\n\nWith the threat of nuclear war in the headlines, it\xe2\x80\x99s nice that \xe2\x80\x9cWeekend Update\xe2\x80\x9d is around for the summer to add a little more levity to a news cycle that is full of fire and fury.

"b'The public has been somewhat aware of the Jamie Foxx and Katie Holmes romantic link for a little while now. Though we\'ve seen them spending time together, the pair hasn\'t offered any obvious public displays of affection until now.\n\nFoxx and Holmes were spotted having a romantic time at the beach. Onlookers watched them wrestle in the sand and share a bottle of champagne in between make-out sessions. One of the beachgoers dished about how happy they seemed:\n\n""They were totally engaged with each other. They were never on their phones. She had this incredible smile on her face. She looked smitten.""\n\nSources close to Holmes have commented on the lovers\' connection.

""He was a good friend to me,"" Gosling told Ellen Degeneres during the sit-down. ""There was something about George where he always\xe2\x80\x94I think he felt being a dog was beneath him.

"b'On April 12, 2018, Khloe Kardashian and Tristan Thompson welcomed their first child together.\n\nHowever, while Khloe was awaiting the birth of True Thompson in Cleveland, Ohio, reports began swirling that her boyfriend was photographed ""getting up close and personal with a mystery brunette"" in New York City.\n\nFrom there, videos and photos cascaded from sites like The Shade Room and TMZ that claimed to show the NBA player cheating with multiple women. Khloe later confirmed these reports and forgave Thompson \xe2\x80\x94 but nearly one year later, the couple was hit with yet another scandal.\n\nIf you\'ve been following the couple\'s tumultuous relationship, you\'ll know that Thompson\'s reputation has been hazy from the get-go. Here\'s the full timeline of his reported infidelity.\n\nThompson and Khloe began dating while his girlfriend of two years, model and blogger Jordan Craig, was pregnant\n\nThompson and Craig were together for about two years starting in 2014, though it\'s unclear when they broke up. Thompson reportedly began dating Khloe in the summer of 2016 after a successful blind date.\n\nIn court documents obtained by Radar Online, Craig said that she found out one month into her pregnancy that Thompson was cheating on her.\n\nCraig reportedly said that she confronted Thompson about it but he denied everything. She said her suspicions were confirmed when she saw paparazzi photos of him and Kardashian together, according to the documents.\n\nGoing to miss my bump..but the best is yet to come! \xf0\x9f\x98\xac\xf0\x9f\xa4\x97 Vest: @AzurraDubai A post shared by \xf0\x9f\x8f\x86\xe2\x84\x90\xe2\x84\xb4 \xe2\x84\x9b\xc4\x91\xc6\xb4.\xe2\x84\xad\xf0\x9f\x8f\x86 (@alleyesonjordyc) on Nov 30, 2016 at 4:21pm PST Nov 30, 2016 at 4:21pm PST\n\nThompson and Khloe stepped out as a couple in September 2016 and even went on vacation together. Craig was six months pregnant at the time.\n\nRead more: Khloe Kardashian says she didn\'t know Tristan Thompson was in a relationship with Jordan Craig when they started dating\n\n""When Khloe first started dating Tristan, her family questioned if it was a good idea. There were several concerns, including that he is another basketball player and also that his ex was pregnant,"" an unnamed source told People. ""It took a while for the family to accept Tristan. They were worried that Khloe would end up heartbroken.""\n\nShortly after Thompson and Khloe went public with their relationship, sources claimed that he was a cheater with an existing \'side chick\'\n\nBET reported that, in addition to his history with Craig, Thompson was still seeing another woman.\n\nThe website cited a source who claimed that Thompson and Craig broke up because of his ""cheating ways.""\n\nBossip, however, claimed that Thompson and Craig were ""very much still an item"" when he was initially filmed kissing Khloe on Snapchat.\n\nSources also told OK! magazine that Khloe\'s friends were concerned about her ""dating patterns"" and her new beau\'s intentions.\n\n#MemoriesWithYou\xf0\x9f\x92\x95 A post shared by \xf0\x9f\x8f\x86\xe2\x84\x90\xe2\x84\xb4 \xe2\x84\x9b\xc4\x91\xc6\xb4.\xe2\x84\xad\xf0\x9f\x8f\x86 (@alleyesonjordyc) on Dec 12, 2017 at 4:01pm PST Dec 12, 2017 at 4:01pm PST\n\nCraig gave birth to a son, Prince, in December of 2016. She apparently did not list Thompson as the father on Prince\'s birth certificate. According to TMZ, the baby\'s father must be present at the hospital for his name to appear on the initial birth certificate, though his name can be added after. Prince\'s last name was still listed as Thompson.\n\nKhloe has never publicly acknowledged the birth of her boyfriend\'s first child. And while the new father did not acknowledge the birth on social media, he did post a photo of himself and Khloe together on Christmas, two weeks later.\n\n""Merry Christmas & Happy Holidays from me and mines, to you and yours,"" he wrote.\n\nMerry Christmas & Happy Holidays from me and mines, to you and yours. A post shared by Tristan Thompson (@realtristan13) on Dec 25, 2016 at 6:24pm PST Dec 25, 2016 at 6:24pm PST\n\nAbout two weeks after news broke that Khloe and Thompson were expecting their first child together, Thompson was filmed with another women\n\nJust before the birth of True Thompson, TMZ published a surveillance video that was reportedly taken back in October \xe2\x80\x94 when Khloe was three months pregnant \xe2\x80\x94 of Thompson appearing to cheat on her with two women at a hookah lounge outside Washington, DC.\n\nThe video was recorded on October 7, 2017, the night before Thompson and the Cleveland Cavaliers played the Washington Wizards.\n\nWhile it\'s unclear why the footage surfaced months later, the couple was almost certainly aware of Khloe\'s pregnancy when the cheating reportedly took place. Although the couple had yet to confirm the pregnancy publicly, as The Cut writer and ""Keeping Up With the Kardashians"" expert Mariah Smith noted, they likely filmed her pregnancy announcement to the family on August 25, 2017.\n\nOnce Kardashian confirmed her pregnancy in December 2017, Twitter was aflame with the allegation that Thompson had cheated on his pregnant ex with Khloe\n\nAlthough the rumor had obviously been floating around social media for months, it didn\'t seem to gain much traction until Khloe\'s pregnancy was confirmed.\n\n""OK but he cheated on his pregnant ex with u so what makes u think he won\'t do the same now,"" one commenter wrote on her announcement post.\n\nTwitter user @rosechocglam also expressed disdain that Thompson had rarely \xe2\x80\x94 if ever \xe2\x80\x94 acknowledged his son Prince on social media, ""but was happy to pose for a pregnancy announcement with Khloe.""\n\nAt the time, an unnamed source told Hollywood Life that Craig didn\'t want to be seen as a ""poor victimized woman.""\n\n""Jordan and Tristan had split already when he met Khloe, so he didn\'t desert her at all, and they\'re actually pretty good friends still, all things considered,"" the source told the site.\n\nOn Tuesday, April 10, nearing Khloe\'s due date, photos and videos surfaced of Thompson with another woman in New York City\n\nThe Daily Mail reported that Thompson was seen kissing an unidentified woman at PH-D Lounge in New York City on Saturday, April 7.\n\nThe supposed encounter was caught on video, which the Daily Mail published. The unnamed woman who filmed it told the site, ""I was there and he was on the table right next to us with a group of friends and one girl who he was obviously making out with all night.""\n\nPage Six later identified the woman as 28-year-old model Lani Blair and reported that the two spent four hours together at the Cleveland Cavaliers\' hotel (who were in the city to play the New York Knicks on Monday night). The pair was then photographed on their way to Soho House and again back at the hotel at 5 a.m. on Sunday.\n\nRead more: People think Khloe Kardashian knew about Tristan Thompson\'s alleged cheating for months \xe2\x80\x94 and it proves how powerful the Kardashians really are\n\nMeanwhile, the ""Revenge Body"" creator had been nesting in Cleveland as she awaited the arrival of their daughter.\n\nWe are ready whenever you are little mama \xf0\x9f\xa6\x8b A post shared by Khlo\xc3\xa9 (@khloekardashian) on Apr 9, 2018 at 6:24am PDT Apr 9, 2018 at 6:24am PDT\n\n""Tristan has been consistently cheating on Khloe. He\'s a serial cheater. And there will be more women to come out of the woodwork,"" a source told People. ""[Family and friends] are heartbroken for Khloe. They didn\'t realize how deceptive Tristan could really be.""\n\nThompson\'s ex reacted to the news on social media shortly after reports of his infidelity broke\n\nWhile fans flooded Craig\'s social media with comments like ""you won"" and ""Karma\'s a b----,"" she seemingly took the high road with a message on her Instagram story.\n\n""If you respect yourself and you respect others, you would never make light of the misfortune of anyone, nor would you feel indemnified when it comes at the expense of others,"" Craig wrote. ""Wishing peace for everyone.""\n\nAlthough Craig did not mention Thompson by name, many interpreted this post as a response to the news. @alleyesonjordyc/Instagram\n\nOther people close to Thompson were apparently less than shocked about the news.\n\n""None of his friends are surprised by this and they all know he cheats,"" one source told Us Weekly. ""Most of his friends and people in his circle also cheat and don\'t think there\'s anything wrong with it.""\n\nDespite the cheating reports, Thompson was with Khloe for the birth of their daughter\n\nIt was reported that Thompson was with Khloe for the birth of their child, which was later confirmed on an episode of ""Keeping Up With the Kardashians.""\n\nRead more: Khloe Kardashian explained why she let Tristan Thompson in the delivery room just days after reports that he cheated on her\n\nHer best friend Malika Haqq, mom Kris Jenner, and sisters Kim Kardashian West and Kourtney Kardashian were also by her side.\n\nKris, Kourtney, and Kim all flew to Cleveland to support Khloe. Thompson can be seen in the back. @khloekardashian/Instagram\n\n""KUWTK"" fans later discovered that Khloe\'s family members were apparently shocked and ""disgusted"" when allegations of Thompson\'s indiscretions first surfaced.\n\nKhloe revealed that their daughter is still taking Thompson\'s last name\n\nIn her first Instagram post since the cheating reports, the new mom announced that she named her baby girl True Thompson.\n\n""Our little girl, True Thompson, has completely stolen our hearts and we are overwhelmed with LOVE,"" Khloe wrote.

News that Khloe still hoped to salvage the relationship for the sake of their daughter.\n\n""She has one foot out the door but is also holding on to the fact that her and Tristan can make it work,"" the source told the site. ""She hasn\'t given up on him yet, but also hasn\'t really been focusing on their relationship. When they see each other, it is all about the baby and parenting together. Khloe has fallen in love with him all over again, watching him be a dad to True, but [she also] knows she needs to really take a step back and make the right decision.""\n\nDespite initial reports that she was preparing to move back to Los Angeles as soon as possible, Khloe remained in Cleveland, which is Thompson\'s home base.\n\nKim Kardashian West seemingly confirmed the allegations during an interview with Ellen DeGeneres\n\nIn an interview that aired in full on Monday, April 30, DeGeneres asked Kardashian West what she thought about ""poor Khloe.""\n\n""I think everybody was heartbroken for her. I mean, literally days before she gives birth, her boyfriend is seen on video cheating. And, uh, you have opinions about that?"" DeGeneres asked.\n\n""Like, I don\'t even know how to describe it besides it\'s just so f----d up,""Kardashian West told her, seemingly confirming the reports. ""We really were rooting for Khloe, and we still are ... you know, she\'s so strong and she\'s doing the best that she can. It\'s a really sad situation all over.""\n\nDespite her vagueness, this was a stunning admission from the woman who would rather drink a sardine smoothie than address rumors about her sisters. Kardashian West has insisted on multiple occasions that, especially when there are kids involved, the family prefers not to comment publicly on relatives or significant others.\n\n""I\'m gonna keep it cute and keep it classy and not talk too bad \xe2\x80\x94 I\'m gonna try not to say anything so negative \'cause one day, True is gonna see this,"" she told DeGeneres, but went on to reiterate that the situation is ""just so messed up.""\n\nKris Jenner called the cheating scandal \'unexpected\'\n\nThe momager also appeared on ""The Ellen DeGeneres Show"" soon after True\'s birth. Although she was slightly more reserved than Kardashian West, she didn\'t shy away from addressing the ""unexpected"" scandal and Khloe\'s adjustment to motherhood.\n\n""It\'s your daughter and she\'s about to have a baby,"" DeGeneres said. ""Then that video comes out of him ... you must have been furious.""\n\n""I\'m there to support my kids no matter what happens,"" Jenner said. ""I just do the best I can, just like anybody else would for their family ... we\'re a force to be reckoned with.\n\n""Khloe is amazing. I\'m so proud of that kid. I get choked up because she\'s such a good mom and honestly I get so emotional. She\'s just concentrating on that, just being a mom, her baby, and I think that\'s what her sisters are doing as well. She\'s so excited about motherhood.""\n\nKhloe and Thompson remained a couple\n\nLess than a month after True\'s birth, the embattled couple was spotted out and about in Cleveland.\n\nAccording to TMZ, Khloe appeared to be ""relaxed and smiling"" during lunch with Thompson and a group friends at TownHall in Cleveland. A representative from TownHall confirmed to INSIDER that the two were dining at the restaurant.\n\nAn anonymous source told Us Weekly that the pair were ""fully back together.""\n\nThree days later, TMZ published a photo of Khloe at a Cleveland Cavaliers game Saturday night as further evidence that their relationship is still going strong. The opposing team even chanted her name while Thompson was shooting free throws.\n\n\xe2\x80\x94Dime on UPROXX (@DimeUPROXX) May 2, 2018\n\nKhloe finally spoke out about criticism of her decision to stay with Thompson\n\nAlthough Khloe had posted a number of cryptic quotes and messages since the birth of her daughter, none were explicitly commenting on her relationship with Thompson \xe2\x80\x94 until she responded directly to a fan who called her a ""hypocrite"" for staying with him.\n\nRead more: Kourtney Kardashian says she also would have stayed with Tristan Thompson after his reported cheating scandal\n\n""You have no knowledge of what goes on in our household or the enormous rebuilding this takes to even coexist,"" Khloe responded. ""I\'m proud of my strength. I appreciate your opinion and I hope you hold that same opinion to everyone else who has stayed in situations.""\n\nThe fan claimed that she just feels ""protective"" of Khloe and that she doesn\'t want ""some lame breaking [her] heart again.""\n\n""I love you for that and girl trust me don\'t I understand!!! I appreciate you,"" Khloe replied.\n\nThe new mom also hit back at a headline from the Daily Mail, which suggested that a recent dinner with Thompson was ""VERY tense.""\n\n""You make up anything!! I actually had a great night,"" she wrote on Twitter. ""It was a large birthday dinner for friends and as a new mom IM TIRED AF!! Being out past 10pm is not where I\'ll have the most energy these days.""\n\nKhloe has since directly addressed her boyfriend\'s alleged infidelity\n\nIn September, Khloe \xe2\x80\x94 whilst spending time with Thompson and True for their first ever ""family vacay"" \xe2\x80\x94 also spent some time replying to reports and critical comments on Instagram.\n\nAfter a source told Us Weekly the two were discussing an engagement, Khloe called the report ""crap"" and ""ridiculous."" Shortly after, she replied to a commenter on Instagram who accused her of ""acting like Tristan didn\'t cheat.""\n\nA screenshot of Khloe Kardashian\'s comment on a @commentsbyceleb post. @commentsbycelebs/Instagram\n\n""I\'m not acting as if Tristan didn\'t cheat.

Her mom was her rock when she was having her health complications.\'\n\nHowever, People magazine\'s sources have refuted these claims.\n\n\'They have their own issues and are always on and off.

She knows she doesn\'t need him.\'\n\nInfidelity\n\nA rumor is swirling among Justin and Selena fans on Twitter that Justin was unfaithful to Selena.

Especially considering it appears Petra is spending time with newly-single Justin Theroux.\n\nThey didn\'t break up\n\nWhile many outlets are reporting that Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber have definitely decided to take some time apart, others claim they\'re still going strong.\n\nEntertainment Tonight maintains the duo are still dating, but that Selena is taking a little time for herself to avoid outside pressure that stems from all the attention the two get.\n\nA source said: \'Selena is very delicate; her ""comeback"" to the spotlight has been tough \xe2\x80\x94 especially with the interest in her personal life with Justin and her mother.\n\nSelena Gomez and Justin Bieber spotted leaving the Saban Theatre in Beverly Hills, California together despite breakup rumors. pic.twitter.com/Ey7aHofjbT \xe2\x80\x94 Pop Crave (@PopCrave) March 8, 2018\n\n\'She is taking time to herself.

Some tweeters seem to think the couple simply don\'t like the media circus surrounding their relationship, so they\'re laying low.\n\nThis theory does seemingly hold up, as both Justin and Selena have complained about paparazzi attention in the past.\n\nWill Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber get back together?\n\nA recent report from People magazine suggests that reconciliation is imminent for Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber. Their sources say fans should expect to see that sooner, rather than later.\n\n\'They\'ve been having disagreements, but it wouldn\'t be surprising if they\'re back together in a week,\' the Jelena insider said.\n\nSimilarly, E! reported that this is \'likely not the end\' for Selena and Justin.\n\nSelena Gomez will be 75 years old and still on again/off again with Justin Bieber.

"b'The 4:44 Tour\n\nJay-Z, Vic Mensa\n\nToyota Center\n\nNovember 8, 2017\n\nExpecting Jay-Z to be defiant, even at 47 is akin to asking a known superstar to go out and score 30 on a given night. It\'s what Jay-Z does. It\'s what he has done for the better part of two decades, both on stage and in music.\n\nThe 4:44 Tour, his latest North American light jog through the classics offers, maybe for the first time, a bit of bite and added emphasis to prove something to the world. There have been numerous reports of the tour not selling out, that it isn\'t meeting expectations or worse, is an abject failure solely because you can find a few decent seats on Groupon or a third-party reseller. None of those issues came into Toyota Center on Wednesday night. Well, there was the moment where Hov caught a glimpse of a man who brought his dog to the concert, but we need to build up to that moment first.\n\nJay-Z performed 29 songs on Wednesday, which allowed for 29 different thoughts to run through my head at any given moment. Instead of fully recapping how Jay-Z, one of music\'s interesting yet straightforward best live performers managed to captivate an audience for damn near two hours, I\'ll jog through 15 separate thoughts I had during the set.\n\nTHOUGHT ONE: Jay-Z really can\'t grow a proper mustache. There\'s a rule in life that you can\'t trust anyone who can\'t grow facial hair, and somehow Jay-Z fits that bill and yet he doesn\'t. Somebody trusted Jay-Z with 92 bricks, and he lost them, but somehow he didn\'t die of it which makes him close to immortal. Or a Highlander.\n\nTHOUGHT TWO: ""Kill Jay-Z"" is a perfect tone-setter for this show. One, because four revolving boards are showing old Jay-Z videos and each of the still frames are getting set on fire. All of the doom and gloom, breaking up with Kanye, loving Blue and Beyonce plays out on these boards. FYI, he still loves Kanye to death and if I were a betting man, ""Otis"" and ""Runaway"" are Jay-Z\'s two favorite Kanye West videos.\n\nTHOUGHT THREE: LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers showed up, ahead of their scheduled matchup with the Rockets on Thursday. Does Jay go harder when LeBron\'s in attendance? Cause he went super hard on stage, almost as if he were still dissing Deshawn Stevenson and Soulja Boy on behalf of the NBA\'s best player.\n\nTHOUGHT FOUR: Yes, that was a thing that happened in 2007. Jay-Z is as petty as I am when it comes to friends and that makes him a super best friend unless you cross him.\n\nTHOUGHT FIVE: Is it customary that when you go to a Jay-Z show, you have to wear a Yankees fitted? Or that you have to break out your Timbaland boots? Scratch that, when the weather gets anywhere near 59 degrees in Houston, those Timbs are coming out.\n\nTHOUGHT SIX: Jay-Z has maybe three distinct national anthem style records. Those are the significant arena records that are gritty as hell and separate real Jay-Z fans from the guys who latched on with ""Empire State of Mind."" ""PSA"" from 2003\'s The Black Album? A definite national anthem. ""U Don\'t Know"" from 2001\'s The Blueprint? A full-on national anthem with a simple refrain: ""I will not lose, ever."" The third is ""Run This Town"" from 2009\'s The Blueprint 3. The build-up to that song immediately makes you believe you could take on Andre The Giant with your bare hands and survive. All three were performed, almost in near succession to one another.\n\nTHOUGHT SEVEN: When Jay-Z feels like really getting excited, he makes sure the crowd lights are blood red. You know he\'s performing the entire song when the lights go red.\n\nTHOUGHT EIGHT: Thank God he cut ""Forever Young"" out of this setlist. It\'s a cheesy closer. ""Numb / Encore"" in honor of the late Chester Bennington? A perfect closer. Never go ""Forever Young.""\n\nTHOUGHT NINE: Hearing ""Allure,"" his goodbye to the drug game song from The Black Album mixed in with a verse from ""Dead Presidents II,"" one of his favorite hustler records is a top 5 Jay-Z concert moment for me, and I don\'t care who says otherwise. Fight the guy who messed over your chopped cheese sandwich.\n\nTHOUGHT TEN: There are zero guests for the 4:44 Tour. It\'s mostly Jay-Z, in a one-person show getting a lot of feelings off his chest. Even the cues where you\'d think a guest would show up like Bun B for ""Big Pimpin"" or Beyonc\xc3\xa9 just to send people on a higher level for ""Family Feud"" were absent. It was a man, on a self-created mountain, performing with a band underneath him.\n\nTHOUGHT ELEVEN: ""4:44"" as a song is a demonstrative exercise. There\'s so much to unpack it outside of Jay admitting that he cheated and that he cannot perform the song while directly looking at the audience. The same guy who wrote songs about shooting his brother, selling drugs to his friends and leaving condoms in the baby seat of the mother that once dated his most significant rival (Nas) is scared to look a crowd in the eye and admitted he messed up. It\'s riveting theater.\n\nTHOUGHT TWELVE: You can\'t go to a Jay-Z show and not break out rap hands. It\'s an ordained right from watching Jay-Z perform for over 20 years. You know the mannerisms, you know how it\'s going to go, and you especially do that when it\'s time for your moment with your song, you\'re going to let out a roar and try to emulate the guy on stage. The biggest fear, however, with a Jay-Z show in 2017 is that you can apparently figure out who is a diehard Hov stan since 1996 and who caught on real late and is picky about their Jay-Z fandom. Don\'t trust people who are picky about their Jay-Z fandom. Don\'t believe the people who tug at their jackets a bit tight when you\'re rapping ""Where I\'m From"" or ""Lucifer"" or the Hov deep cuts. Don\'t trust people who think that "".38 revolve like the sun around the Earth"" line from ""It\'s Hot"" is fantastic. Why? Because a real Jay-Z fan will tell you that line was terrible, that\'s why.\n\nTHOUGHT THIRTEEN: Right before ""99 Problems,"" Jay-Z singled out a guy who decided to make history. Jay-Z has seen plenty of shows and tours in his life. He\'s never seen someone bring a dog, without headphones (!) to a concert of his. ""I want to see him recognized and shouted out for his dedication,"" Hov said. No one decided to ask why the man brought his dog, or how he even got the dog past Toyota Center security. We just know the dog, and the man were there. About as random as the man who dressed in full Astros regalia at the parade crowd surfing.\n\nTHOUGHT FOURTEEN: A catalog as dense as Jay\'s would lead to a few questionable moments on the setlist. Somehow, he spread out the list to touch nearly every era of his career. There were Black Album cuts I thought he would never perform live again (""Allure""). There was even an emphasis on some of his Magna Carta Holy Grail work with ""Beach Is Better,"" though I\'m sure it was tossed in there for the Beyonc\xc3\xa9 line alone, this being Houston after all. The one weird quirk? ""99 Problems"" was the only song that had closed-captioned for the hearing impaired. Did Jay-Z individually do this because he wanted everyone in the audience to get his point? Did he do this specifically for the guy who brought his dog? We need answers.\n\nTHOUGHT FIFTEEN: Meek Mill is on Jay-Z\'s mind. Tuesday night in Dallas, he spoke out about the Philadelphia rapper\'s latest incarceration due to riding a dirt bike in New York City. The judge considered it a probation violation since riding dirt bikes in NYC is illegal and sentenced Meek to serve two to four years in state prison in Pennsylvania. ""He\'s been on probation for 11 years,"" Hov said to the shock of the crowd. ""If that ain\'t modern day slavery and fuckery, I don\'t know what is. I\'m not talking about a black and white issue; I\'m talking about a human issue."" Human issues are paramount these days, and with Hov, every problem becomes more considerable to speak on. The prison-industrial complex, mental health, therapy? All of it is big. Jay-Z is like Ric Flair in that way. On stage and in front of a camera? He\'s Jay-Z. When he\'s off it? He\'s Shawn Carter, still trying to navigate these spaces where Jay-Z would be comfortable.\n\nIt\'s a Comfy Hov world now.\n\nSO HOW ABOUT THE OPENER: When I spoke to Vic Mensa ahead of this show, he told me that performing a record like ""We Could Be Free"" made him get lost in the lyrics and the message. As he prepared himself to kick off the 4:44 Tour, he kept that word in mind.\n\nMensa\'s set uses that same circular stage that Jay-Z\'s does but the Chicago rapper condenses his movement far more than Hov does. Songs like ""16 Shots"" get reflective lights and Mensa clutching a mike stand as if the drums and bass are hitting him dead in the chest. In other moments, such as ""OMG,"" he stands at attention, and for a twist, he put Paul Wall\'s ""Sittin Sidewayz"" and UGK and OutKast\'s ""International Players Anthem"" underneath him to make him lift higher.\n\nClad in a jacket that was half-denim, half tribute to Michael Jackson\'s ""Rock With You"" video, Mensa used up a solid 30 minutes to tell his story. There were the three sides to a story narrative of ""Heaven On Earth,"" where he discussed his friend getting killed through his eyes, the eyes of his killer and the eyes of his friend wishing him success. He discussed losing love with ""Homewrecker"" and made sure to dedicate ""We Could Be Free"" to those who lost their lives to police violence and also to the 26 men, women and children who lost their lives in Sutherland Springs last Sunday. Everything was on Mensa\'s mind on Wednesday, and in a controlled fury, all of his thoughts spilled out. For a kicker? Malik Yusef, the Chicago poet, decided to go all-in on a poem celebrating Houston\'s triumph through the pain following Hurricane Harvey and the Astros winning the World Series.\n\nBefore Toyota Center became a home game for Jay-Z, it felt like a home away from home for Vic Mensa too.\n\nPERSONAL BIAS: Jay-Z has learned from Kanye in how to make a stage design a big damn deal in a one-man rap show.\n\nTHE CROWD: There are your reformed dope boys who took their ladies out. There were the women who didn\'t mind the cold to show off and show out. There were Astros jerseys and hats everywhere, the city still awash in the pride of a championship touching this city\'s lips for the first time in two decades. It was half-date night, half-stunt night in Toyota Center. Which is probably the only way a Jay-Z concert in 2017 can go.\n\nLocal\n\nCommunity\n\nJournalism\n\nI Support Support the independent voice of Houston and help keep the future of Houston Press free. Support Us\n\nOVERHEARD IN THE CROWD: ""I thought you didn\'t like the Yankees!""\n\nRANDOM NOTEBOOK DUMP: Moments after the show ended and the drive home began, I realized that all of the talks about the tour being a failure due to it not being as in-demand a show was bull. There\'s no way you can have a bad show with your favorite artist unless that artist is late as hell or skips out with plenty of time left on the clock. Jay-Z could have gone until 1 performing the hits and nobody would have minded.

He continued his comedic roles in the 2010s with The Dilemma (2011), The Watch (2012), and The Internship (2013).

His father, Vernon Lindsay Vaughn, worked as a salesman for a toy company.[5] As a child, he was raised both Protestant and Catholic by his Catholic mother and Protestant father.[6][7] He has Lebanese, Italian, Irish, English, and German ancestry.[8]\n\nVaughn grew up in Buffalo Grove, Illinois, where he played football and baseball and wrestled, although he has called himself ""unathletic"" and ""very average"" at high school sports.[9] He then moved to Lake Forest, where he graduated from Lake Forest High School in 1988. He was introduced to musical theater at a young age and decided to become an actor in 1987. He has credited his mother as the inspiration behind his career, saying that ""I saw her overcome stuff, and I thought if you worked hard at something you\'d give yourself a chance"".[10]\n\nCareer\n\nVaughn in 2006\n\nIn 1988, Vaughn was cast in a Chevrolet television commercial and subsequently moved to Hollywood. He appeared in the 1989 season of the television series China Beach and in three CBS Schoolbreak Specials in 1990.

Two years later, he was cast in a lead role in a proposed revival of 77 Sunset Strip that was to air on the fledgling WB Television Network, but the project ceased development after initial testing. Vaughn did not receive wider success until his role in 1996\'s Swingers with Jon Favreau. Swingers was released in July 1996 and became a successful independent film. Vince\'s father Vernon also did a cameo in this film.\n\nAfterwards, director Steven Spielberg cast Vaughn in the blockbuster The Lost World: Jurassic Park which gave him increased exposure.

Vaughn also appeared in Dwight Yoakam\'s directorial debut movie South of Heaven, West of Hell. Vaughn\'s role in the successful 2003 comedy Old School skyrocketed his popularity.\n\nIn 2004, Vaughn appeared alongside Ben Stiller in the hit films Starsky & Hutch and Dodgeball. After this series of roles, Vaughn was dubbed one of the Hollywood ""Frat Pack"", a group of actors who frequently co-star in film comedies.

He also starred in the second season of True Detective alongside Colin Farrell, which premiered on June 21. In 2016, he starred in the crime thriller Term Life, which featured friend and frequent collaborator Jon Favreau in a supporting role and was directed by another frequent collaborator, Peter Billingsley.[16]\n\nIn 2018, Vaughn co-starred alongside Mel Gibson in Dragged Across Concrete, his second collaboration with S.

In 2020, he starred with Kathryn Newton in the well-reviewed horror-comedy film Freaky, in which they play a serial killer and a teenage girl, respectively, who switch bodies.\n\nPersonal life\n\nIn 2005, Vaughn began dating Jennifer Aniston, his co-star in The Break-Up.[17] In late 2006, Vaughn filed a lawsuit against three tabloid magazines accusing them of falsely claiming that he had been unfaithful to Aniston.[18] They broke up in November 2006.[17]\n\nIn March 2009, it was reported that Vaughn was engaged to Canadian realtor Kyla Weber.[19] They married on January 2, 2010,[20] in the historic Armour House at Lake Forest Academy in Lake Forest, Illinois.

"b""Is morning television on the brink of a major change? NBC chairman Andy Lack just signed Megyn Kelly to a major deal, and now the New York Post reports that there are rumors at the Peacock Network that the former Fox News star could take over for Savannah Guthrie on the Today show.\n\nThough Kelly had taken pitches from ABC and CNN after leaving FOX, the promise of a daytime slot and a Sunday night show at NBC was too much for her to pass up. However, there may not be much to the Today rumors \xe2\x80\x94 NBC insists that Guthrie, who is currently on maternity leave and recently signed a five-year deal with Today, isn\xe2\x80\x99t going anywhere.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe just signed Savannah to a massive deal that is longer than Megyn\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x9d a high-level NBC source told Page Six. \xe2\x80\x9cA lead anchor role at Today isn\xe2\x80\x99t part of the conversation for Megyn.

It is being discussed.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIt was rumored that Kelly was in deep talks with ABC to replace Robin Roberts on Good Morning America, though network officials have denied any such reports.\n\nKelly, who was FOX\xe2\x80\x99s No. 2 anchor for some time behind Bill O\xe2\x80\x99Reilly, announced earlier this month that she would be leaving the network for NBC News. Her decision comes after Greta Van Susteren also departed FOX last fall in favor of MSNBC, leaving the network without its top two female anchors.

President-elect Trump\xe2\x80\x99s attacks on her during the election cycle helped raise her profile even more. However, a possible Today gig is a far different animal than the 9 p.m. slot Kelly is used to, with audiences typically favoring entertainment stories and lighter subject matter as opposed to her traditional hard news.\n\nWill Carlson, who has had an up-and-down career in front of the cameras, be an effective replacement at FOX?

Instead, they appear on a screen and the hosts do the matchmaking for them.\n\nIf you don\xe2\x80\x99t know what that show is, then chances are you\xe2\x80\x99re not alone on the couch at 11pm eating those tubs of ice cream while watching late night SBS.\n\nOf all the contenders, Vonn was most enthusiastic about Black Panther star Michael B. Jordan. The pair share the same stylist, and Vonn is hoping to use him to set up a first date.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s very cute,\xe2\x80\x9d Vonn said. \xe2\x80\x9cMy stylist \xe2\x80\x94 he\xe2\x80\x99s trying to facilitate (dinner).

Larry Busacca/Getty Images The INSIDER Summary:\n\nKanye West fans are convinced Taylor Swift\'s album release date purposely coincides with the 10th anniversary of Kanye West\'s mother\'s death.\n\nIn response to the date, Kanye fans took to the r/Kanye subreddit to plan ""Hey Mama"" day.\n\nThe plan is to repeatedly stream a singular Kanye song on that date in order to steal the potential top spot from Swift.\n\nAround 2,200 fans have declared interest in the event so far.\n\n\n\nTaylor Swift has done everything she can to rattle cages with her new single, ""Look What You Made Me Do,"" but not everything she\'s done so far has been welcomed with open arms. A big discovery was made shortly after she announced when her next album would be released \xe2\x80\x94 it coincided with the 10th anniversary of Kanye West\'s mother passing away.\n\nThough Swift was, well, swift to deny any intent to antagonize Kanye with the drop date, she has resorted to all sorts of petty moves in the past. Her discontent with Kanye runs deep, from award show embarrassments to his infamous, ""I made that b---h famous"" line on ""Famous,"" so she has the motivation to attack him and his family if she wants to.\n\nNot content to take Swift\'s denial at face value, Kanye fans have decided to strike back against the pop star, and they\'re planning their own event for Nov. 10. Allow me to introduce you to ""Hey Mama"" day, a concept dreamed up by some of Kanye\'s biggest fans on the r/Kanye subreddit. Here\'s a brief description of what they plan to accomplish. The subreddit that started it all. Reddit\n\n""Basically, Taylor Swift has released a Kanye diss track, taken shots at Kim\'s Paris robbery, and has stolen Kanye\'s font and cover art style for her new album \'Reputation.\' Most importantly she is planning on releasing it on the anniversary of Kanye\'s mother, Donda West\'s death - November 10. Basically, we have the idea to repeatedly stream a singular Kanye song on that date, hopefully getting that song the #1 spot on daily streams over any of Taylor\'s songs. We are focussing on a single song as it will be much easier to concentrate our efforts into that, than say a whole album getting to #1.""\n\nThe post gained enough traction that it rose near the top of the subreddit, and now there\'s an event page for the day on Facebook. The title has been altered a bit to, ""Listen to Hey Mama by Kanye West Day"" but the concept is still the same, and the interest is beginning to grow. So far, around 2,200 dedicated fans (or T. Swift haters) have declared interest in participating, and Spotify playlists of just ""Hey Mama"" have been created in advance of the event. These people are not messing around.'"

Could there be any truth to the story?\n\nLife & Style is claiming that Stefani was not happy with how close Shelton had become with Chloe Kohanski, his 24-year-old team member on The Voice.

(Adam Rose/ABC via AP)\n\nThe new season of \xe2\x80\x9cRoseanne\xe2\x80\x9d wrapped production back in December, and while another cycle of the reboot has been ordered, filming has not yet resumed. In fact, when The Hollywood Reporter reported the \xe2\x80\x9cRoseanne\xe2\x80\x9d renewal last month, the trade outlet specifically noted, \xe2\x80\x9cThere was no immediate word whether the network plans to have it ready for fall.\xe2\x80\x9d Additionally, the president ABC Entertainment said in a statement that executives \xe2\x80\x9ccan\xe2\x80\x99t wait to see what the \xe2\x80\x98Roseanne\xe2\x80\x99 team has in store for next year.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIn other words, production isn\xe2\x80\x99t taking place right now, so the timing of these claims from a supposed \xe2\x80\x9con-set source\xe2\x80\x9d makes little sense. It seems as if the tabloid and the website just wanted to capitalize on the ongoing attention \xe2\x80\x9cRoseanne\xe2\x80\x9d is receiving as it currently airs, and decided to concoct an unsupported narrative based on its controversial lead actress\xe2\x80\x99s religious faith. Roseanne has spoken highly of Kabbalah in the past, and isn\xe2\x80\x99t shy about referencing Judaism on Twitter. But that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean she\xe2\x80\x99s preaching on the set of her TV series to the chagrin of her co-workers.\n\nA rep for Roseanne tells Gossip Cop on the record that these new reports are \xe2\x80\x9cabsolutely not true.\xe2\x80\x9d It also wasn\xe2\x80\x99t true last week when these same sister publications cited an unnamed \xe2\x80\x9csource\xe2\x80\x9d and untraceable \xe2\x80\x9cTV exec\xe2\x80\x9d to falsely allege Roseanne was demanding a raise to $1 million per episode. That unsubstantiated claim was also problematic and, similar to now, oddly timed. Again, it appears the magazine and the blog are offering fiction just to exploit a fictional TV show.\n\nSlideshow: Gossip Cop busts more of the latest tabloid stories'"

"b""Daniel Day-Lewis was never really a part of cinema for us to miss him. His purpose was much larger.\n\nThe term 'greatest' has been used by just about everyone when it comes to Daniel Day-Lewis, right from the time the three-time Oscar winner burst upon the scene.\n\nPerhaps that is the reason why anytime Daniel Day-Lewis announces anything it is met with reverence reserved for the gods - be it his silent disappearance from the scene following the release of his film Boxer (1999) or his 'return' to acting with Martin Scorsese's Gangs of New York (2002) or the way he told a close few friends that he was off to Dublin post-Lincoln (2012), his last completed film.\n\nAs expected then the news of him announcing his retirement from acting has evoked a similar response and considering the reaction, perhaps the world is not going to be same again.\n\nGreat as his acting is and brilliant as he may be when it comes to preparing for a role, Daniel Day-Lewis leaving acting is not as great a tragedy as some would like us to believe.\n\nThe thing that probably makes Day-Lewis one of the most preeminent actors of our times, in not just his craft but also the way his craft touches the audiences. He's known to fully immerse himself in the character that he is playing to an unbelievable degree. To say that Day-Lewis is merely acting for the camera while in a film would be an understatement.\n\nDuring the making of My Left Foot he famously remained in character, as the writer with cerebral palsy, to the extent that he was spoon-fed by the crew. For In the Name of the Father (1993) he slept in an abandoned jail and ate only prison rations. For The Crucible (1996), he lived in the film set's replica village without electricity or running water and built his character's house with 17th-century tools and most famously for Gangs of New York he trained as a butcher, caught pneumonia while on set after effusing to change his threadbare coat for a warmer one because it hadn't existed in the 19th century and even wandered about Rome (where Gangs was filmed) in character, fighting strangers.\n\nThere is a 'great' Daniel Day-Lewis preparation for every decade from the 1990s till the 2010s and these roles have been acknowledged by the biggest honour possible for any actor - an Academy Award.\n\nHe won his second and third Oscar for There Will Be Blood (2007) and Lincoln (2012) respectively and was nominated for In the of the Father and Gangs of New York. The emotional excessiveness that Day-Lewis' performances display has connected with audiences consistently for the last three decades and therefore watching him become a character has almost become the gold standard.\n\nFor most film fans watching an actor trained in the Method, a style where the artist is supposed to delve deep into his or her own consciousness and allow one\xe2\x80\x99s self to \xe2\x80\x98become\xe2\x80\x99 the character, has held great fascination since Marlon Brando made it fashionable in the late 1940s.\n\nThe sheer effort that Day-Lewis puts in by itself becomes enough for any 'Daniel Day-Lewis' performance to be considered great. You knew that The Last of the Mohicans (1992) was the real thing because the Hawkeye (Daniel Day-Lewis) you saw on the screen actually lived off the land for six months, trained how to track and skin animals.\n\nSimilarly, to prepare for There Will Be Blood Day-Lewis insisted on living in a tent on an abandoned Texas oilfield and therefore he could interpret the feelings and the emotions of the late twentieth-century oil prospector, Daniel Plainview, to perfection. It is hardly surprising then that it was enough for Day-Lewis to show up in order to be judged best actor at most award functions.\n\nYet watching Day-Lewis play a character can also be a boring affair.\n\nUnless some great co-stars accompany him such as Joan Allen in The Crucible or a well-cast Michelle Pfeiffer with Winona Ryder in The Age of Innocence (1993), Day-Lewis, at times, seems to be acting in a vacuum. See him in the scenes with Leonardo Di Caprio in The Gangs of New York or next to Tommy Lee Jones in Lincoln and you notice how most of the times his co-stars look as if they are waiting for him to get done.\n\nThere are times when his acting overburdens the very film such as Lincoln where some critics couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help but mention that despite being immaculately acted (largely by Day-Lewis, of course) it was a terribly dull film. Day-Lewis cannot be blamed if a film falls short of meeting his \xe2\x80\x98expectations\xe2\x80\x99 but the places where he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have anything gargantuan to bite into (say the musical Nine [2009] or The Ballad of Jack & Rose [2005]) he can be insipid.\n\nIn the end, the reality of not watching another Daniel Day-Lewis performance after Phantom Thread, his \xe2\x80\x98last\xe2\x80\x99 film that releases later this year, can be a matter of sadness for anyone who has ever enjoyed a film ever. But at the same time, Day-Lewis was never really there for us to miss him. Actors quit for a host of reasons and then also make a comeback but the chances of Day-Lewis being coaxed into facing the camera ever again are perhaps actually low.\n\nIn an interview, he once mentioned that letting go of the characters he has so lovingly created is a hard thing and added, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen you've been someone else for that amount of time, it's even more absurd when it's all over.\xe2\x80\x9d Perhaps Day-Lewis\xe2\x80\x99 insane, overblown preparations somewhere allowed him to be what he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be in real life and once you become someone else being yourself can be a boring affair.\n\nAre there then no other people left for him to be that he decided to quit at 60, an age when many other great actors have hit a golden phase of their career? Or could it be that he never wants the preparation for a role to end and only \xe2\x80\x98retirement\xe2\x80\x99 offers him the solace of being in character forever?"""

He wished the prince and Meghan Markle \xe2\x80\x9ca lifetime of joy and happiness\xe2\x80\x9d on Twitter. The message was in no way a massive hint to the royals that he and Michelle were \xe2\x80\x9cavailable\xe2\x80\x9d to attend their wedding ceremony.

It won\xe2\x80\x99t come as a result of desperate pleas on social media.

The Spectacular Now actor Miles Teller and Keleigh Sperry, comedian Patton Oswalt and Meredith Salanger (this one was a little controversial considering his wife passed away less than a year before), Star Wars actress Felicity Jones and Charles Guard, and many more. 2017 also brought two famous exes back together after YEARS of being apart, and soon, they\xe2\x80\x99ll be headed down the alter.

"b""Eric Johnson Net Worth: Eric Johnson is an American football player who has a net worth of $10 million. Though it should be noted that the majority of Eric's net worth is attributable to his wife Jessica Simpson, whom he marred in 2014. Born Eric Maxwell Johnson on September 15, 1979, in Needham, Massachusetts, US, he played as a tight end in the National Football League. Athletically gifted Johnson first got the chance to flaunt his football skills on a wider scale at Yale, where he played as a wide receiver. He was the one to catch 21 receptions for 244 yards in Yale's come-from-behind victory against Harvard in 1999, including the game-winning touchdown catch. He turned pro after he was drafted by the San Francisco 49ers in the seventh round of the 2001 NFL Draft. When healthy, he was a big contributor to the 49ers passing game. But still, he did miss all of the 2003 and 2005seasons, due to injuries. He remained with the San Francisco 49ers until 2006, and he signed a one-year contract with the New Orleans Saints in 2007. The following year he got re-signed by the team, but the Saints released him for good on July 31, 2008.

"b'Scottish comedian\n\nSir William Connolly, (born 24 November 1942) is a retired Scottish stand-up comedian, musician, presenter, actor, and artist. He is sometimes known, especially in his homeland, by the Scots nickname The Big Yin (""The Big One"").[1] Known for his idiosyncratic and often off-the-cuff observational comedy, which frequently includes the use of profanity, Connolly is regarded as one of the greatest and most influential stand-up comedians of all time, having topped multiple polls conducted in the United Kingdom.[2][3][4][5]\n\nConnolly\'s first trade, in the early 1960s, was as a welder (specifically a boilermaker) in the Glasgow shipyards, but he gave it up towards the end of the decade to pursue a career as a folk singer. He first sang in the folk rock band The Humblebums alongside friends Gerry Rafferty and Tam Harvey, with whom he stayed until 1974, before beginning singing as a solo artist. In the early 1970s, Connolly made the transition from folk singer with a comedic persona to fully-fledged comedian, for which he is now best known. In 1972, he made his theatrical debut, at the Cottage Theatre in Cumbernauld, with a revue called Connolly\'s Glasgow Flourish.[6] He also played the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. In 1972, Connolly\'s first solo album, Billy Connolly Live!, was produced, with a mixture of comedic songs and short monologues.\n\nAs an actor, Connolly has appeared in such films as Indecent Proposal (1993), Pocahontas (1995), Muppet Treasure Island (1996), Mrs Brown (1997) (for which he was nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role), The Boondock Saints (1999), The Last Samurai (2003), Lemony Snicket\'s A Series of Unfortunate Events (2004), The X-Files: I Want to Believe (2008), Brave (2012), and The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies (2014). On his 75th birthday in 2017, three portraits of Connolly were made by leading artists Jack Vettriano, John Byrne, and Rachel Maclean. These were later turned into part of Glasgow\'s official mural trail. In October of the same year, he was knighted at Buckingham Palace by Prince William, for services to entertainment and charity.\n\nConnolly announced his retirement from comedy in 2018,[7] and in recent years he has established himself as an artist. In 2020, he stated ""My art is about revealing myself"" as he unveiled the fifth release of his Born on a Rainy Day collection in London.[8]\n\nEarly life [ edit ]\n\nConnolly was born at 69 Dover Street,[9] ""on the linoleum, three floors up""[10] ""at six o\'clock in the evening"",[9] in Anderston, Glasgow. This section of Dover Street, between Breadalbane and Claremont streets, was demolished in the 1970s.[9] Connolly refers to this in his 1983 song ""I Wish I Was in Glasgow"" with the lines ""I would take you there and show you but they\'ve pulled the building down"" and ""they bulldozed it all to make a road"". The flat had only two rooms: a kitchen-living room, with a recess where the children slept, and another room for their parents. The family bathed in the kitchen sink, and there was no hot water.[11]\n\nConnolly was born to Catholic parents, William Connolly and Mary McLean, both of whom were of partly Irish descent.[12] In 1946, when he was four years old, Connolly\'s mother left her children while their father was serving as an engineer in the Royal Air Force in Burma.[11] ""I\'ve never felt abandoned by her,"" Connolly explained in 2009.[13] ""My mother was a teenager. My father was in Burma, fighting a bloody war. The Germans were dropping all kinds of crap on the town. We lived at the docks, so that\'s where all the bombs were happening. She was a teenager with two kids in a slum. A guy comes along and says, \'I love you. Come with me.\' Given the choice, I think I\'d have gone with him. It looks as though it might all end next Wednesday, from where you\'re standing. I don\'t have an ounce of feelings that she abandoned me. She tried to survive.""[13]\n\nConnolly and his older sister, Florence (named after their maternal grandmother, and eighteen months his senior),[11][14] were cared for by two aunts, Margaret and Mona Connolly, his father\'s sisters, in their cramped tenement in Stewartville Street, Partick. ""My aunts constantly told me I was stupid, which still affects me today pretty badly. It\'s just a belief that I\'m not quite as good as anyone else. It gets worse as you get older. I\'m a happy man now but I still have the scars of that.""[6] Regarding his sister, Connolly has called her his ""great defender"".[13] ""To this day, he explained in 2009,[13] ""Guys say, \'God, your sister... We didn\'t dare beat you up \xe2\x80\x93 your sister was a nightmare\'. She used to get after them.""\n\nIn the mid-1960s, Flo was on holiday in Dunoon with her husband and two children. ""My mother said, \'I saw Florence walking along, and I followed her.\'""[13] ""I said, \'Did you speak to her?\' \'Oh, no, I didn\'t,\' she said. I thought, \'Oh, my god. It\'s like being a ghost while you\'re still alive.\' Walking behind your own child. Having a look. I couldn\'t bear that.""[13]\n\nThe aunts resented the children for the fact that they had to sacrifice their young lives to look after them. It was Mona who was troubled the most by having to care for her niece and nephew. ""It was very big of her to take on the responsibility, but having said that, I wish people wouldn\'t do that. I wish people wouldn\'t be very big for five minutes and rotten for twenty years. Just keep your \'big\' and keep your \'rotten\' and get out of my life, because, quite frankly, I would rather have gone to a children\'s home and be with a lot of other kids being treated the same. To this day, I\'m still working on the things she did to me.""[15][16]\n\nConnolly credits one of John Bradshaw\'s publications with helping him deal with his past demons. ""He reckons that if this trauma happened to you when you were five or six then, emotionally, that part of you remains five or six. And what you have to do is carry that five- or six-year-old around with you and try and emotionally help that other part of you. It sounds a bit airy-fairy, but I think he\'s something of a genius, Mr. Bradshaw.""[15]\n\nConnolly, Sr. returned from the war, a stranger to his children, shortly after the move to Partick. He never spoke to them about their mother\'s departure.[11] Connolly\'s biography, Billy, written by wife Pamela Stephenson, documented years of physical and sexual abuse by his father, which began when he was ten and lasted until he was about 15.[17] ""Sometimes, when father hit me, I flew over the settee backwards in a sitting position. It was fabulous. Just like real flying, except you didn\'t get a cup of tea or a safety belt or anything.""[11] In 1949, Mona gave birth to a son, Michael, by a ""local man"". He was presented as a brother to Billy and Flo, and nobody questioned it.[11]\n\nConnolly\'s bedroom had double windows, which directly faced St Peter\'s Primary School across the street.[15] Now defunct, the school has been converted into living accommodation. ""The school was very violent indeed. At first, in the infant school, the nuns were very violent. And then over here at St Peter\'s, they were just strapping you all the time. I had a psychopath in here, called McDonald \xe2\x80\x94 Miss McDonald. ""Big Rosie"", they called her. There was a guy with glasses in my class and she called him ""four eyes"", and she was a teacher!""[18]\n\nAt St. Peter\'s, Connolly decided that he wanted to make people laugh. ""I can remember the moment in the school playground. I would have been 7 or 8. And I was sitting in a puddle and people were laughing. I had fallen in it and people found it funny. And it wasn\'t all that uncomfortable, so I stayed in it longer than I normally would because I really enjoyed the laughing. My life was very unhappy at the time, and laughter wasn\'t something I heard all the time, so it was a joy. And I realised quickly that if you can have an audience this way, life was rather pleasant.""[15] While at St Peter\'s, Connolly joined a gang. His arch-enemy was Geordie Sinclair, who lived around the corner.[13]\n\nConnolly was a Wolf Cub with the 141st Glasgow Scout Group. He revisits the site of one field trip, Auchengillan scout camp, during his World Tour of Scotland.[10] At age 12, Connolly decided he wanted to become a comedian but did not think that he fitted the mould, feeling he needed to become more ""windswept and interesting"". Also at that age, he joined an organisation called The Children of Mary. The group would visit people and say the Rosary, with a statue of the Lady of Lourdes in a shoebox. ""We were as welcome as haemorrhoids.""[13] The group would all kneel around the statue and pray. ""You could hear people hurrying prayers because there was a good television programme coming.""[13]\n\nIn the 1950s, Glasgow\'s sandstone tenements fell out of favour with the planners, which resulted in new houses being built on the fields and farmlands in the outskirts of the city. Between the ages of fourteen and twenty, Connolly was brought up on a now-demolished council estate on Kinfauns Drive in the Drumchapel district of Glasgow, and would make the daily journey to St. Gerard\'s Secondary School (also now defunct) in Govan, on the southern side of the River Clyde. He rode the bus to Partick, crossed the water by ferry and walked to 80 Vicarfield Street.[1][10]\n\n""Drumchapel is a housing estate just outside Glasgow. Well, it\'s in Glasgow, but just outside civilisation,"" he has joked.[10] ""To be quite honest, I quite liked it when I lived there. When I moved to Drumchapel, I was fourteen and there was a bluebell wood there, and it was in great condition then \xe2\x80\x94 I don\'t think it\'s in quite so good condition now \xe2\x80\x94 but it was lovely then. We had rabbits and pheasants, and I really quite liked it. I just started to dislike it when I got older, into my teens and things. In my late teens, when I was stuck out there, it cost me a lot of money to go anyplace. It was a kind of cowboy town, but I liked that aspect of it, buying stuff out of vans, a ragman coming in a wee green van.""[11]\n\nConnolly revisited this tenement in Drumchapel during filming for The South Bank Show in 1992.[19] ""It eventually started to pall. This dreadful atmosphere came about the place. It\'s like Siberia. And once you\'re out here, there\'s no getting out of it. You have to buy your way out, or some kind of talent has to take you out, or you have to be very bright and move away to university.""[15]\n\nAlso at fourteen, Connolly started to become interested in music \xe2\x80\x94 mainly Jerry Lee Lewis and Chuck Berry. At fifteen, he left school with two engineering qualifications, one collected by mistake which belonged to a boy named Connell.[20]\n\nConnolly was a year too young to work in the shipyards. Instead, he started working for John Smith\'s Bookshop, on St Vincent Street, delivering books on his bicycle. He became a delivery-van driver with Bilslands\' Bakery until he was sixteen, when he was deemed overqualified (due to his J1 and J2 certificates) to become an engineer.[20] Instead, he worked as a boilermaker[21] at Alexander Stephen and Sons shipyard in Linthouse.[20]\n\n""What an extraordinary feeling,"" Connolly said, upon returning to the site of the now-demolished shipyard in 1992.[15] ""I spent a great deal of my life in here. From age 16 to... well, I started at 15. I started my apprenticeship at 16 and finished when I was 21. Stayed till I was 22, and moved along. I finished welding when I was 24. When I came here, as an apprentice, there was six ships being built, right where I\'m standing. It was an extraordinary place. A hive of activity. Welders, caulkers, platers, burners, joiners, engineers, electricians. I learned how men talked to one another, and how merciless Glasgow humour can be. It has made an indelible mark on me.""[15] His foreman was Sammy Boyd, but the two biggest influences on him, according to the book written by his wife Pamela, were Jimmy Lucas and Bobby Dalgleish. Jimmy was one of Billy\'s trainers in the yard who helped him to hone his skills as a welder and a comedian.\n\nConnolly also joined the Territorial Army Reserve unit 15th (Scottish) Battalion, the Parachute Regiment (15 PARA). He later commemorated his experiences in the song ""Weekend Soldier"".[20]\n\nCareer [ edit ]\n\nOrigin of ""The Big Yin"" [ edit ]\n\nConnolly\'s nickname The Big Yin was first used during his adolescent years to differentiate between himself and his father.[1] ""My father was a very strong man. Broad and strong. He had an 18\xc2\xbd-inch neck collar. Huge, like a bull. He was ""Big Billy"" and I was ""Wee Billy"". And then I got bigger than him, and the whole thing got out of control. And then I became The Big Yin in Scotland. So, we\'d go into the pub and someone would say, \'Billy Connolly was in.\' \'Oh? Big Billy or Wee Billy?\' \'The Big Yin.\' \'Oh, Wee Billy.\' If you were a stranger, you\'d think, \'What are these people talking about?!\'""[21]\n\n1960s [ edit ]\n\nIn the early 1960s, Connolly attended the Edinburgh Festival Fringe for the first time. After spending time on the city\'s Rose Street, patronising the various drinking establishments, he became enamoured by some long-haired musicians and decided to model himself on them.[22]\n\nIn 1965, after he had completed a 5-year apprenticeship as a boilermaker, Connolly accepted a ten-week job building an oil platform in Biafra, Nigeria. Upon his return to the United Kingdom, via Jersey, he worked briefly at John Brown & Company but decided to walk out on a Fair Friday to focus on being a folk singer.\n\nAfter watching The Beverly Hillbillies, he bought his first banjo at the Barrowland market.[11] He began to tour with the Folkie crowd, including regular stints at The Scotia bar, on Stockwell Street, guided by folk singer Danny Kyle. ""I kind of introduced Billy to the folk clubs, such as there were in those days \xe2\x80\x93 there were very few in the those days. We used to go to places like Saturday Late or the Montrose Street Glasgow Folk Club.""[15]\n\nConnolly formed a folk-pop duo called the Humblebums with Tam Harvey. In 1969, they were joined by Gerry Rafferty, who had approached Connolly after a gig in Paisley. The band signed for independent label, Transatlantic Records, and after recording one album (1969\'s First Collection of Merry Melodies), Harvey left the trio and Connolly and Rafferty went on to release two more albums: The New Humblebums (1969) and Open up the Door (1970). Connolly\'s time with Rafferty possibly influenced his future comedy, because years later he would recall how Rafferty\'s expert prank telephone calls, made while waiting to go on stage, used to make him ""scream"" with laughter. Connolly\'s contributions were primarily straightforward pop-folk with quirky and whimsical lyrics, but he had not especially focused on comedy at this point.\n\nIn 1968,[13] a 26-year-old Connolly married Springburn native and interior designer Iris Pressagh, with whom he had two children. They initially lived on Redlands Road in Glasgow\'s West End, but when fans began to wait out in the street, they moved to Drymen near the south-eastern shore of Loch Lomond.\n\nLater that year,[13] Connolly\'s mother went to meet him backstage after a Humblebums gig in Dunoon, where she was working in the cafeteria at Dunoon General Hospital. It was the second and final meeting between them since she had abandoned Connolly.[11] She had been living in the town with her partner, Willie Adams, with whom she had three daughters and a son.[23] ""I went home to her house and stayed the night, instead of the hotel. The sadness is... She was a very nice woman, but we never got along. We both tried to like each other, and I don\'t think she liked me very much. I don\'t regret it, but I\'m sad about it. I wish I\'d liked her. And I wish she\'d liked me.""[13]\n\nIn 1971, the Humblebums broke up, with Rafferty going on to record his solo album Can I Have My Money Back? Connolly returned to being a folk singer. His live performances featured humorous introductions that became increasingly long in duration. The head of Transatlantic Records, Nat Joseph, who had signed The Humblebums and had nurtured their career, was concerned that Connolly find a way to develop a distinctive solo career just as his former bandmate, Gerry Rafferty, was doing.[citation needed] Joseph saw several of Connolly\'s performances and noted his comedic skills. Joseph had nurtured the recording career of another Scottish folk entertainer, Hamish Imlach, and saw potential in Connolly following a similar path. He suggested to Connolly that he drop the folk-singing and focus primarily on becoming a comedian.[citation needed]\n\n1970s [ edit ]\n\nIn 1972, Connolly made his theatrical debut, at the Cottage Theatre in Cumbernauld, with a revue called Connolly\'s Glasgow Flourish.[6] He played the Edinburgh Festival Fringe with poet Tom Buchan, with whom he had written The Great Northern Welly Boot Show, and in costumes designed by the artist and writer John Byrne, who also designed the covers of the Humblebums\' records.[6]\n\nAlso in 1972, Nat Joseph produced Connolly\'s first solo album, Billy Connolly Live!, a mixture of comedic songs and short monologues that hinted at what was to follow. In late 1973, Joseph produced the breakthrough album that propelled Connolly to British stardom. Recorded at a small venue, The Tudor Hotel in Airdrie, the record was a double album titled Solo Concert. Releasing a live double-album by a comedian who was virtually unknown (except to a cult audience in Glasgow) was an unusual gambit by Joseph but his faith in Connolly\'s talent turned out to be warranted. Joseph and his marketing team, which included publicist Martin Lewis, promoted the album to chart success on its release in 1974. It featured one of Connolly\'s most famous comedy routines \xe2\x80\x94 ""The Crucifixion"" \xe2\x80\x94 in which he likens Christ\'s Last Supper to a drunken night out in Glasgow. The recording was banned by many radio stations at the time.\n\n[24] Connolly\'s banana boots, designed and made by Glasgow Pop Artist Edmund Smith and a regular in his act during the 1970s, are now on display in the People\'s Palace in Glasgow.\n\nIn 1974, he sold out the Pavilion Theatre in his home town.[6] In 1975, the rapidity and extent of Connolly\'s breakthrough was used to secure him a booking on Britain\'s premier TV chat show, the BBC\'s Parkinson. Connolly made the most of the opportunity and, ignoring objections from his manager,[6] told a bawdy joke about a man who had murdered his wife and buried her bottom-up so he\'d have somewhere to park his bike. This ribald humour was unusually forthright on a primetime Saturday night on British television in the mid-1970s, and his appearance made a great impact. ""When I finished that show, I came back to Glasgow, and I was coming through the airport and the whole airport started to applaud.""[25] Connolly became a good friend of the host, Michael Parkinson, and now holds the record for appearances on the programme, having been a guest on fifteen occasions.[26] Referring to that debut appearance, he later said: ""That programme changed my entire life."" Parkinson, in the documentary, Billy Connolly: Erect for 30 Years, stated that people still remember Connolly telling the punchline to the \'bike joke\' three decades after that TV appearance. When asked about the material, Connolly stated, ""Yes, it was incredibly edgy for its time. My manager, on the way over, warned me not to do it, but it was a great joke and the interview was going so well, I thought, \'Oh, fuck that!!\' I don\'t know where I got the courage in those days, but Michael did put confidence in me.""[26] Connolly\'s success spread to other English-speaking countries: Australia, New Zealand, and Canada. However, his broad Scottish accent and British cultural references made success in the US improbable.\n\nHis increased profile led to contact with other celebrities; including musicians such as Elton John. John at that time was trying to assist British performers whom he personally liked to achieve success in the United States (he had released records in the US by veteran British pop singer Cliff Richard on his own Rocket label). John tried to give Connolly a boost in America by using him as the opening act on his 1976 US tour, but the well-intentioned gesture was a failure. John\'s American fans had no interest in being warmed-up by an unknown comedian \xe2\x80\x93 especially a Scotsman whose accent they found incomprehensible. ""In Washington, some guy threw a pipe and it hit me right between my eyes"", he told Michael Parkinson two years later. ""It wasn\'t my audience. They made me feel about as welcome as a fart in a spacesuit.""[27] The quip caused fellow guest Angie Dickinson to laugh uncontrollably.[28]\n\nConnolly continued to grow in popularity in the UK. In 1975, he signed with Polydor Records. Connolly continued to release live albums and he also recorded several comedic songs that enjoyed commercial success as novelty singles including parodies of Tammy Wynette\'s song ""D.I.V.O.R.C.E."" (which he performed on Top of the Pops in December 1975) and the Village People\'s ""In the Navy"" (titled ""In the Brownies"").[6]\n\nIn 1976, Connolly\'s first play, An\' Me wi\' a Bad Leg, Tae, opened in Irvine and toured in London. It was there that, after consuming a sizable amount of cocaine and alcohol, he collapsed on the floor of a recording studio.[6] In 1979, Connolly met Pamela Stephenson, the New Zealand-born comedy actress, for the first time when he made a cameo appearance on the BBC sketch show, Not the Nine O\'Clock News, in which she was one of the four regular performers.[6]\n\nReturning to the stage, Connolly embarked on his Big Wee Tour of Britain, performing 69 dates in 84 days. While backstage in Brighton, he met Stephenson for a second time. He confided in her that he was unhappy and that his current marriage was over. Back at his hotel, where they began an affair, he reportedly drank thirty brandies. ""What I saw of him \xe2\x80\x93 particularly in that dressing room \xe2\x80\x93 was that he was about to die,"" Stephenson said. ""He was very suicidal. He was throwing everything away, desperately trying to feel no pain at all. You know how you get a sense from some people when they are very self-destructive that there is something they are trying to bury? They\'ve got something they are trying to forget, or they are trying to drown their sorrows? He was hurting in a very deep way. I thought, \'If I leave this man, he\'s going to die.\'""[6]\n\nAlso in 1979, Connolly was invited by producer Martin Lewis to join the cast of The Secret Policeman\'s Ball, the third in the series of The Secret Policeman\'s Balls fundraising shows for Amnesty International. Connolly was the first comedic performer in the series who was not an alumnus of the Oxbridge school of middle-class university-educated entertainers and he made the most of his appearance. Appearing in the company of long-established talents such as John Cleese and Peter Cook helped elevate the perception of Connolly as one of Britain\'s leading comedic talents. Lewis also teamed Connolly with Cleese and Cook to appear in the television commercial for the album.\n\n1980s [ edit ]\n\nIn 1981, John Cleese and Martin Lewis invited Connolly to appear in that year\'s Amnesty show, The Secret Policeman\'s Other Ball. The commercial success of the special US version of The Secret Policeman\'s Other Ball film (Miramax Films, 1982) introduced Connolly to a wider American audience, who were attracted to the film because of the presence of Monty Python members. His on-screen presence alongside these performers \xe2\x80\x93 who were already familiar to Anglophile comedy buffs \xe2\x80\x93 helped lay down a marker for Connolly\'s eventual return to the US in his own right eight years later.\n\nEn route to begin filming Water (1985) in Saint Lucia, Connolly drank an excessive amount of alcohol on the plane. Upon arriving on the island, he had dinner with the cast and crew, including Michael Caine.\n\n""They had a jolly evening, then travelled back by bus through a part of the island that features steep cliffs on either side of a jungle road. As they careered along, Billy thought it would be a wheeze to cover the driver\'s eyes with his hands. \'I\'ll guide you,\' insisted our drunken control-freak, \'Left, right... more right.\' It was a game he had apparently played with his London driver: God knows how they managed to survive. Michael Caine apprehended Billy just in time to save the bus from plunging down a St Lucian ravine."" \xe2\x80\x93 Excerpt from Billy by Pamela Stephenson (2001)[18]\n\nIn 1985, he divorced Iris Pressagh, his wife of sixteen years (they had separated four years earlier), and he was awarded custody of their children Jamie and Cara.[18][23] That same year, he performed An Audience with..., which was videotaped at the South Bank Television Centre in front of a celebrity audience for ITV. The uncut, uncensored version was subsequently released on video. In July 1985, Connolly performed at Live Aid at Wembley Stadium, immediately preceding Elton John, whom he introduced on stage.[29]\n\n1990s [ edit ]\n\nAlthough Connolly had performed in North America as early as the 1970s and had appeared in several movies that played in American theatres, he nonetheless remained relatively unknown until 1990 when he was featured in the HBO special Whoopi Goldberg and Billy Connolly in Performance, produced by New York\'s Brooklyn Academy of Music. Soon after, Connolly succeeded Howard Hesseman as the star of the sitcom, Head of the Class for its final season. He would also take part on its spin-off series Billy. Connolly joined boxer Frank Bruno and Ozzy Osbourne when singing ""The War Song of the Urpneys"" in the British animated television series The Dreamstone.[30]\n\nIn 1991, HBO released Billy Connolly: Pale Blue Scottish Person, a standup performance recorded at the Wilshire Ebell Theatre in Los Angeles, California.[31]\n\nOn 4 June 1992, Connolly performed his 25th-anniversary concert in Glasgow. Parts of the show and its build-up were documented in The South Bank Show, which aired later in the year.[32] In early January 1994, Connolly began a 40-date World Tour of Scotland, which would be broadcast by the BBC later in the year as a six-part series. It was so well received he did Billy Connolly\'s World Tour of Australia for the BBC in 1995. The eight-part series followed Connolly on his custom-made Harley Davidson trike. Also in 1995, Connolly recorded a BBC special, entitled A Scot in the Arctic, in which he spent a week by himself in the Arctic Circle. He voiced Captain John Smith\'s shipmate, Ben, in Disney\'s animated film, Pocahontas.[33]\n\nIn 1996, he appeared in Muppet Treasure Island as Billy Bones. In 1997, he starred with Dame Judi Dench in Mrs Brown, in which he played John Brown, the favoured Scottish servant of Queen Victoria. He was nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role and a BAFTA Scotland Award for Best Actor, as well as a Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance.[34]\n\nIn 1998, Connolly\'s best friend, Danny Kyle, died. ""He was my dearest, dearest, oldest friend"", Connolly explained to an Australian audience on his Greatest Hits compilation, released in 2001. It was Kyle who helped Connolly overcome his recoiling nature at being touched by others, a remnant of the abuse he endured as a child. ""Every time it happened, Danny would just collapse with hysterics,"" said Pamela Stephenson.[11] ""\'That\'s not normal, Billy,\' Danny tried to be patient with him. \'You\'ll have to relax. It\'s touchy-feely, you know, the way we live. We like to touch each other and we kiss: we\'re different. You\'ll have to calm down or you\'ll always be fighting.\'""[11]\n\nHe performed a cover version of the Beatles\' song, ""Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite"" on George Martin\'s 1998 album, In My Life. In November 1998, Connolly was the subject of a two-hour retrospective entitled, Billy Connolly: Erect for 30 Years, which included tributes from Dench, Sir Sean Connery, Whoopi Goldberg, Robin Williams, Dustin Hoffman, and Eddie Izzard.[35]\n\nIn 1999, after forming Tickety-Boo management company with Malcolm Kingsnorth, his tour manager and sound engineer of 25 years, Connolly undertook a four-month, 59-date sellout tour of Australia and New Zealand. Later in the year, he completed a five-week, 25-date sellout run at London\'s Hammersmith Apollo.\n\n2000s [ edit ]\n\nFuck. In the film he states the word fuck can be understood despite one\'s language or location. Connolly in the 2005 documentary film. In the film he states the word fuck can be understood despite one\'s language or location.\n\nIn 2000, Connolly starred in Beautiful Joe alongside Sharon Stone. The following year, he completed the third in his ""World Tour"" BBC series, this time of England, Ireland and Wales, which began in Dublin and ended in Plymouth. It was broadcast the following year. Also in 2001, Stephenson\'s first biography of her husband, Billy, was published. Much of the book is about Connolly the celebrity but the account of his early years provides a context for his humour and point of view. A follow-up, Bravemouth, was published in 2003.\n\nA fourth BBC series, World Tour of New Zealand, was filmed in 2004 and aired that winter. Also in his 63rd year, Connolly performed two sold-out benefit concerts at the Oxford New Theatre in memory of Malcolm Kingsnorth. He has continued to be a much in-demand character actor, appearing in several films such as White Oleander (2002), The Last Samurai (2003), and Lemony Snicket\'s A Series of Unfortunate Events (2004). He has played an eclectic collection of leading roles in recent years, including a lawyer who undertakes a legal case of Biblical proportions in The Man Who Sued God (2001), and a young boy\'s pet zombie in Fido (2006).[36]\n\nAlso in 2005, Connolly and Stephenson announced, after fourteen years of living in Hollywood, they were returning to live in the former\'s native land. They purchased a 120-foot (37 m) yacht with the profits from their house-sale and split the year between Malta and the 12-bedroom Candacraig House in Strathdon, Aberdeenshire, which they had purchased in 2008 from Dame Anita Roddick.[36][37]\n\nLater in the year, Connolly topped an unscientific poll of ""Britain\'s Favourite Comedian"" conducted by the network Five, placing him ahead of performers such as John Cleese, Ronnie Barker, Dawn French, and Peter Cook. In 2006, he revealed he has a house on the Maltese island of Gozo.[38] He and his wife also have an apartment in New York City near Union Square.[39]\n\nOn 30 December 2007, Connolly escaped uninjured from a single-car accident on the A939 near Ballater, Aberdeenshire.[40]\n\n2010s [ edit ]\n\nIn 2011, Connolly and his wife were living full-time in New York City, whilst retaining their Candacraig residence.[41] The Connollys decided to sell Candacraig House in September 2013, with a price of \xc2\xa32.75 million.[36]\n\nIn 2012, Connolly provided the voice of King Fergus in Pixar\'s Scotland-set animated film Brave, alongside fellow Scottish actors Kelly Macdonald, Craig Ferguson, Robbie Coltrane, Emma Thompson, and Kevin McKidd. Connolly appeared as Wilf in Quartet, a 2012 British comedy-drama film based on the play Quartet by Ronald Harwood, directed by Dustin Hoffman.\n\nIn 2014, he appeared in The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies as D\xc3\xa1in II Ironfoot, a great dwarf warrior and cousin of Thorin II Oakenshield. Peter Jackson stated: ""We could not think of a more fitting actor to play Dain Ironfoot, the staunchest and toughest of dwarves, than Billy Connolly, the Big Yin himself. With Billy stepping into this role, the cast of The Hobbit is now complete. We can\'t wait to see him on the battlefield.""[42]\n\nSteve Brown, Connolly\'s manager of 32 years, died in December 2017 at the age of 72.[43] In 2018, Connolly, now resident in Florida, held his first art exhibition. He stated at the time that he would no longer be touring as a comedian.[44]\n\nPersonal life [ edit ]\n\nConnolly has been married to Pamela Stephenson since 1989\n\nConnolly married Iris Pressagh in 1969. They separated in 1981 and divorced in 1985.\n\nOn 30 December 1985, Connolly became teetotal, having been an alcoholic.[45] ""I don\'t miss drinking. It has taken me by surprise,"" Connolly stated 24 years later.[13] ""I miss the craic. I miss the joy of it all. The headbanging stupidity, the loveliness, the craziness of it. I miss it terribly."" He recalls blackouts that he would fill in upon returning to sobriety. ""Well, [the memories] stopped coming back. But when I drank, I would go, \'Oh, I remember now.\'"" Psychologists call it state-dependent learning.[13] ""That was frightening. I remember thinking, \'Beware, Billy boy. Beware. All is not well. Do something.\'"" Regarding the decision he made to stay sober: ""If [Pamela] goes away, I\'m on my own. There\'s nothing. There\'s only me and it. So the choice becomes very apparent.""[13]\n\nIn 1986, he visited Mozambique to appear in a documentary for Comic Relief. He also featured in the charity\'s inaugural live stage show, both as a stand-up and portraying a willing ""victim"" in his partner Pamela Stephenson\'s act of sawing a man in half to create two dwarfs. Connolly completed his first world tour in 1987, including six nights at the Royal Albert Hall in London, which was documented in the Billy and Albert video. In March 1988, his father died after a stroke, the eighth of his life.[10][18][46] His mother died five years later, in 1993, of motor neurone disease.\n\nConnolly and Stephenson married in Fiji on 20 December 1989: he had been living with her since 1981. ""Marriage to Pam didn\'t change me; it saved me,"" he later said. ""I was going to die. I was on a downwards spiral and enjoying every second of it. Not only was I dying, but I was looking forward to it.""[6]\n\n""It\xe2\x80\x99s up to yourself. You manufacture it [optimism]. You either look at the world one way or another. It\xe2\x80\x99s the old half full half empty. It\xe2\x80\x99s up to you. The world\xe2\x80\x99s a great place, it\xe2\x80\x99s full of great people. The choice is yours. [Pessimism] is a luxury you can\xe2\x80\x99t afford"". \xe2\x80\x94Called an ""optimism nuclear generator"" during a BBC Radio interview in 2019, Connolly on where his optimism comes from.[47]\n\nIn the book Billy (and in a December 2008 online interview), Connolly states he was sexually abused by his father between the ages of ten and fifteen. He believes this was a result of the Catholic Church not allowing his father to divorce after his mother left the family. Because of this, Connolly has a ""deep distrust and dislike of the Catholic church and any other organisation that brainwashes people"".[48] He has called himself an atheist.[49]\n\nIn September 2013, Connolly underwent minor surgery for early-stage prostate cancer.[50] The announcement also stated that he was being treated for the initial symptoms of Parkinson\'s disease.[51] Connolly had acknowledged earlier in 2013 that he had started to forget his lines during performances.[52][53] In January 2019, he disclosed that its advance may force his retirement from performing.[54]\n\nHe appeared on the BBC\'s genealogy programme Who Do You Think You Are? on 2 October 2014, in which he discovered his Indian ancestry.[55][56]\n\nConnolly is father to five children: two from his first marriage and three from his second. He became a grandfather in 2001, when his daughter Cara gave birth to Walter.[6]\n\nAncestry [ edit ]\n\nConnolly\'s paternal grandfather, whom \xe2\x80\x93 like his paternal grandmother \xe2\x80\x93 Connolly never met, was an Irish immigrant who left Ireland when he was ten years old.[57][58][11] His great-great-great grandfather (Charles Mills, a coast guard, 1796\xe2\x80\x931870)[59] and great-great grandfather (Bartholomew Valentine Connolly) were from Connemara.[57]\n\nHis father was William Connolly; his mother, Mary ""Mamie"" McLean, was from the Clan Maclean of Duart Castle on the Isle of Mull on the west coast of Scotland. Mamie\'s father, Neil, was a Protestant and her mother, Flora, was a Roman Catholic who ""made clandestine arrangements for the children to be baptised as Catholics"", even though they were ""formally raised as Protestants"".[57] His maternal grandparents moved inland to Finnieston Street, Glasgow, in the early 1900s.[60]\n\nHis maternal great-great-great-grandfather, John O\'Brien, fought at the Siege of Lucknow during the Indian Rebellion of 1857. He was wounded during the long siege by a severe gunshot to the left shoulder. He married a local 13-year-old Indian girl called Matilda. They had four children and settled in Bangalore after his military service.[55][61]\n\nPolitical views [ edit ]\n\nConnolly had previously been a vocal opponent of Scottish independence. In 1974, he made a political party television broadcast on behalf of the Labour Party which criticised the Scottish National Party. In 1999, he blamed the SNP for a perceived increase in Anglophobia in Scotland; described the new Scottish Parliament as a joke; and declined to attend the opening ceremony.[62]\n\nHe questioned the expense of independence, and whether average Scots would benefit from another level of government, though he added ""Scots are very capable of making up their mind without my tuppence worth.""[63]\n\nIn April 2014, in an interview with the Radio Times leading up to the independence referendum, he stated ""I think it\'s time for people to get together, not split apart. The more people stay together, the happier they\'ll be."" He also referred to the Darien scheme, an effort to establish a Scottish colony in the Isthmus of Panama in 1698; the colony\'s failure destroyed the Kingdom of Scotland\'s economy and led to the Acts of Union in 1707. Connolly wrote, ""You must remember that the Union saved Scotland. Scotland was bankrupt and the English opened us up to their American and Canadian markets, from which we just flowered.""\n\nDuring an interview with the BBC prior to polling day for the Scottish independence referendum on 18 September 2014, Connolly revealed he would not be voting as he was flying to New Zealand that day. He expressed his belief that the people of Scotland did not need his opinion to make up their minds on the subject.[64]\n\nIn October 2018, several media outlets stated that in his book Made in Scotland, released on 10 October, Connolly had voiced his support for independence in light of the 2016 referendum on the United Kingdom leaving the European Union (Brexit), in which Scotland voted to remain. The Times reported Connolly as calling the Brexit vote a ""disaster"" and saying that independence ""may be the way to go"" in order for Scotland to maintain a connection to Europe, leading to speculation that he could be questioning his Unionist beliefs after decades of vehemently opposing independence.[65][66] In Episode Five of the BBC Scotland documentary, Billy and Us, first broadcast on 11 June 2020, he said ""I\'ve never liked nationalism in any of its guises. I\'m not saying I\'ve never agreed with independence. I think a Scottish republic is as good an idea as any I ever heard.""[67]\n\nSupport for charity [ edit ]\n\nConnolly is a patron of the National Association for Bikers with a Disability.[68] He is also a patron of Celtic F.C.\'s The Celtic Foundation.[69]\n\nFolk music [ edit ]\n\n""I\'ll never forget. I was at a Pete Seeger concert in the early 1960s in Glasgow. I\'d just bought a banjo. I\'d seen him on television and I thought \'That\'s what I want to do.\' He was just exquisitely good. He said, \'I would like to sing a song by a new hero of mine, he\'s a young man \xe2\x80\x93 Bob Dylan.\' He sang ""A Hard Rain\'s a-Gonna Fall"". I\'m almost crying at the thought. It was sensational. I became another guy: me. He sang, \'I saw a white man; he was walking a black dog,\' and I thought, \'This is different.\' It changed me forever, in a way I\'ll be eternally grateful for.""[13]\n\nIn 1965, together with Tam Harvey, Connolly started a group called The Humblebums. At their first gig, Connolly reportedly introduced them both to the audience by saying, ""My name\'s Billy Connolly, and I\'m humble. This is Tam Harvey, he\'s a bum."" The band would later include Gerry Rafferty, who saw Connolly at a charity show in Paisley.[70] ""Gerry was very good for me. He taught me that I would never be a musician as long as my arse looked south. He was just so outstandingly good and getting better, and although I was getting better too, the space between us remained huge. He was a real musician, he knew and felt music, a bass player, with a lovely sense of harmony, as well as a great guitarist. I knew tunes and how to play them but that was where my musicianship ended. Unfortunately, I\xe2\x80\x99m still the same to this day. I work very hard, I play every day but I\xe2\x80\x99m still ordinary. I can be flashy, but it\xe2\x80\x99s all tricks really. He\xe2\x80\x99s a musician and I\xe2\x80\x99m just not in the same league. So, I gave up these ambitions and concentrated on what I was really born to do.""[70]\n\nAfter Harvey left the group, Connolly and Rafferty continued as a duo and the latter two of their three albums featured just that duo. Connolly sang, played five-string banjo, guitar, and autoharp, and at live shows entertained the audience with his humorous introductions to the songs.\n\nFrank Bruno and Connolly provided lead vocals on, ""The War Song of the Urpneys"" from The Dreamstone; although the version heard in the series was largely sung by composer Mike Batt.\n\nIn his World Tour of Scotland, Connolly revealed that, at a trailer show during the Edinburgh Festival, the Humblebums took to the stage just before Yehudi Menuhin.\n\nThe Humblebums broke up in 1971 and both Connolly and Rafferty went solo. Connolly\'s first solo album in 1972, Billy Connolly Live! on Transatlantic Records, featured him as a singer-songwriter.\n\nHis early albums were a mixture of comedy performances, with comedic and serious musical interludes. Among his best-known musical performances were ""The Welly Boot Song"", a parody of the Scottish folk song ""The Wark O\' The Weavers,"" which became his theme song for several years; ""In the Brownies"", a parody of the hit Village People songs ""In the Navy"" and ""Y.M.C.A."" (for which Connolly filmed a music video); ""Two Little Boys in Blue"", a tongue-in-cheek indictment of police brutality done to the tune of Rolf Harris\' ""Two Little Boys""; and the ballad, ""I Wish I Was in Glasgow,"" which Connolly would later perform in duet with Malcolm McDowell on a guest appearance on the 1990s American sitcom Pearl (which starred Rhea Perlman). He also performed the occasional Humblebums-era song such as, ""Oh, No!"" as well as straightforward covers such as a version of Dolly Parton\'s, ""Coat of Many Colors"", both of which were included on his Get Right Intae Him! album.\n\nIn November 1975, his spoof of the Tammy Wynette song, ""D-I-V-O-R-C-E"" was a UK No. 1 single for one week. Wynette\'s original was about parents spelling out words of an impending marital split to avoid traumatising their young child. Connolly\'s spoof of the song played on the dog owners using the same tactic to avoid worrying their pet about an impending trip to the vet. Connolly\'s song is about a couple whose marriage is ruined by a bad vet visit (spelling out ""W-O-R-M"" or ""Q-U-A-R-A-N-T-I-N-E"", for example.) His song, ""No Chance"" was a parody of J. J. Barrie\'s cover of the song, ""No Charge"".\n\nIn 1985, he sang the theme song to Super Gran which was released as a single. In 1996, he performed a cover of Ralph McTell\'s ""In the Dreamtime"" as the theme to his World Tour of Australia. By the late 1980s, Connolly had all but dropped the music from his act, though he still records the occasional musical performance, such as a 1980s recording of his composition ""Sergeant, Where\'s Mine?"" with The Dubliners. In 1998, he covered The Beatles\' ""Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!"" on the George Martin tribute album In My Life. He sang the Scottish folk song ""Bonnie George Campbell"" during the film, Lemony Snicket\'s A Series of Unfortunate Events. In 1995 and 2005, he released two albums of instrumental performances, Musical Tour of Scotland and, Billy Connolly\'s Musical Tour of New Zealand, respectively.\n\nConnolly is among the artists featured on Banjoman, a tribute to American folk musician Derroll Adams, released in 2002. He plays one song, ""The Rock"".\n\nStand-up comedy [ edit ]\n\nConnolly during a stand-up show in 2005\n\nConnolly\'s observational comedy is idiosyncratic and often off-the-cuff. He has offended certain sectors of audiences, critics and the media with his free use of the word ""fuck"" and he has made jokes relating to masturbation, blasphemy, defecation, flatulence, haemorrhoids, sex, his father\'s illness, his aunts\' cruelty and, in the latter stages of his career, old age (specifically his experiences of growing old).[71]\n\nIn 2007 and again in 2010, he was voted the greatest stand-up comic on Channel 4\'s 100 Greatest Stand-Ups.[72] He once again topped the list on Channel 5\'s Greatest Stand-Up Comedians, broadcast on New Year\'s Eve 2013.[73]\n\nSince the 1980s, Connolly has worn a custom-made black T-shirt with a shirt-tail as part of his on-stage attire. From 1986 until his death in 2017, his manager was Steve Brown.[74]\n\nComics writing [ edit ]\n\nBetween 1973 and 1977 Connolly wrote a newspaper gag-a-day comic with cartoonist Malky McCormick, titled The Big Yin.[75]\n\nArt [ edit ]\n\nSince 2012, Connolly has released five collections with the UK\'s leading art publisher, Castle Fine Art. Inspired by a rainy day in Montreal, the humorous black-and-white drawings, collectively titled Born on a Rainy Day, have been likened to the cave paintings from the Aurignacian period. His method is similar to that of the Surrealist Automatism movement, whereby the artist allows their hand to move randomly across the paper or canvas without a specific intent. In April 2019, to celebrate World Parkinson\'s Day, his art was projected onto MacLellan\'s Castle in Kirkcudbright. His first sculpture, which is inspired by his past as a welder, was released in March 2020.[76]\n\nDiscography [ edit ]\n\nBelow is a partial list of Connolly\'s solo musical and comedic recordings.

"b'Duck bacon enthusiast Gwyneth Paltrow has taken to Facebook to let the world know she did not enlist the services of a ghostwriter on her 2011 cookbook My Father\'s Daughter. That runs contrary to the version of events given last week in a New York Times essay about the sometimes hard-scrabble literary life of the cookbook ghostwriter by Julia Moskin, who claimed that a writer named Julia Turshen worked in ""collaboration"" with Paltrow on the 2011 title, and apparently will soon be starting work on a second book with the actress. Paltrow suggests Moskin\'s ""facts need checking,"" and claims she wrote ""every word"" of the cookbook. Both accounts do seem like they could be kind of right, and hinge mainly on semantic points about the difference between ghostwriting, collaborating, and just hanging around and helping out. In the author\'s acknowledgements section of My Father\'s Daughter, Paltrow praises, ""the tireless, artful assistance of Julia Turshen, who stood over my shoulder at the stove and chopping block for the better part of a year, bringing a method to my freestyling madness,"" which certainly makes Turshen sound like a valuable member of the team, though not exactly Paltrow\'s Nom de Viking Range. Page Six notes previous articles about the book have credited Turshen as Paltrow\'s ""kitchen assistant,"" which seems fair enough. [Facebook and Page Six]\n\nMay 25. That\'s going to be Beyonc\xc3\xa9\'s first live show since giving birth to registered trademark Blue Ivy Carter. The performance is part of a trio of shows the singer has booked for Atlantic City over Memorial Day. Fans should be delighted, as long as they don\'t accidentally stumble into a roofer\'s conference, instead of the Revel Resort nightclub. [New York Post]\n\nIt sounds like Robert De Niro turned in his least mailed-in performance since Jackie Brown last night during a fundraiser at his Tribeca restaurant Locanda Verde, with First Lady Michelle Obama on-hand as the guest of honor. America\'s greatest living actor even did a little pre-planned bit, telling the crowd in the restaurant\'s back room. ""Callista Gingrich. Karen Santorum. Ann Romney. Now do you really think our country is ready for a white first lady?"" At which point somebody apparently yelled ""No!"" and De Niro responded, ""Too soon, right?"" Hi-larious. Tickets for the 85-person event cost $5,000 and benefitted the Obama Victory Foundation. Other boldfaced names in attendance included Ben Stiller, Gayle King, Harvey Weinstein, Beyonc\xc3\xa9 Knowles, Whoopi Goldberg, Star Jones and Angela Bassett. [Politico]\n\nThere\'s a rumor making the rounds that Jennifer Aniston spends $8,000 a month on various unguents, pumice stones and free-range lip gloss, in order to continue looking like the Jennifer Aniston Americans adored on TV and haven\'t really given much thought to in movies. According to the actress, the $8,000 monthly makeup tab is way off. \xe2\x80\x9cAlthough I am a sucker for an amazing moisturizer, love a great facial, have been using the same cleansing bar since I was a teenager and have always been a dedicated tooth-brusher,"" she told People, ""reports that I am spending eight thousand a month on a beauty regime are greatly exaggerated."" So what\'s a more accurate number? ""By my tally,\xe2\x80\x9d Aniston, \xe2\x80\x9cthis month I\xe2\x80\x99m in for about two hundred bucks."" More reasonable, though we\'d note that is still quite a bit of cheddar and the month is only a little more than halfway done. [People]'"

"b'Ryan Seacrest is breathing a huge sigh of relief. That\xe2\x80\x99s because Kim Kardashian will be filling in for Kelly Ripa for an episode of Kelly and Ryan Live!. This will be Kim\xe2\x80\x99s first time co-hosting with Ryan but her second time on the show. She previously co-hosted Live! with Kelly Ripa back in 2012.\n\nMany viewers believe that there might be some behind-the-scenes friction between Ryan Seacrest and Kelly Ripa. That\xe2\x80\x99s because Ryan might not be focusing on their television show. Even though he\xe2\x80\x99s in New York City every weekday to tape his Live! episodes with Kelly, he\xe2\x80\x99s also hosting his radio show in Los Angeles. If that weren\xe2\x80\x99t enough, Ryan will also be forced to travel to Orlando every week to hot the new reboot of American Idol. With so many different projects, many fans feel that Ryan might be stretching himself too thin.\n\nSooner or later Ryan will be forced to drop one of his gigs. Of course, the last thing Kelly would want to see is him quit Live!. She already spent the last year looking for a suitable replacement for her ex co-host Michael Strahan and she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to spend another year looking for someone to take Ryan\xe2\x80\x99s place, too.\n\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s not the only problem between Ryan and Kelly right now. Many observers also believe there\xe2\x80\x99s also another issue that Kelly might have and that\xe2\x80\x99s with Kim Kardashian. With Kim, fans either absolutely love her or they hate her. There\xe2\x80\x99s no in between. And the last thing Kelly Ripa wants do is alienate her audience. Both Kelly and Ryan have had a hard time keeping audiences tuned in as it is.\n\nThe show\xe2\x80\x99s ratings are nowhere near what it used to be before. And with Kim on the show, it might go one of two ways: either fans will tune in because they\xe2\x80\x99ll want to see if Kim has what it takes to successfully host a show or they\xe2\x80\x99ll tune out altogether. After all, everyone still remembers how Kim\xe2\x80\x99s mother Kris Jenner tried to host her own daytime talk show herself. Her show, Kris, was canceled back in 2013 after one short month on the air.\n\nSo far Ryan Seacrest nor Kelly Ripa have made any comments about Kim Kardashian temporarily joining the show.

"b'Last week, we discussed the incendiary report from an industry insider that says that Kendall Jenner is pregnant and that she\'s been canceling modeling gigs to hide the baby bump.\n\nKendall is the only one of Kris Jenner\'s children to have not yet had a child, so this idea has a lot of people very excited.\n\nBut is she pregnant? Let\'s take a look at the evidence.\n\nReportedly, during a call to set up a modeling shoot, it was confided by a photographer that Kendall Jenner is not modeling at the moment.\n\nShe\'s a supermodel who makes, like, $20 million a year from doing shoots. So that might strike people as odd.\n\nBut the photographer reportedly claimed -- on a private call -- that Kendall is taking this quiet leave of absence because she is pregnant.\n\nWe have stressed from the beginning that this is not confirmed. It\'s not even a firsthand report of hearing the statement.\n\nBut ... some people have pointed out that probably is how something like this would leak.\n\nAs in, not from someone who could be directly traced to the knowledge, but from someone who heard it from a friend or coworker.\n\nIf Kendall really is pregnant, it is widely expected that the baby daddy would be Blake Griffin.\n\nBut many who may hope to see Kendall and Blake produce yet another beautiful grandchild for Kris Jenner to love and monetize, Gossip Cop reports that they have a statement on record from Kendall\'s representative.\n\n""Kendall is not pregnant.""\n\nThat was crushing for many to hear.\n\nAt the same time, some wonder if they should trust an official statement.\n\nAfter all, last year, both Kylie and Khloe were bizarrely coy about their pregnancies for months.\n\nWhile it is totally their right to tell people about their bodies if and when they see fit, a number of fans feels that they are less willing to trust official statements as a result.\n\nSo let\'s look at some clues, instead.\n\nJust a few weeks ago, Kendall Jenner shared this photo.\n\nIn the caption, she writes: ""The party Gods got me.""\n\nWe don\'t think that she\'s announcing to her fans that she was kidnapped by Dionysus and has only just returned from an otherworldly realm of merrymaking.\n\nInstead, and coupled with the photo, this was widely interpreted as an announcement that she was suffering from a major hangover.\n\nHey, it happens.\n\nNaturally, if Kendall were pregnant, one would absolutely hope that she is not drinking anything, let alone drinking enough to give herself a hangover.\n\n(Fetal Alcohol Syndrome is no joke, folks)\n\nAdditionally, Kendall and Blake have been spotted together, out and about.\n\nThat in and of itself has done nothing to quell rumors that they\'re having a child together.\n\nBut those who have seen Kendall have noted that, just as in the recent photos of her that we have pointed out, Kendall is showing no sign of a baby bump.\n\nAdditionally, Kendall has stated recently -- what with all of the chatter about Kylie giving birth to sweet baby Stormi -- that she doesn\'t plan on having any kids until her late twenties.\n\nShe is, again, only 22. This is a very sensible plan on her part.\n\nSo it looks like her flat tummy will be here for years to come.\n\nWe do find ourselves wondering where the claim that she\'s pregnant originated.\n\nDid someone make an offhand remark or a poorly phrased joke that others took seriously?\n\nWe may never know.\n\nWe can only imagine how amazing it would be if Kendall were pregnant with Blake Griffin\'s baby.\n\nAnd we have the perfect name suggestion for her child.\n\nPepsi Griffin.'"
"b'American model and actress\n\nCynthia Ann Crawford (born February 20, 1966) is an American model, actress and businesswoman. Her years of success at modeling made her an international celebrity that have led to roles in television and film as well as other business ventures. During the 1980s and 1990s, Crawford was among the most popular supermodels and a ubiquitous presence on magazine covers, runways, and in fashion campaigns.\n\nEarly life [ edit ]\n\nCynthia Ann Crawford was born in DeKalb, Illinois, on February 20, 1966,[2] the daughter of Dan Crawford and Jennifer Sue Crawford-Moluf (n\xc3\xa9e Walker).[3][4] She has two sisters, Chris and Danielle,[5] as well as a brother, Jeffery, who died of childhood leukemia at age 3.[6] She has stated that her family has been in the United States for generations and that her ancestry is mostly German, English, and French.[7] By appearing in an episode of Who Do You Think You Are? in 2013, she discovered that her ancestors included English nobility and continental royal families of the Middle Ages and that she was descended from Charlemagne.[8]\n\nIn her sophomore year at high school, she received a call from a local clothing store regarding modeling work, only to discover that it was a practical joke set up by two of her classmates. However, the following year another store hired a number of high school girls, including Crawford, to work for them (including a fashion shoot). In her junior year, local photographer Roger Legel, whose duties included photographing a different college girl to be that week\'s coed in the DeKalb Nite Weekly, asked to take her picture for the publication; the result was Crawford\'s first cover.[9] The photo and positive feedback she received were enough to convince her to take up modeling. She entered the Elite Model Management\'s Look of the Year contest at 17 and was the runner-up. Elite Model Management in Chicago then started representing her.\n\nCrawford graduated from DeKalb High School in 1984 as valedictorian.[10] She earned an academic scholarship to study chemical engineering at Northwestern University, which she attended for only one quarter before dropping out in order to pursue a full-time modeling career. After working for photographer Victor Skrebneski in Chicago, Crawford moved to New York City in 1986, and signed with the Elite New York modeling agency.[11]\n\nCareer [ edit ]\n\nDuring the 1980s and 1990s, Crawford was among the most popular supermodels and a ubiquitous presence on magazine covers, runways, and in fashion campaigns. She was repeatedly and frequently featured on the cover of many magazines, including Vogue, W, People, Harper\'s Bazaar, Elle, Cosmopolitan, and Allure. A partial count in 1998 totalled over 500 appearances.[12] Crawford has walked the runways for Chanel, Versace, Dolce & Gabbana, Christian Dior, Calvin Klein, Ralph Lauren, Michael Kors, Todd Oldham, DKNY, and Valentino. Crawford also appeared in many fashion campaigns during her career, including those for Versace, Calvin Klein, Escada, David Yurman, Oscar De La Renta, Balmain, Hermes, Ellen Tracy, Valentino, Bally, Liz Claiborne, Herv\xc3\xa9 Leger, Halston, Anne Klein, Isaac Mizrahi, Blumarine, Guess, Ink, Gap, and Revlon. She has also worked for Omega, Maybelline, Clairol, Pepsi, and Chilean retail stores Ripley (partner of Macy\'s).\n\nIn 1987, Crawford appeared during the opening credits of the Michael J. Fox film The Secret of My Success. Three years later, she appeared alongside top models Christy Turlington, Linda Evangelista, Tatjana Patitz and Naomi Campbell on the cover of the January 1990 edition of British Vogue magazine. Crawford and the other four models subsequently appeared in the video for George Michael\'s hit ""Freedom \'90"" later that year. Subsequently, Crawford played the lost love of Jon Bon Jovi in the 1994 video for his version of ""Please Come Home For Christmas"", ""John Taylor"" in the 2011 video for Duran Duran\'s ""Girl Panic"" (featuring supermodels as the band, including Naomi Campbell as Simon Le Bon), and Headmistress in the 2015 video for Taylor Swift\'s ""Bad Blood"" as part of a cast including Jessica Alba (Domino), Selena Gomez (Arsyn), and fellow models Lily Aldridge, Cara Delevingne, Gigi Hadid, Martha Hunt and Karlie Kloss (as Frostbyte, Mother Chucker, Slay-Z, Homeslice and Knockout respectively).\n\nThe red Versace dress which she wore to the 63rd Academy Awards in 1991 had a major influence on fashion, and many copies and fakes of the dress were produced.[13][14][15] In 1992, Crawford\xe2\x80\x94through GoodTimes Home Video and her company Crawdaddy Productions\xe2\x80\x94made an exercise video with Radu Teodorescu named Cindy Crawford: Shape Your Body; although criticised by some[who?] for being unsafe,[citation needed] it was hugely successful and led to two equally lucrative followups, Cindy Crawford: The Next Challenge in 1993 (again with Radu) and Cindy Crawford: A New Dimension in 2000; the latter, made with fitness expert Kathy Kaehler and produced not long after Crawford gave birth to her first child, was aimed at new mothers getting back into shape. In 2001, Crawford also made a shorter fitness video aimed at children, Mini-Muscles with Cindy Crawford and the Fit-wits, an animated production featuring the voices of Crawford (who also appears at the beginning in live action), Radu and Kobe Bryant.\n\nThe inaugural issue of George, a short lived political magazine in the 1990s, featured Crawford dressed like George Washington on the cover. In 2005, the American Society of Magazine Editors listed it as the 22nd best magazine cover of the last 40 years.[16]\n\nCrawford is 5 feet 9 inches (175 cm) tall[1] with brown hair and eyes. Her measurements are 34\xe2\x80\x9325.5\xe2\x80\x9336"".[17] Crawford\'s trademark is a mole (or ""beauty mark"") above her upper lip. She is so closely associated with this physical feature that she appeared in an Australian advertising campaign for flavoured milk featuring a TV commercial wherein she ""licked off"" her own mole.[18] Her resemblance to model Gia Carangi led her to being known as ""Baby Gia"".[19][20]\n\nCrawford in 1995\n\nCrawford has also been on TV and in films. From 1989 to 1995, Crawford was host and executive producer of MTV\'s House of Style. In the early 1990s, Crawford starred in the Pepsi and Pepsi Stuff advertising.[21][22] In 1992, she appeared in Pepsi\'s Super Bowl commercial,[23] aired during Super Bowl XXVI. In 2016, Pepsi released a remake of the commercial, also featuring Crawford.[23] In 1995, Crawford broke into movies as the female lead in the movie Fair Game. Her performance was panned by critics\xe2\x80\x94Leonard Maltin commented ""In her acting debut, supermodel Crawford makes a good jogger.""[24] The film was also a financial failure, with expenses of $50 million and $11 million takings at the box office. In 2001, she costarred as part of an ensemble cast in The Simian Line. Again the film was not successful or critically acclaimed, but Crawford\'s acting was not criticized. She has had many lesser roles guest starring on TV and as supporting roles, often playing herself. For example, in 2000, she was one of the celebrities (along with Victoria Silvstedt, Anna Falchi and Megan Gale) playing themselves in the Italian comedy Body Guards \xe2\x80\x93 Guardie del corpo. In the 1990s, Carol Shaw, her make-up artist, named a lipstick color after Crawford as a part of the Lorac Cosmetics lip-wear line.[25]\n\nIn July 1988, she posed nude for Playboy magazine in a shoot by photographer Herb Ritts.[26] In October 1998, Crawford returned to the pages of Playboy for a second nude pictorial, again taken by Ritts.[27]\n\nCrawford has consistently ranked highly on lists of the world\'s sexiest people. She was ranked number 5 on Playboy\'s list of the 100 sexiest stars of the 20th century. A 1997 Shape magazine survey of 4,000 picked her as the second (after Demi Moore) most beautiful woman in the world. In 2002, Crawford was named one of the 50 most beautiful people by People magazine. In her forties, she claimed No. 26 in the 2006 Hot 100 issue of Maxim magazine.[28] She was named No. 3 on VH1\'s 40 Hottest Hotties of the 90s and was named one of the ""100 Hottest Women of All-Time"" by Men\'s Health.[29]\n\nAfter modeling [ edit ]\n\nCrawford quit full-time modeling in 2000 and now appears only occasionally in fashion magazines. In 2005, Crawford created a line of beauty products with Jean-Louis Sebagh called Meaningful Beauty for Guthy-Renker.[30] Crawford has stated that she regularly receives certain cosmetic procedures, including Botox and vitamin injections. She first saw a plastic surgeon at the age of 28.[citation needed]\n\nIn 2005, Crawford launched a new line of furniture under the ""Cindy Crawford Home Collection"" name. The collection is manufactured by HM Richards Inc. She assisted in the creation of the line by consulting on the features, colors, or styles that fit the needs of families or reflected her own tastes.[31] She also has a furniture line with Raymour & Flanigan and launched a home goods line with J. C. Penney in late 2009.[32]\n\nCrawford in October 2009\n\nIn 2009, Crawford was one of many celebrities to be photographed by Deborah Anderson for the coffee table book Room 23, produced by philanthropist Diana Jenkins. In addition to appearing in the book, Crawford was the cover model and wrote the dedication.[33]\n\nBecoming, a book about Crawford\'s life and career co-written by Crawford and Katherine O\'Leary, was published in September 2015.[34]\n\nCrawford and her daughter Kaia appeared together on the cover of the April 2016 issue of Vogue Paris.[35] In 2016, she became a spokesperson for Acqua Minerale San Benedetto in Italy.[36]\n\nIn September 2017, Crawford, along with models Claudia Schiffer, Naomi Campbell, Helena Christensen and Carla Bruni, closed the Versace spring/summer 2018 fashion show, which was an homage to the late Gianni Versace.[37]\n\nIn January 2019, Crawford, along with her husband Rande Gerber, Mike Meldman, Jeff Shell, and Jay Sures announced they would purchase the Hollywood deli, Nate \'n Al, to keep its doors open after three generations of family ownership.[38][39]\n\nPersonal life [ edit ]\n\nCrawford was married to actor Richard Gere from 1991 until their divorce in 1995. She married businessman and former model Rande Gerber on May 29, 1998.[40] They have two children, son Presley Walker Gerber (born July 2, 1999)[41] and daughter Kaia Jordan Gerber (born September 3, 2001),[2][42] both of whom went into modeling.[43][44]\n\nActivism and charity work [ edit ]\n\nWhen Crawford was 10 years old, her three-year-old brother Jeff\xe2\x80\x94whom she continues to praise as ""the fourth most influential person in [her] life""\xe2\x80\x94died of leukemia. Since becoming a model, Crawford has made childhood leukemia a focal point of her charity work, donating proceeds of her calendars to medical research.[45] Crawford has been a long-time supporter of the pediatric oncology program at the University of Wisconsin\xe2\x80\x93Madison, where Jeff was treated, stating that she believes he received the best care possible.[46] She is also an honorary board member of the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation.[47]\n\nIn 2007, she became an official supporter of the Ronald McDonald House Charities and is a member of their celebrity board, called the Friends of RMHC.[48] Crawford is on the honorary committee of the California Wildlife Center.[49]\n\nPolitical endorsements [ edit ]\n\nIn 2008, Crawford endorsed Barack Obama for President of the United States.[50] Despite reports, Crawford denied endorsing Mitt Romney for the 2012 election.[51]\n\nFilmography [ edit ]\n\nFilms [ edit ]\n\nVideos [ edit ]\n\nFitness videos [ edit ]\n\nYear Title 1992 Cindy Crawford: Shape Your Body Workout 1993 Cindy Crawford: The Next Challenge Workout 2000 Cindy Crawford: A New Dimension 2001 Mini-Muscles with Cindy Crawford and the Fit-wits\n\nMusic videos [ edit ]\n\nTelevision [ edit ]'"
"b'Beyonce set fans\xe2\x80\x99 tongues wagging all over again about a possible 4th baby when she stepped out in France in a long, stomach-covering gown with Blue Ivy and Jay-Z. See the very suspicious pics here!\n\nIf Beyonce\xe2\x80\x98s not pregnant, she certainly isn\xe2\x80\x99t helping squash the baby rumors! Queen Bey stepped out in Cannes with husband Jay-Z wearing a flowy maxi dress with an empire waist. You know what that means \xe2\x80\x94 it didn\xe2\x80\x99t show an inch of her figure, even her arms. Well, almost everything was covered. The dress was cut totally low and showed off a massive amount of cleavage. She was wearing a pair of sky-high, stripped wedges, which feels like the opposite of what a pregnant woman would wear! However, this is Beyonce we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about; she\xe2\x80\x99s the star who performed in a floating chair at the Grammys while extremely pregnant with twins! SEE PICS OF BEYONCE HIDING HER STOMACH IN A FLOWY DRESS HERE.\n\nPregnancy rumors started when it appeared that Bey gave the audience a sly signal that she was expecting during an On The Run II tour stop in Rome on July 8. In fan footage from the concert, she can be seen briefly rubbing her stomach. Seem familiar? That\xe2\x80\x99s how she gleefully revealed that she was pregnant with daughter Blue Ivy at the 2011 VMAs! She got pretty extra with her second pregnancy announcement, rolling out a full earth mother photoshoot to welcome twins Sir and Rumi in 2017, but maybe she\xe2\x80\x99s going low key again! Not to mention, Beyonce was also recently spotted walking around Europe with a large purse strategically covering her stomach. Slick!\n\nYou know how much the Carters love the number four, right? Beyonce was born on September 4 while Jay-Z was born on December 4. They got married on April 4, 2008. Beyonce released an album called 4 in 2011, and Jay-Z released 4:44 in 2017! It only makes sense that they welcome a fourth child into the world, too!\n\nAt the end of June, Beyonce wore a skintight outfit in concert that showcased a totally flat tummy. But we all know how quickly things can change in three weeks! She may be showing the first hints of a baby bump at this point. We can\xe2\x80\x99t wait to see!'"
"b'The past couple months have been devastating for anyone who follows the love lives of the Hollywood elite. Iconic couples \xe2\x80\x94 from Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan to John Cena and Nikki Bella \xe2\x80\x94 have been calling it quits left and right. And this morning, Twitter was on fire with speculation that another famous couple was on the way to Splitsville \xe2\x80\x94 Victoria and David Beckham! *GASP* What? Noooooo. So, are David and Victoria Beckham divorcing? The answer is no, according to a statement David\'s rep gave to Mirror Online.\n\n""There is no statement due or divorce,"" the rep said, slamming the rumors with one sentence. ""This is just fake social media news. This is all very bizarre and an embarrassing waste of time."" Elite Daily reached out to David\'s team for comment on the report, but did not hear back by the time of publication.\n\nHow did these rumors start? Well, does it really matter? It seems like rumors that David and Victoria are divorcing pop up every other year. So it seems we\'re right on schedule.\n\nBut, just for your information, it seems the spark that lit the fire under this round of speculation came when whispers that David was cheating on Victoria with their daughter, Harper\'s, teacher (and that she\'s supposedly now pregnant with his child) hit Twitter. Elite Daily reached out to David and Victoria\'s teams for comment on the cheating rumors, but did not hear back by the time of publication.\n\nAccording to Mirror Online, ""bookies suspended betting on news of them splitting following thousands of tweets claiming the couple would be putting out a statement."" Which, is, like, the saddest sentence I\'ve ever read. Who bets on the downfall of someone\'s marriage?! Come on now. Be better.\n\nTwitter is currently freaking out.\n\nBut the denial from David\'s rep is pretty strong. And if you\'ve been keeping an eye on the Beckham\'s social media pages, Victoria made things pretty clear in the early hours of June 8 when speculation was running rampant on Twitter, that she and David are totally and utterly fine. She shared a photo cuddling with Harper and captioned it, ""Morning cuddles x So much love \xf0\x9f\x99\x8f\xf0\x9f\x8f\xbb We love and miss u @davidbeckham \xf0\x9f\x92\x95\xf0\x9f\x92\x95\xf0\x9f\x92\x95\xf0\x9f\x92\x95.""\n\nCan we crown Victoria the queen of sub-Instagramming right here and now? I mean, there\'s so much going on in this Instagram. Like, first of all, she\'s cuddling with Harper, her daughter whose teacher is being wrapped up in all this drama. And then, she tagged her hubby and said she misses him hardcore, which, I assume, she wouldn\'t have said he was a lowdown, good-for-nothing cheater.\n\nAnyway, like I said, this couple is no stranger to divorce rumors. Back in February 2017, when they were dealing with rumors that they were only together because of their bazillion-dollar brand (see a pattern here?), David shut them down hard.\n\nIn February, David told BBC Radio listeners,\n\nOf course, you make mistakes over the years, and we all know marriage is difficult at times. It\'s about working through it. We know each other better than anybody. People have talked about, \'Do we stay together because it\'s a brand?\' Of course not. We stay together because we love each other, because we have four amazing children.\n\nAt the end of the day, David and Victoria have been happily married for 19 years and have four amazing children together: Brooklyn (19), Romeo (15), Cruz (13), and Harper (6).\n\nAnd, for the record, Victoria never runs out of beautiful things to say about her soccer-star husband, either.\n\nBack in 2017, the former Spice Girl told Today host Savannah Guthrie,\n\nI\'m lucky that David is the most fantastic father and husband, and he\'s great. We\'re very equal at home, and we\'re a really, really good team\xe2\x80\xa6 He\'s the most incredible husband, fantastic father. He inspires me every day. Not just seeing him with the children and how he treats me. It just works. We\'re lucky to have each other.\n\nWatch her gushing about David below:\n\nNow, can y\'all just let these perfect angels be happy?'"
"b""All the pregnancy accusations are just as bad as fat shaming, FYI.\n\ntheres nothing wrong with Rihanna being pregnant, but its kind of rude to assume it bc shes gained some weight. you wouldnt go up to a heavier set woman and ask when shes due bc it\xe2\x80\x99s disrespectful, so why do it to Rih knowing her weight is already an insecurity of hers?\n\nThere's obviously nothing wrong with being pregnant, and if Rihanna truly is carrying a baby, then that's great! However, calling a woman pregnant \xe2\x80\x94 or assuming she is because of some kooky signs or because she's covering up her stomach \xe2\x80\x94 is body shaming.\n\nAlso, just because Rihanna wore an outfit that covered her midsection doesn't automatically confirm a pregnancy. No one is entitled to her body, and she can cover it up should she want to."""

"b'Remember when Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux announced their split, just a week after Architectural Digest published a story with photos of their gorgeous midcentury Los Angeles home? It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t so bad on the scale of celebrity breakups, but after less than three years of marriage (a lifetime in Hollywood), it was a tabloid downer for a day or two.\n\nIn case there are still people busying themselves wondering if Aniston is happy (just a note, she really doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want you to), please stop. According to the latest tabloid reports, she\xe2\x80\x99s doing just fine. She\xe2\x80\x99s reportedly back on the dating scene with two different beaus, per Us Weekly, and her friends are having trouble not talking about it.

He has committed to raising $500,000-plus for the president\xe2\x80\x99s re-election. \xe2\x80\x9cI\'m disillusioned by the people who are disillusioned by Obama,\xe2\x80\x9d Clooney recently told ABC News.\n\nUPDATED: More reporting has determined that the actor is not selling his lakeside Lake Como property.\n\nROME \xe2\x80\x93 The Hollywood Reporter updated this report with confirmation from George Clooney that the actor is not selling his Lake Como property.\n\nPreviously:\n\nIt looks like actor and Italy regular George Clooney may be severing his ties with the Bel Paese, at least according to a report from Italian news program TG 24.\n\nThe report said that Clooney is looking to sell Villa Oleandra, the mansion he bought on the shores of Lake Como 10 years ago, in order to distance himself from the attention of the corps of paparazzi who follow his every move while there.\n\nIf the reports prove to be true, it would be part of a dramatic withdrawal from Italy for the 51-year-old Clooney, who has established deep roots in the country.\n\nTwo years after buying Villa Oleandra, Clooney was made an honorary citizen of Laglio, the town where his villa is located.\n\nSTORY: THR Presents the Clooney Award: TV Stars Who Can Make the Leap\n\nHe also made his 2010 film The American in Italy after promising residents of the earthquake-stricken Abruzzo region he would make a film there in order to help boost the local economy, and he was an almost annual visitor to the Venice Film Festival. His political drama The Ides of March opened the festival a year ago.\n\nAdditionally, Clooney was connected romantically with Italian actress Elisabetta Canalis for nearly five years.\n\nBut the relationship with Canalis ended last year. And Marco Mueller, the Venice artistic director who regularly invited Clooney to the Venice Lido was ousted from the job in December and replaced by Alberto Barbera, who has said that Venice under Mueller was ""in a rut"" with the same people appearing every year -- perhaps an indication that the storied festival would not rush to invite Clooney back again so soon. He is not scheduled to appear at this year\'s edition of the Venice festival, which gets underay Wednesday.\n\nSTORY: President and Michelle Obama: George Clooney Is a \'Wonderful Guy\' and \'Cute, Too\'\n\nThe issue with Villa Oleandra concerns privacy -- or the lack of it, due to the scrum of paparazzi photographers camped outside the villa when Clooney is there. According to TG 24, the intrusiveness of the photographers got to the point where Stacy Keibler, Clooney\xe2\x80\x99s current girlfriend, gave Clooney an ultimatum: ""Villa Oleandra or me.""\n\nThe news program quoted some of the paparazzi, who said they had done no wrong. ""None of us has received any legal notice and nobody has broken the law,"" the program quoted photographer Pierpaolo Ferreri as saying. ""Clooney is a public figure. We stay out of the house and try to photograph him when he comes out. What\xe2\x80\x99s wrong with that?

However, James\xe2\x80\x99 claims prove that Charles is actually Harry\xe2\x80\x99s father (Phew!).\n\nJames reflected on his and Diana\xe2\x80\x99s whirlwind and private romance. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a gradual period and then, you know, suddenly you can\xe2\x80\x99t get enough of each other or see each other as much as you want,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, adding they had some great, low-key times together. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d cook and she\xe2\x80\x99d wash up. Just dinner and relaxing and laughing.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTheir affair was soon exposed by the press, which led to their eventual split. Diana and Charles \xe2\x80\x94 who are also parents to a 35-year-old son, Prince William \xe2\x80\x94 later divorced in 1996 after 15 years of marriage. Diana died in a car crash in August 1997.\n\nWhile Harry has expressed in the past that he\xe2\x80\x99s close with his dad, the red-headed royal also had a strong bond with his late mother and recently revealed how he\xe2\x80\x99s keeping her legacy alive through his charity work. \xe2\x80\x9cI want to do something that makes my mother proud,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cLucky for me I\xe2\x80\x99ve got the prince bit so I\xe2\x80\x99m able to make a difference.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nJoin our Facebook group for the latest updates on Kate Middleton, Prince William, and all things royal!'"
"b'It\'s been over a year since we first learned that Sofia Richie is dating Scott Disick.\n\nIt\'s one of those relationships that\'s tough to wrap your head around, and not just because of the massive age gap.\n\nSure, Scott is 15 years Sofia\'s senior, but that wouldn\'t be so strange if they were 40 and 55.\n\nAt 20 and 35, however, it\'s a little odd.\n\nHere, we have a woman who can\'t even legally purchase a cocktail in a serious relationship with a man who has three kids by his baby mama -- who\'s been famous since Sofia was in grade school.\n\nIt\'s an unusual situation, to put it mildly.\n\nAnd now that Kourtney Kardashian has dumped Younes Bendjima, the whole scenario might get even weirder.\n\nYou see, rumor has it that Sofia feels threatened by Kourtney.\n\nSources say she\'s constantly worried about Scott leaving her to try and make his family whole again.\n\nAnd now that Kourtney is back on the market, her concerns might be justified.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSofia is furious that Scott and Kourtney are hanging out again,\xe2\x80\x9d one insider tells In Touch Weekly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe understands that they have to remain civil for the kids but has become convinced that Kourtney is trying to steal back her man.""\n\nSofia is reportedly so worried about the situation that she\'s taken steps to try and ensure that\n\n""She recently reached out to her and told her to back off,"" says the source.\n\nAs for the Lord himself, it seems Scott feels that he\'s stuck between a rock and a hard place.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cScott\xe2\x80\x99s caught in the middle,\xe2\x80\x9d the insider claims.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe loves Sofia but will always have a soft spot for Kourtney.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThose who know Scott best say that as much as he\'s enamored with Sofia, those feelings will eventually go stale, and he\'ll come running back to Kourtney.\n\nIn fact, Scott recently revealed that he\'s considered reconciling with Kourtney.\n\n""We always said we\'d try to get back together when we\'re 40,"" he said on an episode of Keeping Up With the Kardashians.\n\nConsidering Kourtney is currently 39, Sofia may have real cause for concern.\n\nHopefully, if the relationship fizzles, she\'ll quickly realize she dodged a bullet by not ending up with Scott.'"

Following her mother\xe2\x80\x99s death, one of Dow\xe2\x80\x99s caregiver says she was there for many of the fights between the two and now she\xe2\x80\x99s going to share what she heard and knows in a new book, according to In Touch Weekly. (RELATED: Jennifer Aniston UNLOADS On The Media For Speculating That She\xe2\x80\x99s Pregnant)\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe caregiver was present for the few phone calls and even fewer meetings between Jen and Nancy,\xe2\x80\x9d a source told the outlet. \xe2\x80\x9cShe wants to expose the real Jennifer Aniston.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNancy was so sick and lonely,\xe2\x80\x9d the source said according to another report. \xe2\x80\x9cEveryone knows that she and Nancy had a horrible relationship.

"b'American magazine publishing company\n\nAmerican Media, Inc. (AMI) is an American publisher of magazines, supermarket tabloids, and books based in New York City. Originally affiliated with only the National Enquirer, the media company\'s holdings expanded considerably in the 1990s and 2000s. In November 2010, American Media filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection due to debts of nearly $1 billion, but has continued to buy and sell magazine brands since then.\n\nAMI has been in the news affiliated with accusations of catch and kill operations. On December 12, 2018, the U.S. Attorney\'s Office reported that AMI admitted to paying $150,000 to Karen McDougal in concert with a candidate\'s presidential campaign for the sole purpose of preventing damaging allegations prior to the 2016 US presidential election.[2][3]\n\nAccording to its September 2018 non-prosecution agreement with Southern District of New York federal prosecutors, AMI ""shall commit no crimes whatsoever"" for three years, otherwise ""A.M.I. shall thereafter be subject to prosecution for any federal criminal violation of which this office has knowledge.""[4]\n\nOn April 10, 2019, Chatham Asset Management, which controls 80 percent of AMI\'s stock, forced AMI to sell the National Enquirer.[5][6] This came after Chatham owner Anthony Melchiorre, who AMI has also relied on for survival, expressed dismay over the tabloid magazine\'s recent scandals involving hush money assistance to U.S. President Donald Trump\'s 2016 campaign and blackmail of Jeff Bezos.[5][6] On April 18, 2019, AMI agreed to sell not only the National Enquirer, but two of its other publications, Globe and National Examiner, to Hudson Group.[7][8]\n\nHistory [ edit ]\n\nThe modern American Media came into being after Generoso Pope Jr., longtime owner of the National Enquirer, died in 1988, and his tabloids came under new ownership. American tabloids began consolidating in 1990, when American Media bought Star from Rupert Murdoch. The purchase of Globe Communications (owner of the Globe and the National Examiner) followed nine years later.[9] Roger Altman, through Evercore Partners, bought a controlling stake in American Media in 1999.[10]\n\nAmerican Media is not to be confused with American Media Distribution the international news coverage firm. American Media\'s former corporate headquarters in Boca Raton, Florida, figured prominently in news headlines in late 2001, after an anthrax attack was perpetrated on the company[11] and other media outlets.[12] Since then the corporate headquarters have moved to New York City at 1 Park Avenue in Manhattan, before moving to the Financial District to the former JP Morgan Chase headquarters at 4 New York Plaza. That building was severely damaged by Hurricane Sandy but reopened in February 2013. The CEO, David J. Pecker, travels between the Boca Raton and New York offices while managing the company.[citation needed]\n\nAMI continued to expand after it bought Joe Weider\'s Weider Publications in 2002. Joe Weider continued to manage control of his magazines under AMI\'s Weider Publications subsidiary until his death in March 2013.[13][14]\n\nAmerican Media also owns Distribution Services, an in-store magazine merchandising company. In fall 2002, it launched the book-publishing imprint, AMI Books.[15]\n\n2010s: Bankruptcy and continued acquisitions [ edit ]\n\nIn 2009, American Media was taken over by its bondholders to keep it out of bankruptcy.[16]\n\nIn November 2010, American Media filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection due to nearly $1 billion in debt, and assets of less than $50,000.[17] Its subsidiary, American Media Operations Inc., listed assets of $100 to $500 million and debt of over $1 billion.[18] It exited in December.\n\nIn May 2014, American Media announced a decision to shift the headquarters of the National Enquirer from Florida, where it had been located since 1971, back to New York City, where it originally began as The New York Enquirer in 1926.[19] In August 2014, American Media was acquired by Chatham Asset Management and Omega Charitable Partnership[20].[21]\n\nIn 2015, American Media sold Shape, Natural Health, and Fit Pregnancy to Meredith.[22]\n\nIn 2016, Pecker revealed to the Toronto Star that AMI now relied on support from Chatham Asset Management and its owner Anthony Melchiorre.[23][6] The $4 billion hedge fund owns 80 percent of AMI\'s stock.[6]\n\nIn March 2017, American Media acquired Us Weekly from Wenner Media for a reported $100 million.[24] Three months later, in June 2017, American Media also acquired Men\'s Journal from Wenner Media.[25]\n\nIn June 2018, American Media acquired 13 brands from Bauer Media Group including In Touch Weekly, Life & Style and Closer to add to their celebrity portfolio. They also acquired Bauer Media\'s kids group including J-14 and Girl\'s World.[26]\n\nIn February 2019, American Media acquired TEN\'s adventure sports properties.[27]\n\nIn April 2019, the National Enquirer was reported to be up for sale and likely to be sold within days. The company stated that it had shifted its emphasis away from tabloids to its ""glossy"" magazines such as Us Weekly and Men\'s Journal.[28] This came following pressure from Chatham owner Anthony Melchiorre, who expressed disapproval of the Enquirer\'s style of journalism.[6][5] On April 18, 2019, AMI accepted an offer from Hudson News head James Cohen and agreed to sell not only the National Enquirer, but also Globe and The Examiner to Hudson News for $100 million.[7][8] At the time the sales were announced, AMI was approximately $355 million in debt.[29]\n\n""Catch-and-kill"" scandals related to Donald Trump [ edit ]\n\nIn late 2015, AMI paid $30,000 to Dino Sajudin, a doorman at Trump Tower, to obtain the rights to his story in which he alleged Donald Trump had an affair in the 1980s that resulted in the birth of a child. Sajudin in April 2018 identified the woman as Trump\'s former housekeeper.[30] AMI reporters were given the names of the woman and the alleged child, while Sajudin passed a lie detector test when testifying that he had heard the story from others. Shortly after the payment was made, Pecker ordered the reporters to drop the story.[31] In April 2018, AMI chief content officer Dylan Howard denied the story was ""spiked"" in a so-called ""catch and kill"" operation, insisting that AMI did not run the story because Sajudin\'s story lacked credibility.[32] On August 24, 2018, after AMI had released Sajudin from the contract, CNN obtained a copy of it and published excerpts. The contract instructed Sajudin to provide ""information regarding Donald Trump\'s illegitimate child,"" but did not contain further specifics of Sajudin\'s story.[33]\n\nKaren McDougal [ edit ]\n\nAmerican Media Inc. Non-Prosecution Agreement\n\nIn 2016, AMI paid Playboy model Karen McDougal $150,000 for exclusive rights to her allegations of a ten-month affair with Donald Trump\xe2\x80\x94which she claimed happened in 2006\xe2\x80\x932007, when he was already married to Melania[34]\xe2\x80\x94but AMI never published the story. AMI publicly acknowledged having made the payment after The Wall Street Journal revealed it days before the 2016 presidential election, but AMI denied that its purpose had been to ""kill damaging stories about"" Trump; instead, AMI claimed it had paid only for ""exclusive life rights to any relationship [McDougal] has had with a then-married man"" and ""two years\' worth of her fitness columns and magazine covers.""[35][36] In March 2018, McDougal filed a lawsuit to invalidate the non-disclosure agreement she had with AMI.[37][38] A month later, AMI settled with McDougal, allowing her to speak about the alleged affair.[39] In August 2018, it was reported that AMI CEO/Chairman David Pecker and AMI chief content officer Dylan Howard were granted witness immunity in exchange for their testimony regarding hush money payments made by Donald Trump\'s then-personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, in an attempt to influence the 2016 presidential election.[40]\n\nOn December 12, 2018, the U.S. Attorney\'s Office announced its agreement with AMI ""AMI admitted that it made the $150,000 payment in concert with a candidate\'s presidential campaign,"" the press release said, so that Karen McDougal wouldn\'t ""publicize damaging allegations about the candidate before the 2016 presidential election. AMI further admitted that its principal purpose in making the payment was to suppress the woman\'s story so as to prevent it from influencing the election."" As a result of this agreement, AMI would not face prosecution and agreed to provide extensive assistance to prosecutors about the involvement of Trump and other politicians with the company.[2] The same press release also revealed that Michael Cohen had been sentenced to three years in prison for various crimes, including the $150,000 campaign finance violation\xe2\x80\x94the facilitation of the payment to McDougal\xe2\x80\x94to which he pled guilty on August 21, 2018.[41][42][43]\n\nJeff Bezos blackmail [ edit ]\n\nIn January 2019, the National Enquirer broke a story about the extramarital affair of Amazon founder and Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos with Lauren S\xc3\xa1nchez. Bezos began investigating how and why the information had been leaked to the National Enquirer.[44] President Trump has long expressed displeasure with Bezos,[45][46][47] and Trump\'s irritation may have increased due to the Washington Post\'s critical coverage of the murder (and the subsequent cover-up[48]) of one of its reporters, Jamal Khashoggi.[49] This, Bezos suspects, may have been the political motivation for someone to leak his affair to the tabloid.[50]\n\nOn February 7, 2019, Bezos shared emails that he had received the previous day[50] in which AMI sought a public statement from him and his lawyer ""affirming that they have no knowledge or basis for suggesting that AM\'s coverage [of the sexual affair] was politically motivated or influenced by political forces, and an agreement that they will cease referring to such a possibility."" AMI chief content officer Dylan Howard and his lawyer Jon Fine threatened Bezos, saying that if Bezos did not promptly meet their demands, AMI would publish selfies and sexts sent between Bezos and his girlfriend.[51] Bezos wrote that he would refuse to make this ""specific lie"" or to otherwise participate in this blackmail bargain that ""no real journalists [would] ever propose.""[50] ""Of course I don\'t want personal photos published,"" Bezos added, but he said he chooses to ""stand up, roll this log over, and see what crawls out.""\n\nThat same day, The Washington Post published an article on the matter, quoting a former federal prosecutor who speculated that this news could undermine AMI\'s recent deal with the government. If prosecutors decide they must file new criminal charges against AMI, the government may not be able ""to continue to use them [AMI] to assist other ongoing investigations,"" said Robert Mintz.[52]\n\nLauren Sanchez\'s brother, Michael Sanchez, an ardent Trump supporter, stated he was told by multiple AMI employees that the Enquirer set out to do ""a takedown to make Trump happy""[53] and The Daily Beast reported seeing documents showing that Sanchez believed the Bezos story was run with ""President Trump\'s knowledge and appreciation.""[54]\n\nPublications [ edit ]\n\nDivisions [ edit ]\n\nAMI Books\n\nAMI Entertainment Group [55] [56]\n\nDistribution Services, Inc.\n\nDew Tour\n\nSee also [ edit ]'"
"b'Johnny Depp\xe2\x80\x99s bad boy persona used to help sell the movies he made. He was a real life Capt. Jack Sparrow, who could hit the press circuit armed with a few rococo anecdotes, delivered with a rock \xe2\x80\x98n roll edge in between drags of freshly rolled cigarettes. His act was charming and his mystique undeniable.\n\nNo longer. A new Rolling Stone profile of the actor compares Depp\xe2\x80\x99s current, debauched existence to Elvis\xe2\x80\x99s last, drug-fueled days. It left readers and people in Hollywood alarmed with its portrayal of Depp, a 55-year-old man, drinking goblet after goblet of vintage red wine, smoking hash, and, it is heavily implied, partaking in even stronger substances, all while cordoned off in a gated mansion that leaves him cut off from reality.\n\nStudios still in business with the actor were poring over the profile this morning, assessing what \xe2\x80\x94 if any \xe2\x80\x94 fallout there would be from the piece. At a minimum, it\xe2\x80\x99s a major distraction for the backers of Depp\xe2\x80\x99s upcoming films \xe2\x80\x94 a list that includes Global Road\xe2\x80\x99s September crime drama \xe2\x80\x9cCity of Lies\xe2\x80\x9d and Warner Bros. big-budget \xe2\x80\x9cFantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald.\xe2\x80\x9d Spokespeople for both studios declined to comment, and a spokesperson for Depp did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe truth is that even before the Rolling Stone article hit stands, Depp has been widely viewed as a liability. He is out of step with the #MeToo and Time\xe2\x80\x99s Up movements after being accused by ex-wife Amber Heard of domestic assault. The backlash to those allegations has been so intense that J.K. Rowling felt moved to defend casting the actor in \xe2\x80\x9cFantastic Beasts\xe2\x80\x9d nearly a year before the film even hit theaters.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBased on our understanding of the circumstances, the filmmakers and I are not only comfortable sticking with our original casting but genuinely happy to have Johnny playing a major character in the movies,\xe2\x80\x9d Rowling said in a statement.\n\nAnd his legal battle with his former business managers has laid bare embarrassing spending details and, worse yet, exposed him as an actor in desperate need of paycheck roles to fund a lifestyle he can no longer afford. Studios want Depp to share a few choice on-set memories, not expose him to a grilling about his stormy personal life.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis baggage is a huge concern,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeff Bock, a box office analyst with Exhibitor Relations. \xe2\x80\x9cPart of the reason to hire an A-list actor is so they can hit the talk- show circuit and travel around the world promoting a film. That might not be possible now.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIt also means that Depp\xe2\x80\x99s co-stars will now have to deflect questions about the actor\xe2\x80\x99s behavior when they go out to talk up the films.\n\nThe Rolling Stone story may have set off alarms, but an individual with knowledge of the \xe2\x80\x9cFantastic Beasts\xe2\x80\x9d production said the portrait it presented of a zonked- out movie star was not in keeping with Depp\xe2\x80\x99s on-set behavior. He was on time, knew his lines, and was courteous to cast and crew.\n\nIt is also true that unlike indefatigable promoters such as Tom Cruise and Will Smith, Depp tends to be more sparing in his press appearances. He will traditionally only do a few magazine profiles, often with favored outlets such as Vanity Fair, and a handful of on-camera interviews.\n\nDepp isn\xe2\x80\x99t the only actor whose off-screen behavior is causing headaches for studios these days. Vertical Entertainment is moving ahead with the August release of \xe2\x80\x9cBillionaire Boys Club,\xe2\x80\x9d despite the presence of Kevin Spacey, an actor accused of harassing and assaulting several men, some of whom were underage.\n\nAmazon still has to figure out what to do with \xe2\x80\x9cA Rainy Day in New York,\xe2\x80\x9d an upcoming Woody Allen movie. The director has become toxic as allegations that he assaulted his daughter, Dylan Farrow, have received more media coverage since Hollywood has been battling an industry-wide sexual harassment crisis. Several of the films stars, a group that includes Timoth\xc3\xa9e Chalamet and Rebecca Hall, have donated their salaries to charity and expressed regret for working on the film. Amazon has yet to announce a release date for the picture, which doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem like a show of confidence.\n\nAnd earlier this week, Peter Fonda attracted a wave of bad publicity after tweeting that Barron Trump should be ripped from his mother\xe2\x80\x99s arms while calling out the Trump administration\xe2\x80\x99s family separation policy. Sony Pictures Classics, the distributor of Fonda\xe2\x80\x99s next film \xe2\x80\x9cBoundaries,\xe2\x80\x9d said it had no plans to delay or cancel the movie\xe2\x80\x99s debut this weekend, but it did denounce his comments.\n\nDepp plays the lead role in \xe2\x80\x9cCity of Lies,\xe2\x80\x9d a drama about the murders of Tupac Shakur and The Notorious B.I.G., so he\xe2\x80\x99s front-and-center in the marketing material. \xe2\x80\x9cFantastic Beasts,\xe2\x80\x9d however, is another story. Because Depp plays a villainous supporting role, the studio never planned for him to be heavily involved in hawking the film. Trailers and posters don\xe2\x80\x99t exactly hide Depp\xe2\x80\x99s involvement, but they don\xe2\x80\x99t trumpet it either. Warner Bros. hasn\xe2\x80\x99t ruled out asking the actor to participate in interviews for the film, but nothing definitive has been set in place. He is also intended to be a part of the third \xe2\x80\x9cFantastic Beasts\xe2\x80\x9d film, but that could theoretically change because Rowling has yet to deliver the script.\n\nDepp\xe2\x80\x99s other forthcoming big-budget movie, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Invisible Man,\xe2\x80\x9d appears to be stuck in development limbo. It was intended to be part of an effort to relaunch Universal\xe2\x80\x99s iconic movie monsters, but those plans had to be reworked after the first film in that proposed cinematic universe, 2017\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cThe Mummy,\xe2\x80\x9d bombed at the box office.\n\nThe Rolling Stone story, which portrays Depp engaging in a deeply unhealthy lifestyle, could potentially lead to trouble with insurance companies that bond the actor\xe2\x80\x99s productions. Actors such as Robert Downey Jr., who famously struggled with drug and alcohol addiction, had insurance headaches before cleaning up their acts. Of course, Downey\xe2\x80\x99s drug problems landed him in prison, making his issues more extreme.\n\nAll of these Depp-related headaches come while the actor\xe2\x80\x99s box office powers appear to be waning. Recent Depp vehicles such as \xe2\x80\x9cBlack Mass\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cAlice Through the Looking Glass\xe2\x80\x9d were financial duds, and last summer\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cPirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales\xe2\x80\x9d was the second-lowest grossing film in the franchise.\n\nThat may be Depp\xe2\x80\x99s biggest crime.

"b'Below, check out a play by play of the couple\'s relationship -- at least, the parts that have been seen through the public eye. December 2010: It All Started With Pancakes They first met in 2009. A year later, when Bieber was 16 and Gomez was 18, the two apparently shared a meal and some laughs -- and maybe took part in some hand-holding? -- at an IHOP in Philadelphia. Gomez apparently exclaimed to US that ""it was just pancakes!"" but a week later, they were seen together again by Bieber\'s tour bus in Miami, where he had a concert. Those who were really paying attention noticed Bieber had his arm placed on Gomez\'s back. Bieber brushed it off by calling Gomez ""an amazing person"" and telling MTV he was ""just having fun being a teenager."" January 2011: Caught Kissing in the Caribbean The young maybe-lovebirds still weren\'t saying a thing about their rumored relationship, but the pictures said plenty. Gomez and Bieber were photographed on vacation together, kissing and embracing on a private yacht in St. Lucia. February 2011: Holding Hands & Going Red Carpet Official After being photographed together again, this time hand in hand in Santa Monica, Calif., the new teen idol couple made their first real appearance together at a Vanity Fair after-party for the 2011 Oscars in Hollywood. Bieber looked sharp in a black suit, while Gomez turned heads in a stunning red gown -- but more importantly, they arrived arm in arm on the party\'s red carpet.\n\nGeorge Pimentel/WireImage Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber arrive at the Vanity Fair Oscar party hosted by Graydon Carter held at Sunset Tower on Feb. 27, 2011 in West Hollywood, Calif.\n\nSelena Gomez and Justin Bieber arrives at the Vanity Fair Oscar Party at the Sunset Tower in Los Angeles on Feb. 27, 2011. AP Photo/Carlo Allegri March 2011: Thanks to Ellen, Selena Will Never Spend a Night Alone There was no denying she was dating Bieber by now, so Gomez was a good sport when Ellen DeGeneres teased the singer about their relationship. In fact, she even accepted a very special gift from the daytime talk show host: a pillow with her boyfriend\'s face. ""He\'s gonna make me sleep with this every night,"" she admitted.\n\nMay 2011: Smooching at the Billboard Music Awards At the 2011 Billboard Music Awards, Gomez and Bieber were seen sharing some PDA yet again, this time with a kiss. Things were still sweet a few months into their budding romance. September 2011: A Romantic Date Alone ... At the Staples Center In a grand gesture, Bieber planned a kind of night out with his girlfriend that\'s not easily replicated. The two had the entire Staples Center to themselves, where they apparently enjoyed a private viewing of Titanic. \xe2\x80\x9cRomance isn\xe2\x80\x99t dead,\xe2\x80\x9d Bieber tweeted after their romantic date. \xe2\x80\x9cTreat your lady right fellas.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nFebruary 2012: Diamonds for Valentine\'s Day Around the time of Valentine\'s Day in 2012, Gomez showed off a new sparkly ring in a photo on Twitter. The ring appeared to be made up of diamonds shaped in the letter \'J,\' and her hand was being held by (one can only guess) Bieber. ""I\'m finally home,"" she tweeted along with the picture. April 2012: Selena\'s \'Humiliating\' Kiss Cam Moment The couple\'s outing to a Lakers game ended up majorly embarrassing Gomez, after their faces showed up on the kiss cam and they found themselves obligated to, you know, kiss. \xe2\x80\x9cOh God, that was probably the most humiliating thing that\xe2\x80\x99s ever happened to me,\xe2\x80\x9d she told Ryan Seacrest. \xe2\x80\x9cWe were watching and I thought it was funny, and they were showing little elderly couples and it was so cute. And all of a sudden we\xe2\x80\x99re both looking up and we come on [the screen] and it\xe2\x80\x99s like\xe2\x80\xa6 it was so awkward. It was so weird. I mean you have to kiss, right?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNovember 2012: Selena & Justin Break Up The Associated Press confirmed Gomez and Bieber went their separate ways, with other outlets reporting that ""distance"" and ""busy schedules"" were the reason for the split heard \'round the pop world. April 2013: A Snuggly Snapshot Rumors swirled about the couple revisiting their romance, but some seemingly concrete evidence came when Bieber shared a shirtless Instagram photo in which he was being embraced by his ex. ""\'You\'ve been makin music for too long babe come cuddle\' -her,"" he captioned the picture. May 2013: A GIFable Moment After another awards show round, a brief backstage happening made its rounds around the internet. Gomez and Bieber were spotted sharing a quick kiss. Meanwhile, Gomez\'s bestie Taylor Swift reacted to the scene by turning away and sticking her tongue out.\n\nJanuary 2014: Some Quality Time Together After a quiet period, the pair was spotted by TMZ casually riding Segways together in Calabasas. Bieber also shared a photo of the two on Instagram with the caption ""love the way you look at me."" Early November 2014: The Power of \'The Heart Wants What It Wants\' Likely inspired by her relationship with Bieber, Gomez dropped a personal new song along with a music video. Opening ""The Heart Wants What It Wants,"" a emotional voiceover from Gomez said, ""I know him though, and I know that I know his heart, and I know what he wouldn\'t do to hurt me. But I didn\'t realize that I\'m feeling so confident and feeling so great about myself and then it [can] just be completely shattered by one thing. By something so stupid. But then you make me feel crazy, you make me feel like it\'s my fault. I was in pain."" Meanwhile, Bieber posted a quote on Instagram that was interpreted to be his response: ""Sometimes love isn\'t a feeling but a choice."" He added, ""It\'s easy to love when you feel it, but love when it\'s hard to love.""\n\nMid-November 2014: Justin Unfollows Selena on Instagram It was unclear what drama caused him to do this, but fans certainly took notice when Bieber stopped following Gomez on Instagram. Some speculated that he wasn\'t thrilled by the cozy photo she\'d posted with her ""The Heart Wants What It Wants"" music video co-star. ""I think [Justin] was a little jealous of the video guy at first,"" the singer had previously told Ryan Seacrest. June 2015: \'Where Are U Now,\' Selena? In the video for Bieber\'s ""Where Are U Now"" collaboration with Skrillex and Diplo, Selena\'s name clearly makes a cameo. ""Justin wrote this record during a tough time in his life and it comes to us that sometimes, as artists, we are also just objects and we have to take that as much as we have to use that to create,"" Skrillex and Diplo said in a statement.\n\nSeptember 2015: Justin\'s \'What Do You Mean\' Video References Selena Bieber may have been reaching out to Selena in his ""What Do You Mean"" music video. Some super observant fans noticed that her name was spray-painted on a wall of graffiti in the clip for the song, in which he sings lines like ""First you wanna go to the left then you wanna turn right/ Wanna argue all day, make love all night.""\n\nEarly October 2015: Selena Says She\'s Found Closure The singer opened up about her feelings toward her ex-boyfriend while doing press for her new album, Revival. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re on good terms,"" Gomez said in a Billboard cover story, but clarified that she was ready to focus on herself and her career: This is my time. I\xe2\x80\x99ve deserved this. I earned it. This is all me.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cAt this point, there is no anger,"" she said in an interview with Refinery29. ""There\'s closure in a very good, healthy way. We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen each other. I\'m always encouraging and I am proud of his journey. She added: ""I think people are making it out to be something that is more tragic than it really was. We grew up together. We both made mistakes. That\'s it."" Mid-October 2015: A Justin & Selena Duet? One night on OVO Sound Radio, an unreleased song that had the former couple trading vocals came out of nowhere. The track had lyrics about wanting to work things out in a relationship, and Bieber singing the line \xe2\x80\x9cGotta be strong, strong, strong\xe2\x80\x9d in the chorus. It turned out the song was written two years prior and wasn\'t meant to be released, but it sure had fans wondering what was going on at the time. May 2015: A Mini Reunion The two reportedly attended the same church service one weekend, and they were spotted being goofy in a Snapchat video posted by a preacher. August 2015: Selena Throws Some Shade on the \'Jelena\' Obsession The couple\'s relationship -- referred to as ""Jelena"" by many -- may have seen its downfall due to their young age and being overly exposed by the media, according to Gomez. ""It\'s difficult for people to separate us. The internet wants to freeze this moment in time and constantly repeat it,"" she told the U.K.\'s Sunday Times. ""I didn\'t think I was doing anything bad by falling in love,"" the singer said. ""There\'s such an emphasis on people being the perfect thing and then destroying them because it\'s good press. Throw in the fact that you are a teenager -- it makes it more difficult."" September 2015: What Justin Learned While he didn\'t say her name, Bieber described his intense relationship with Gomez in an interview with Complex. ""I moved in with my girlfriend when I was 18,"" he said. ""Started my own life with her. It was a marriage kind of thing. Living with a girl, it was just too much at that age. But we were so in love. Nothing else mattered. We were all about each other. ""But when it\xe2\x80\x99s like that and you get your value from that, people will always disappoint you,"" he went on. ""Your girl or your dude, they\xe2\x80\x99re always going to disappoint you. Your full identity can\xe2\x80\x99t be in that person. My identity was in her. Her identity was in me. When stuff would happen, I would lose my freakin\xe2\x80\x99 mind, and she would lose her mind, and we would fight so hard because we were so invested in each other. Love is a choice. Love is not a feeling. People have made it seem in movies that it\xe2\x80\x99s this fairy tale. That\xe2\x80\x99s not what love is. You\xe2\x80\x99re not gonna want to love your girl sometimes but you\xe2\x80\x99re gonna choose to love her. That\xe2\x80\x99s something in life that I had to figure out."" Early November 2015: \'A Love That Never Really Dies\' In a Billboard cover story, Bieber proclaimed, ""When you love someone that much, even if something comes between you, it\xe2\x80\x99s a love that never really dies."" In an interview with Access Hollywood around the same time period, he admitted that at least three of the tracks on his Purpose album were about Gomez. On an Ellen appearance, he revealed the titles of those songs -- ""Sorry,"" ""What Do You Mean"" and ""Mark My Words"" -- and mused that someday they ""could maybe come together and make an awesome duo"" once again.\n\n""It was really tough. I don\'t know if I\'m over it yet,"" Bieber said of their breakup at the time. ""[She] is someone I love dearly,"" he went on. ""I\'m never going to stop loving her. I\'m never going to stop checking in on her. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think if you end a relationship, you should end that, unless it was super toxic and you guys were hurting each other physically or mentally. We always respected each other and we still respect each other."" ""I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what happens. I don\'t know what is going to happen in the future. I think we both gotta do some soul searching ourselves and figure out ourselves before we can just try to figure out each other,"" he added. Late November 2015: Selena\'s Still His Sunshine on a Cloudy Day Over a year after they were last seen out in public with one another, Bieber made a crystal clear statement when he serenaded his former flame with ""My Girl"" at a hotel bar. The pair reportedly left together, according to footage captured by TMZ.\n\nDecember 2015: Justin Gets Nostalgic on Instagram Bieber advised everyone to ""calm down"" when he posted some cute throwback photos from his dating days with Gomez, including one of the two of them on a red quadbike, and another of the couple holding hands a movie premiere.\n\nJust a throwback calm down A post shared by Justin Bieber (@justinbieber) on Dec 1, 2015 at 7:03pm PST\n\nCrazy throwback A post shared by Justin Bieber (@justinbieber) on Dec 5, 2015 at 11:25pm PST\n\nJanuary 2016: Selena Is So Over Talking About Her Ex The ""Same Old Love"" singer got straight to the point when Rolling Stone asked her about Bieber. ""Honestly, what I would love to be printed is that I am so beyond done with talking about that, and him,"" she responded. \'Nuff said. February 2016: They\'re on Friendly Terms ""We don\'t talk often, but we\'re cordial. If she needs something, I\'m there for her. If I need something, she\'s there for me,"" Bieber said of his ex in an interview with GQ. During the same period, Gomez congratulated him on winning a Grammy for ""Where Are U Now"": \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m very happy for him. Honestly, so cool,"" she said. March 2016: Justin Lets Us in on All the \'Feels\' Throwing it back yet again, Bieber showed everyone he was still thinking about his romance with Gomez by posting an old photo of the former couple locking lips. The intimate picture would go on to become the most-liked picture on Instagram at the time.\n\nFeels A post shared by Justin Bieber (@justinbieber) on Mar 19, 2016 at 4:07pm PDT\n\nJuly 2016: Justin\'s Mom Wishes Selena a Happy Birthday Bieber probably isn\'t singing about Gomez on ""Love Yourself,"" since his mama clearly does like her. On Gomez\'s birthday, Pattie Mallette (Bieber\'s mom) wished the singer a happy birthday, along with a very pleasant message: ""I am blessed to know you @selenagomez & celebrate this precious day you were born!""'"

"b'I.T. Couple\n\nBrin\xe2\x80\x99s and Wojcicki\xe2\x80\x99s orbits collided in 1998, when Brin, a graduate student in Stanford\xe2\x80\x99s computer-science department, moved off campus with classmate Larry Page to set up a search-engine company in Wojcicki\xe2\x80\x99s sister Susan\xe2\x80\x99s garage. Susan, who met Brin when he dated a friend of hers, charged them $1,700 a month rent to offset her mortgage (she is now the most senior female employee at Google, and the new head of YouTube). Brin and Page filled the garage with desks made of old pine doors set on sawhorses, a turquoise shag carpet, and a Ping-Pong table. Their search engine, initially called \xe2\x80\x9cBackRub,\xe2\x80\x9d evaluated the incoming links on a page instead of keywords, as their competitors did, as well as the importance of the entity doing the linking. (In search, as in life, it\xe2\x80\x99s about who you know.)\n\nBrin\xe2\x80\x99s parents, a pair of Russian-Jewish scientists from Moscow, had experienced prejudice in their home country, and migrated when he was six years old with help from the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society (a charity to which Brin gave $1 million in 2009, and where his mother, Eugenia, serves on the board). The scientific community outside of Washington, D.C., embraced his parents, though money was still an issue, instilling a sense of frugality in their son.\n\nThe Wojcickis were similarly tight-knit and academic\xe2\x80\x94and, like the Brins, also thrifty and non-materialistic. Wojcicki\xe2\x80\x99s father was the chairman of Stanford\xe2\x80\x99s physics department, and her mother is a journalism teacher. A lightly tanned brunette who was high-energy, athletic, and popular in school\xe2\x80\x94a sort of Jennifer Aniston in Birkenstocks\xe2\x80\x94Wojcicki figure-skated as a child and played ice hockey at Yale, where she majored in biology. After graduation she worked as a health-care investment analyst on Wall Street for 10 years. Her parents weren\xe2\x80\x99t entirely pleased. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was always embarrassing to come home,\xe2\x80\x9d she has said. \xe2\x80\x9cPeople were like, \xe2\x80\x98Oh, Anne, you Wall Street girl.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d (Neither Brin nor Wojcicki responded to questions from Vanity Fair.)\n\nIn Brin, Wojcicki found another child of baby-boomer academics who could see beyond academia\xe2\x80\x99s cautious, elitist approach to discovering new knowledge, a slow process in which researchers propose a hypothesis, organize an experiment to collect data, submit findings to peer review, and finally, many months later, gain publication in an esoteric journal. Brin and Wojcicki are pioneers of a different model, with enormous potential in both its reach and its speed: they look to advanced, Web-based tools and large data sets as the key to solving problems, from how to target advertising to discovering the drugs to treat cancer. Hypotheses can be limiting and scientists can be led astray; using massive computing power to find patterns is quick, and data sets don\xe2\x80\x99t lie.\n\nAs Wojcicki and Brin started seeing each other, Google had not only weathered the dot-com crash but begun to dominate the search-engine business and was minting money via AdWords, the most effective advertising platform in history. Eventually, Google would employ 55,000 people on its 65-building campus in Mountain View, California, creating the country\xe2\x80\x99s best e-mail platform (Gmail), their own browser (Chrome), a G.P.S. mapping system (Google Maps), a news aggregator (Google News), the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest collection of data-storage servers, and the world\xe2\x80\x99s most popular mobile operating system (Android). Google became a supremely powerful corporation, but in its DNA it remained anti-corporate. While it acted aggressively to innovate, Brin and Page tried as hard as possible to hew to their unofficial motto of \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be evil,\xe2\x80\x9d keeping their search engine pure despite attempts by major advertisers to game results. When Google, in a rare misstep, censored its results in China, Brin, whose parents\xe2\x80\x99 experience attuned him to the abuses of totalitarian regimes, took the leading role in pulling the company out of the country.\n\nThe corporate culture that you\xe2\x80\x99ve likely heard about at Google\xe2\x80\x94the lack of a dress code, the free sushi, the pets at work, the free Pilates sessions\xe2\x80\x94was all part of the founders\xe2\x80\x99 mission to create a benevolent workplace. When investors leaned on Page and Brin to hire an established C.E.O.\xe2\x80\x94what\xe2\x80\x99s called \xe2\x80\x9cadult supervision\xe2\x80\x9d in the Valley\xe2\x80\x94they selected Eric Schmidt, a computer scientist and manager who was known to attend Burning Man, the annual, costumed bacchanal and creativity free-for-all in the Nevada desert that\xe2\x80\x99s a tradition among Google executives. \xe2\x80\x9cLarry and Sergey genuinely care about innovation, and part of that means genuinely caring about employees so they do the best and most creative work they can do,\xe2\x80\x9d says a former Googler.\n\nCreativity meant thinking about things differently from the way other corporations did, and it\xe2\x80\x99s part of how Google stays on top. It also meant that when Brin got married it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be in the traditional way. In 2007 he and Wojcicki invited guests to a secret location in the Bahamas. Wojcicki hadn\xe2\x80\x99t always wanted to get hitched\xe2\x80\x94during her years on the Street she saw bankers cheating on their wives, according to the friend of the couple\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94but Brin was her man. For the wedding, she wore a white bathing suit, and the groom a black one. They swam out to a sandbar to take their vows surrounded by the ocean.\n\n__FAST COMPANY__Wojcicki and Brin at the 2014 Breakthrough Prizes in Fundamental Physics and Life Sciences ceremony, co-hosted by V.F. in Mountain View, California., By Steve Jennings/Getty Images.\n\nA year later, Wojcicki gave birth to their first child just as Google executives started enjoying life as some of the richest people in the world. Schmidt was a pilot, and, according to the friend, he encouraged other Google executives to indulge their desires for yachts and planes. Brin, Page, and Schmidt purchased at least a half-dozen planes, including a 767 and a 757; they basically \xe2\x80\x9cown an airline,\xe2\x80\x9d says the friend. Brin also purchased a home in New York City\xe2\x80\x99s West Village. Schmidt bought Ellen DeGeneres\xe2\x80\x99s $20 million Montecito mansion, a $15 million New York apartment, which made an appearance as Shia LaBeouf\xe2\x80\x99s pad in the film Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps, and, recently, a $22 million home near the Playboy Mansion, in Holmby Hills.\n\nSchmidt\xe2\x80\x99s wife, Wendy, however, retreated to their compound on Nantucket and didn\xe2\x80\x99t often make the Google social scene. Schmidt, now 58, was sometimes accompanied by younger women, one of whom briefly worked at Google.\n\nSeveral former Google employees say that the company is casual in its approach to dating at work. One says that Google is \xe2\x80\x9cintentionally agnostic about dating,\xe2\x80\x9d and that there are hundreds of \xe2\x80\x9cGoogle couples\xe2\x80\x9d among its global offices. In fact, Google\xe2\x80\x99s code of conduct does not ban dating between employees, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cRomantic relationships between co-workers can, depending on the work roles and respective positions of the co-workers involved, create an actual or apparent conflict of interest. If a romantic relationship does create an actual or apparent conflict, it may require changes to work arrangements or even the termination of employment of either or both individuals involved.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nConcerning the culture of office romances at Google, one Atherton socialite with close connections to the company says, \xe2\x80\x9cWhen you have executives dating employees, it\xe2\x80\x99s like a doctor-nurse relationship\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s not illegal, but it seems like it shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be happening. Tech is a man\xe2\x80\x99s world. Most of these guys are married, and then there are these young fresh [female] sharks, and they\xe2\x80\x99re smart too.\xe2\x80\x9d But the men have hundreds of millions of dollars. The socialite trots out an old saw: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s almost like you get a Stanford degree so you can work at Google, so you can find a husband.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nOver the years, there have been several notable workplace romances at the top levels of Google, including one between Page and Marissa Mayer, now the C.E.O. of Yahoo. There were hallway discussions about the two of them dating, and some believed being close to Mayer was helpful when trying to quickly secure Page\xe2\x80\x99s approval for a project.\n\nWojcicki, unlike many wives of rich men, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t enthusiastic about collecting art or jewelry, and she argued against buying planes and boats, says the friend of the couple\xe2\x80\x99s. Some say she can be headstrong and withholding of praise, hot to her own ideas and dismissive of others\xe2\x80\x99. Wojcicki is adamant about wanting a \xe2\x80\x9cnormalized\xe2\x80\x9d life, says a source close to her, using the Silicon Valley billionaires\xe2\x80\x99 phrase for \xe2\x80\x9cnormal.\xe2\x80\x9d But there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing normal about the astronomical wealth, or the power that comes from being the ones changing the world.\n\nIn 2006, Wojcicki co-founded 23andMe and soon raised several rounds of financing, including $6.5 million from Google. She hoped to attract over a million customers to her company, coaxing them to spit into a tube and send the saliva to her DNA-genotyping lab for today\xe2\x80\x99s low price of $99. Her mission was to pass along as much information as possible about each person\xe2\x80\x99s health and ancestry, on the principle that this knowledge, by rights, is ours. But not everyone receives good news; many have learned about elevated levels of risk for breast cancer, Alzheimer\xe2\x80\x99s, or Parkinson\xe2\x80\x99s. Some health-care professionals believe it is unwise to give individuals such daunting news without the support of personal counseling.\n\nWojcicki, it turns out, had a more personal stake in her business than one might imagine. Brin\xe2\x80\x99s great-aunt suffered from Parkinson\xe2\x80\x99s, the neuro-degenerative disorder, and his mother was diagnosed with it in 1999. It was long thought that Parkinson\xe2\x80\x99s was not hereditary. But beginning in 2004, researchers suggested that people with a certain gene mutation (more common among Ashkenazi Jews) have a risk of between 30 and 75 percent of succumbing to the disease. (The general population\xe2\x80\x99s risk is about 1 percent.) When Wojcicki tested Brin, his results were positive for the mutation. Brin read the risk as possibly having only about 10 good years left, says the friend of the couple\xe2\x80\x99s.\n\nAfter getting such news, some of us would curl up into a ball, but Brin didn\xe2\x80\x99t. Unlike Steve Jobs, who fiercely guarded news about his health, Brin started a blog and announced his results publicly, at Google\xe2\x80\x99s Zeitgeist conference in 2008 in Mountain View. Brin began exercising even more relentlessly than usual, and drinking coffee, which some doctors recommend for those at risk for the disease, even though he abhorred the taste. (He eventually switched to green tea.) He told Wired magazine that he hoped those steps might reduce his risk by half, and if research on the brain progresses, as he believes it will, his risk could be cut in half again.\n\nIn addition, Wojcicki and Brin have the means to aid such research, and they have given more than $150 million to the Michael J. Fox Foundation and $7 million to the Parkinson\xe2\x80\x99s Institute. They have also donated to the Breakthrough Prizes, one of which was awarded to a Parkinson\xe2\x80\x99s researcher at a ceremony at the NASA Ames Research Center, in Mountain View, last fall co-hosted by Vanity Fair. Research on the 10,000 Parkinson\xe2\x80\x99s sufferers that Wojcicki has recruited at 23andMe, the largest cohort of these genotypes in the world, might cut Brin\xe2\x80\x99s risk even more. \xe2\x80\x9cSomewhere under 10 percent\xe2\x80\x9d is his own assessment.\n\nA New Life\n\nIn the years following his genetic test, Brin shifted his focus at Google. Like many leaders in Silicon Valley, he had grown bored with quotidian problems and started to dream more about things that were literally out of this world, like space travel and robots who will become our friends. As Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen invested $200 million on a superplane that can launch a rocket, and Tesla\xe2\x80\x99s Elon Musk talked about the Hyperloop, Brin, working at a company with the country\xe2\x80\x99s top engineers, threw his energy into Google X, the company\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9csecret lab,\xe2\x80\x9d in two nondescript buildings near the Mountain View campus.\n\nIn 2012, to debut Google Glass, Brin coordinated a skydiving stunt, with a team of jumpers leaping out of a zeppelin over downtown San Francisco. The media was enthralled: Brin, they said, was the real-life Tony Stark, the comic-book genius innovator played by Robert Downey Jr. in the Iron Man films. (Actually, director Jon Favreau says Musk was his inspiration.) Glass was Brin\xe2\x80\x99s first big project at X; now he\xe2\x80\x99s ready to turn his attention to driverless cars, beta versions of which are crisscrossing San Francisco today, like so many ghosts.\n\nThe first incarnation of Glass, a 10-pound, head-mounted display attached to cables that looped to a box on the user\xe2\x80\x99s belt, was not sexy, but Brin had it redesigned as sleek, lensless frames in shades of \xe2\x80\x9ccotton,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9ctangerine,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9csky.\xe2\x80\x9d Still, they screamed \xe2\x80\x9cnerd.\xe2\x80\x9d At an Allen & Co. conference in Sun Valley, Idaho, Brin and Wojcicki approached designer Diane von Furstenberg with an idea: perhaps she would like to collaborate. The designer was tickled by the notion of her models wearing Glass at a fashion show. It would lend a bit of tech gloss to her company, and fashion glamour for Glass.\n\nFor the event the Glass team, including Amanda Rosenberg, descended on New York to collaborate with von Furstenberg\xe2\x80\x99s studio. Brin and Wojcicki threw a party at their home in the West Village and Glass\xe2\x80\x99s palette was matched to von Furstenberg\xe2\x80\x99s clothes. On the day of the show, during New York\xe2\x80\x99s Fashion Week, Rosenberg posed with von Furstenberg and Brin for celebratory photos. She posted a picture of herself sitting in the front row, using Glass to record the show. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can see that everyone looks pretty cool, whereas I can barely contain my excitement,\xe2\x80\x9d Rosenberg wrote, with her usual sense of self-deprecating humor.\n\nWhile Glass was blowing up in the press, a friend admits, Wojcicki may have been a bit hard on Brin. \xe2\x80\x9cAnne is great, but she can be difficult,\xe2\x80\x9d says the friend. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s hard on Sergey, and she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t let him get away with things.\xe2\x80\x9d She was focused on saving him: when research discovered that a gene variant might protect those with Brin\xe2\x80\x99s rare Parkinson\xe2\x80\x99s-related mutation, Wojcicki patented it. (Like many of her business decisions, patenting genes\xe2\x80\x94a move often seen as an attempt to corner a drug market\xe2\x80\x94is controversial in the medical establishment.)\n\nWojcicki still wanted a normal life, or as normal as she could have: to be a dedicated mom and for the family to have dinner together. But \xe2\x80\x9cinstead of just being a Google founder, Sergey was suddenly awesome, a cool person, a performer\xe2\x80\x94a celebrity!\xe2\x80\x9d says the friend of the couple\xe2\x80\x99s. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd he was like, \xe2\x80\x98Wait a second\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m doing all this cool stuff, and then I have to come home and change diapers?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWojcicki began to help Brin informally on Google Glass, says the friend. Rosenberg wanted to get the product into the hands of moms, so she came over to Wojcicki\xe2\x80\x99s home to discuss reaching out to the many kid-oriented services in Los Altos. At the time, Rosenberg\xe2\x80\x99s boyfriend was Hugo Barra, a high-ranking executive on Google\xe2\x80\x99s Android team. A Brazilian educated at M.I.T., he was essentially the face of their new mini-tablet, the Nexus 7, and a well-regarded, creative product manager. Rosenberg posted internal videos of the two of them together and was \xe2\x80\x9cso proud when she started dating him,\xe2\x80\x9d says a co-worker. Over the holiday season in 2012\xe2\x80\x9313, says the couple\xe2\x80\x99s friend, Wojcicki and Rosenberg became close enough that Wojcicki bought Rosenberg a Christmas present. The two of them went to a birthday dinner for Russian investor Yuri Milner, with Barra, Brin, and both Wojcicki\xe2\x80\x99s and Brin\xe2\x80\x99s parents. Rosenberg was smoking cigarettes, and Barra wanted her to stop. Wojcicki lectured her about the health risks.\n\nAround that time, according to the friend, Wojcicki came across messages between Rosenberg and Brin that caused her to feel alarm, and she mentioned her concern to Rosenberg. (Rosenberg declined to comment for this article.) A few months later, in April, Brin moved out of their estate in Los Altos and into another home that they own nearby. He and Wojcicki maintained a cordial relationship.'"

Why would anyone want her to get back together with him? \xe2\x80\x94 Alina (@__LinaGarcia) February 16, 2018\n\nNot many believed them, but the pair always insisted they waited to get romantic, with Jolie telling the fashion magazine they were merely \xe2\x80\x98very, very good friends\xe2\x80\x99 until after Pitt and Aniston ended their marriage.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98It took until, really, the end of the shoot for us, I think to realize that it might mean something more than we\xe2\x80\x99d earlier allowed ourselves to believe. And both knowing that the reality of that was a big thing, something that was going to take a lot of serious consideration,\xe2\x80\x99 she said.\n\nIn 2005, Pitt joined Jolie on a trip to Ethiopia to adopt her second child. He formally adopted the little girl, Zahara, and her older brother Maddox, in 2006. That same year he and Jolie welcomed their first biological child together, a daughter named Shiloh.\n\nJolie adopted son Pax in 2007, with Pitt adopting the child as his own in 2008. That year the couple welcomed two more biological children, twins Knox and Vivienne. They married at the urging of their children in 2014.\n\nPlot twist: she gets back with Brad Pitt and is step mom to Angelina\xe2\x80\x99s kids #JenniferAniston pic.twitter.com/z60mXi2Jb0 \xe2\x80\x94 Jerry Don (@JerryDonut1) February 16, 2018\n\nThe ceremony took place in their French chateau. At the time, Jolie and Pitt had been engaged for close to two years.\n\nThe pair previously said that they would not marry until it was legal for all people to be married.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98We both have been married before, so it\xe2\x80\x99s not marriage that\xe2\x80\x99s necessarily kept some people together,\xe2\x80\x99 Jolie told Vogue. \xe2\x80\x98We are legally bound to our children, not to each other, and I think that\xe2\x80\x99s the most important thing.\xe2\x80\x99\n\nAfter 11 years together, Jolie and Pitt shocked fans by announcing their divorce. Jolie\xe2\x80\x99s attorney, Robert Offer, told AP that her decision to end the marriage was \xe2\x80\x98for the health of the family\xe2\x80\x99.\n\nPitt fired back in a statement of his own, which he released to People magazine, in which he claimed he was \xe2\x80\x98saddened\xe2\x80\x99 by the whole ordeal. He went on to say that his focus, at the time, was on his children.\n\nNot long after they went public about their divorce, reports surfaced suggesting that Pitt was being investigated for child abuse linked to an incident on a private plane. People reported that the Los Angeles Police Department and the L.A. County Department of Children and Family Services was looking into an anonymous report that Pitt had been \xe2\x80\x98verbally abusive\xe2\x80\x99 and gotten \xe2\x80\x98physical\xe2\x80\x99 with one of his children, which later was revealed to be Maddox.\n\nThe incident in question reportedly occurred on September 14. Pitt is said to have been drinking at the time. His entire family was present during the alleged altercation.\n\nTo the people feeling sorry 4 #JenniferAniston\n\nShe is successful,clever,beautiful & seems like she would be a blast. She has dated a string of hotties including, #BradPitt #JustinTheroux etc & has probably done all this without having to change a dirty diaper... #IWantToBeHer pic.twitter.com/BxK6fTnN7N \xe2\x80\x94 Nolene Dougan (@NoleneDougan) February 16, 2018\n\nLAPD later denied the report, stating that they had \xe2\x80\x98no criminal investigation\xe2\x80\x99 open on the actor at the time. People later amended their report to say that DCFS was the only agency investigating Pitt. TMZ later released an article stating that the FBI was also investigating the incident.\n\nThe FBI responded to a request for comment from Us Weekly, stating that they were still determining what action, if any, should be taken.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98In response to your inquiry regarding allegations within the special aircraft jurisdiction of the United States; specifically, an aircraft carrying Mr Brad Pitt and his children, the FBI is continuing to gather facts and will evaluate whether an investigation at the federal level will be pursued,\xe2\x80\x99 the statement read.\n\nIn the end, Pitt was not prosecuted in the incident. He and Jolie reached a custody agreement, and he was eventually able to have his first visit with his children.\n\nNo word from Pitt nor Aniston about whether reconciliation is on the horizon, though it has not stopped rampant speculation, with one report even saying they were planning on making their debut as a couple at this year's Oscars."""

"b'Those impatient with high-end Britfilm period product might worry that this movie takes a rather picturesque view of disability issues, and for the first 20 minutes I came pretty close to this standpoint myself. But you have to give Breathe time to let its charm and its heartfelt decency grow on you. The film is about an important figure in the history of how we think about and respect disabled people \xe2\x80\x93 the wheelchair-use pioneer and polio survivor Robin Cavendish (whose son Jonathan is the movie\xe2\x80\x99s producer).\n\nAndy Serkis makes his debut as director, working from a robust screenplay by William Nicholson. Andrew Garfield plays Cavendish, a rather dashing fellow in the 1950s who zooms around the place in his sports car and plays a splendid game of cricket, hitting a six that breaks the teacups set out by the clubhouse and roguishly calling out: \xe2\x80\x9cSorry!\xe2\x80\x9d He spots a beautiful young woman among the spectators: Diana Blacker, played by Claire Foy. It\xe2\x80\x99s love at first sight, and marriage soon afterwards, and then a rather memsahib-like existence for her in Kenya (pronounced Keen-ya) because Cavendish is a \xe2\x80\x9ctea broker\xe2\x80\x9d there.\n\nBut then one day Cavendish feels faint and collapses: he has polio, is paralysed from the neck down, and after he is brought back to England, the medical establishment curtly tells Diana not to expect her husband to live any more than a few months, and only as a prostrate patient who must be passive and obedient. But armed with love and courage, the Cavendishes demand more of existence than this, and Robin defies the grumpy doctors by using a new respirator-wheelchair invented especially for him. It is possible that for this role, Garfield studied Kenneth More playing the disabled Air Force pilot Douglas Bader in the biopic Reach for the Sky.\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s a valuable and touching story, and it is extraordinary to think that so recently, disabled people in this position were treated like living corpses, there to be clinically warehoused and studied, and told to be grateful and mute. There is a chilling scene in which Cavendish and his friends are taken to see a facility in Germany that turns out to be some Kubrickian living morgue: white, brightly lit, with patients entombed in state-of-the-art medical sarcophagi.\n\nAs for the central relationship, it is a matter of getting on with it, keeping love alive in the little things and staying cheerful in a very British way \xe2\x80\x93 which I\xe2\x80\x99m sure is a fair depiction of exactly how the Cavendishes coped. There is a delicate allusion to what might be called their conjugal intimacy \xe2\x80\x93 Robin says it is a matter of Diana \xe2\x80\x9cdoing all the work\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 although the business of other bodily functions is not shown. The lump-in-the-throat seriousness is offset with fun small roles, principally for Tom Hollander, who plays both Diana\xe2\x80\x99s twin brothers and provides some much-needed irony and cynicism. Hugh Bonneville has some fun with the role of scientist Teddy Hall, who invents Robin\xe2\x80\x99s wheelchair.\n\nThe problem is that there is not much light and shade in the Cavendishes themselves \xe2\x80\x93 and certainly not with Diana, at times a rather thankless role for Foy (given far less to chew on here than as the Queen in the Netflix series The Crown). She is loyal, loving, often exasperated and sometimes angry \xe2\x80\x93 but it is still a pretty narrow emotional bandwidth. Robin has his own dark night of the soul, just after he is told that he will not walk again, but it is always clear that this bitterness is only temporary.\n\nAnd those who wonder if the British film industry will tackle the issue of Kenya and the Mau Mau uprising may not be entirely happy with the way that is invoked: a rather saucer-eyed anecdote around the Kenyan camp-fire about Mau Mau prisoners choosing a Zen-willed suicide for themselves in detention camps. Most accounts suggest Mau Mau prisoners died rather more brutally than that, yet this quaint image is later revived to evoke Robin\xe2\x80\x99s own stoicism when his own condition becomes too much to bear.\n\nAt all events, Breathe is an affecting account of the quiet courage needed to battle the deadly spores of discrimination and condescension that came with polio.'"

"b'Rumors suggesting that Gwen Stefani is pregnant do not bother Blake Shelton anymore, a source close to him told Gossip Cop.\n\nShelton has often found himself confronting untrue reports about his relationship with Gwen Stefani ever since the two got together a few years ago. Almost on a constant basis, one can find false reports claiming that Blake and Gwen are getting married, or that they have already split up. Initially, Shelton found these reports so infuriating that they would get \xe2\x80\x9cunder his skin,\xe2\x80\x9d making him feel angry about how the media was exploiting their relationship for their interests.\n\nBut it appears Shelton cannot be bothered anymore. The source close to him said that one day he \xe2\x80\x9cjust decided he can\xe2\x80\x99t be bothered,\xe2\x80\x9d and that he has become \xe2\x80\x9cimmune\xe2\x80\x9d to Gwen Stefani pregnancy rumors.

While there usually wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be any questions about the subject considering the Boston-bred stars\xe2\x80\x99 long-standing friendship, Damon has been spending a lot of time with Hemsworth in recent months, especially since \xe2\x80\x9cThe Martian\xe2\x80\x9d star made a cameo in last year\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cThor: Ragnarok.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nOf course, gossip publications have noticed the budding new friendship as well, taking things a bit further by insinuating that Hemsworth is replacing Affleck as Damon\xe2\x80\x99s BFF.

"b'American actress\n\nJennifer Joanna Aniston (born February 11, 1969) is an American actress, producer, and businesswoman. The daughter of actors John Aniston and Nancy Dow, she began working as an actress at an early age with an uncredited role in the 1987 film Mac and Me. Her first major film role came in the 1993 horror comedy Leprechaun. Since her career grew in the early 1990s, Aniston has been one of Hollywood\'s highest-paid actresses.\n\nAniston rose to international fame for her role as Rachel Green on the television sitcom Friends (1994\xe2\x80\x932004), for which she earned Primetime Emmy, Golden Globe, and Screen Actors Guild awards. Her character became widely popular and was described as one of the greatest female characters in American television history. Aniston has since played starring roles in numerous dramas, comedies and romantic comedies. Her biggest box office successes include the films Bruce Almighty (2003), The Break-Up (2006), Marley & Me (2008), Just Go with It (2011), Horrible Bosses (2011), and We\'re the Millers (2013), each of which grossed over $200 million in worldwide box office receipts. Some of her most critically acclaimed film roles include Office Space (1999), The Good Girl (2002), Friends with Money (2006), Cake (2014), and Dumplin\' (2018). She returned to television in 2019, producing and starring in the Apple TV+ drama series The Morning Show, for which she won another Screen Actors Guild Award.\n\nAniston has been included in numerous magazines\' lists of the world\'s most beautiful women. Her net worth is estimated to be US$200 million. She is the recipient of a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Aniston is also the co-founder of the production company Echo Films, established in 2008. Aniston is divorced from actor Brad Pitt, to whom she was married for five years. She is also separated from actor Justin Theroux, whom she married in 2015.\n\nEarly life\n\nAniston was born on February 11, 1969, in the Los Angeles neighborhood of Sherman Oaks,[1][2] the daughter of Greek-born actor John Aniston and actress Nancy Dow.[1] One of her maternal great-grandfathers, Louis Grieco, was from Italy.[3] Her mother\'s other ancestry includes English, Irish, Scottish, and a small amount of Greek.[4] Aniston has two half-brothers: John Melick, her older maternal half-brother, and Alex Aniston, her younger paternal half-brother.[1] Aniston\'s godfather was actor Telly Savalas, one of her father\'s best friends.[1][5]\n\nAs a child she moved to New York City.[1] Despite her father\'s television career she was discouraged from watching television, though she found ways around the prohibition. When she was six, she began attending a Waldorf school.[6] Her parents split up when she was nine years old.[7]\n\nHaving discovered acting at age 11 at the Waldorf school,[7] Aniston enrolled in Manhattan\'s Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts, where she joined the school\'s drama society;[8] Anthony Abeson was her drama teacher.[9] She performed in The Sign in Sidney Brustein\'s Window by Lorraine Hansberry and Three Sisters by Anton Chekhov.[10]\n\nCareer\n\nBeginnings (1988\xe2\x80\x931993)\n\nAniston first worked in Off-Broadway productions such as For Dear Life and Dancing on Checker\'s Grave,[1] and supported herself with part-time jobs which included working as a telemarketer, waitress, and bike messenger.[1] In 1988, she had an uncredited minor role in the critically panned sci-fi adventure film Mac and Me. The next year she appeared on The Howard Stern Show as a spokesmodel for Nutrisystem,[11] and moved back to Los Angeles.[12]\n\nShe obtained her first regular television role on Molloy in 1990, and appeared in Ferris Bueller, a television adaptation of the 1986 film Ferris Bueller\'s Day Off; both series were quickly canceled. She starred as a teenager going to summer camp in the made-for-television film Camp Cucamonga (1990), and as a spoiled daughter followed by a vengeful leprechaun in the horror film Leprechaun (1993).[13] A 2014 retrospective from Entertainment Weekly identified Leprechaun as her worst role,[14] and Aniston herself has expressed embarrassment over it.[15]\n\nAniston also appeared in two more failed television comedy series, The Edge and Muddling Through,[16] and guest-starred in Quantum Leap, Herman\'s Head, and Burke\'s Law.[17][18]\n\nFriends and breakout (1994\xe2\x80\x932004)\n\nDepressed over her four unsuccessful television shows, Aniston approached Warren Littlefield at a Los Angeles gas station asking for reassurance. The head of NBC entertainment encouraged her to continue acting, and a few months later helped cast her for Friends,[19][16] a sitcom that was set to debut on NBC\'s 1994\xe2\x80\x931995 fall lineup. The producer originally wanted Aniston to audition for the role of Monica Geller,[20] but Courteney Cox was considered more suitable. Thus, Aniston was cast as Rachel Green. She was also offered a spot as a featured player on Saturday Night Live, but turned it down to do Friends.[21] She played Rachel until the show ended in 2004.\n\nThe program was successful and Aniston, along with her co-stars, gained worldwide recognition among television viewers. Her character was widely popular and was later recognized as one of the greatest female characters in American television.[22][23] The actress received five Primetime Emmy Award nominations (two for Supporting Actress, three for Lead Actress), including a win for Lead Actress.[24] She was also nominated for two Golden Globe Awards and won in 2003 as Best Actress \xe2\x80\x93 Television Series Musical or Comedy. According to the Guinness Book of World Records, Aniston (along with her female co-stars) became the highest-paid television actress of all time with her $1 million-per-episode paycheck for the final season of Friends.[25] Her character\'s relationship with Ross Geller, portrayed by David Schwimmer in the show, was widely popular among audiences, and the couple was frequently voted as television\'s favorite couple in polls and magazines.[26]\n\nFollowing a four-year hiatus, Aniston returned to film work in 1996, when she performed in the ensemble cast of romantic comedy She\'s the One.[27] Aniston\'s first starring vehicle was Picture Perfect (1997), in which she played a struggling young advertising executive opposite Kevin Bacon and Jay Mohr. While the film received mixed reviews, it was a moderate commercial success,[28] and Aniston\'s performance was more warmly received, with many critics suggesting that she had screen presence.[29] In 1998, she appeared as a woman who falls for a gay man (played by Paul Rudd) in the romantic comedy The Object of My Affection,[30] and the next year she starred as a restaurant waitress in the cult film Office Space.[31]\n\nShe starred in the independent dramedy The Good Girl (2002) as an unglamorous cashier who cheats on her husband. The film was a commercial success in limited release, taking in over $14 million in North America.[32] Film critic Roger Ebert declared it her breakthrough:\n\nAfter languishing in a series of overlooked movies that ranged from the entertaining Office Space to the disposable Picture Perfect, Jennifer Aniston has at last decisively broken with her Friends image in an independent film of satiric fire and emotional turmoil. It will no longer be possible to consider her in the same way.[33]\n\nAniston\'s biggest commercial success in film has been the comedy Bruce Almighty (2003), in which she played the girlfriend of a television field reporter (Jim Carrey) offered the chance to be God for one week.[34] With a worldwide box office gross of $484 million,[35][36] the film was the fifth-highest-grossing big screen production of the year.[37] Aniston next starred as the old classmate of a tightly wound newly-wed in the romantic comedy Along Came Polly (2004), opposite Ben Stiller,[38] which placed number one at the North American box office, earning $27.7 million in its opening weekend;[39] it eventually made $172 million globally.[40]\n\nContinued film success (2005\xe2\x80\x932013)\n\nIn 2005, Aniston appeared as an alluring woman having an affair with an advertising executive in the thriller Derailed, and as an obituary and wedding announcement writer in the romantic comedy Rumor Has It.[41][42] Both films were moderate box office hits.[43][44] Aniston took on the role of a single, cash-strapped woman working as a maid in the independent drama Friends with Money (2006), which received a limited release.[45]\n\nHer next film was the romantic comedy The Break-Up (2006), alongside Vince Vaughn, in which she starred as one half of a couple having a complicated split when both refuse to move out of the pair\'s recently purchased home. It received mixed reviews but grossed approximately $39.17 million during its opening weekend and $204 million worldwide.[46] The A.V. Club\'s Keith Phipps gave the film a negative review, stating, ""It\'s like watching the \'we were on a break\' episode of Friends stretched to feature length, and without the blessed relief of commercial breaks or the promise of Seinfeld around the corner.""[47] CinemaBlend gave the film a positive review stating, ""In an era of formulaic romantic movies that bear no resemblance to reality, The Break-Up offers a refreshing flipside.""[48]\n\nIn 2006, Aniston directed the short film Room 10, set in a hospital emergency room and starring Robin Wright and Kris Kristofferson, as part of Glamour\'s Reel Moments film series.[49] She noted that she was inspired to direct by actress Gwyneth Paltrow, who also directed a short film that year.[50] In 2007, Aniston guest-starred in an episode of Dirt\xe2\x80\x94playing the rival of Courteney Cox\'s character[51]\xe2\x80\x94and in an episode of 30 Rock, playing a woman who stalks Jack Donaghy.[52] For the latter she received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination as Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series.[53]\n\nThe 2008 comedy drama Marley & Me, starring Aniston and Owen Wilson as the owners of the titular dog, set a record for the largest Christmas Day box office sales ever with $14.75 million. It earned a total of $51.7 million over the four-day weekend and placed number one at the box office, a position it maintained for two weeks.[54] The total worldwide gross was $242.7 million.[55] Her next film in wide release, the romantic comedy He\'s Just Not That into You (2009), in which she starred opposite Ben Affleck, grossed $178.8 million globally[56] and ranked number one at the United States box office for its opening weekend.[57] While it received mixed reviews, Aniston, along with Affleck, Ginnifer Goodwin, and Jennifer Connelly, were praised by critics as stand-outs in the film.[58][59]\n\nAniston appeared as the former wife of a bounty hunter (Gerard Butler) in the romantic comedy action film The Bounty Hunter (2010). The film was panned by critics, with The Hollywood Reporter writing that ""the mishmash ends up as a thoroughly unfunny adult cartoon.""[60] Nevertheless, it was a box office success, garnering over $130 million worldwide.[61] A lukewarm box office reception greeted her next film, the romantic comedy The Switch (2010), in which she starred with Jason Bateman as a 30-something single woman who decides to have a child using a sperm bank. The film\'s opening weekend drew what The Hollywood Reporter dubbed ""a dispiriting $8.4 million.""[62] The film received generally mixed reviews, with review site Metacritic showing 13 out of 30 critics delivering a positive verdict.[63]\n\nIn 2010, Aniston was also a guest star on the season two premiere of ABC\'s sitcom Cougar Town, playing a psychiatrist.[64] Her announcement that she would appear on Cougar Town garnered excitement and was dubbed her return to television. The A.V. Club wrote, ""[her role is] is a funny bit, and it highlights just how much Jennifer Aniston is built to be a TV star.""[65][66][67] In 2011, she starred opposite Adam Sandler as an office manager posing as the wife of a plastic surgeon in the romantic comedy Just Go with It,[68][69][70] and played a sexually aggressive dentist in Horrible Bosses.[71] Just Go with It and Horrible Bosses both made over $100 million in North America and $200 million worldwide.[72][73]\n\nAniston appeared in the comedy Wanderlust (2012) with Paul Rudd,[74] with whom she acted in The Object of My Affection and also Friends, as a married couple who join a commune after losing their money and deciding modern life is not for them.[75] The script for Wanderlust, bought by Universal Pictures,[76] was produced by Judd Apatow.[77][78] Wanderlust received positive reviews but was a box office failure, grossing only $21 million worldwide, against a production budget of $35 million.[79] Aniston starred as a struggling stripper who agrees to pose as a wife for a drug deal, with Jason Sudeikis, in We\'re the Millers (2013). The film received mixed reviews from critics,[80] but was a financial success, grossing $269 million against a budget of $37 million.[81]\n\nRecent roles and return to television (2014\xe2\x80\x93present)\n\nAniston played the role of a stoic socialite who becomes the target of an ill-planned kidnapping plot in Life of Crime (2014), a film adaptation of Elmore Leonard\'s 1978 novel The Switch.[82] The film was released in limited theaters, to positive reviews.[83] Catherine Shoard of The Guardian described her performance as ""endearingly comic""[84] and Eric Kohn of Indie Wire wrote that ""Aniston tops any of her recent performances with a spirited turn that harkens back to her neurotic days on Friends.""[85] She also reprised her role for Horrible Bosses 2 (2014).[86]\n\nIn Cake (2014), Aniston starred as an astringent woman named Claire Simmons who struggles with chronic pain.[87] The film received mixed reviews; however, Aniston\'s performance was highly praised, dubbed by some critics as ""Oscar-worthy.""[88][89][90][91] The Toronto International Film Festival called her performance ""heartbreakingly good"",[92] Gregory Ellwood of HitFix stated, ""It\'s really on most people\'s radar for being a rare dramatic turn for Jennifer Aniston, and she doesn\'t disappoint."" He further stated, ""Aniston makes you believe in Claire\'s pain. She makes you believe this character is at her lowest point and only she can pull herself out of it. ... It\'s a complete performance from beginning to end and she deserves the appropriate accolades for it.""[93] For her portrayal, Aniston was nominated for the Critics\' Choice Movie Award for Best Actress, Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture \xe2\x80\x93 Drama, and SAG Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role.[94][95]\n\nHorrible Bosses in 2011 Aniston at the London premiere ofin 2011\n\nIn 2015, Aniston starred as a reluctant therapist in the screwball comedy She\'s Funny That Way,[96] which received mixed reviews and found a limited release in theaters, but her performance was once again noticed. Wesley Morris of Grantland called her ""one of the great screen comedians. ... Most of her scenes here are extraneous, but her vulgarity and tartness are so sharp that the movie needs them. ... This isn\'t just Aniston having the best stuff. It\'s her having the most fun with her talent. She\'s funny in every way.""[97] She was ""one of the film\'s few bright spots"" for Lou Lumenick from The New York Post.[98]\n\nAniston starred as the recently divorced mother of two children in the romantic comedy Mother\'s Day (2016), directed by Garry Marshall, and opposite Julia Roberts and Kate Hudson.[99] The film was panned by critics and a moderate commercial success.[100] In 2016, she voiced a workaholic and overprotective mother in the animated film Storks, alongside Andy Samberg and Kelsey Grammer,[101] which was released to mostly positive reviews; it grossed over $183.4 million with a $70 million budget.[102][103] Her last 2016 film role was that of a frigidly cold head honcho of a company in the comedy Office Christmas Party, directed by Josh Gordon and Will Speck and opposite Jason Bateman and Kate McKinnon.[104] It made $114.5 million globally.[105]\n\nIn The Yellow Birds, a war drama directed by Alexandre Moors, Aniston portrays the mother of a deceased soldier, alongside Alden Ehrenreich, Tye Sheridan, Jack Huston, and Toni Collette.[106] While she said she does not ""normally gravitate toward being in war films"", she made an exception because the film was ""written so beautifully and in such a way [she] had never experienced"".[107] The film, first presented during the 2017 Sundance Film Festival, received a VOD release in June 2018.[108] The Los Angeles Times wrote in its review: ""Toni Collette and Jennifer Aniston as the soldiers\' quite different but equally concerned mothers, deliver uniformly naturalistic performances"".[109]\n\nIn December 2018, Netflix released the musical comedy Dumplin\', with Aniston as executive producer and star\xe2\x80\x94marking her first project for a streaming service.[110] That year, she began work on two more Netflix projects: Murder Mystery, a comedy that reunites her with Adam Sandler, which premiered on June 14, 2019;[111] and First Ladies, a film about the first lesbian President of the United States, with Tig Notaro as her wife.[112]\n\nAniston made her return to television on November 1, 2019, producing and starring alongside Reese Witherspoon in the Apple TV+ drama The Morning Show. It is her first main television role since the conclusion of Friends in 2004.[113] Aniston won the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Drama Series, and was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series and two Golden Globe Awards for Best Actress \xe2\x80\x93 Television Series Drama and Best Television Series \xe2\x80\x93 Drama as the series\' producer.[114][115][116]\n\nOther ventures\n\nAniston has appeared in commercials and music videos throughout her career.

For a few years, their marriage was considered the rare Hollywood success.[1] On January 7, 2005, they announced their separation,[175] and finalized their divorce on October 2.[176] During their divorce proceedings, there was intense speculation in the media that Pitt had been unfaithful to Aniston with his Mr. & Mrs. Smith co-star Angelina Jolie, whom he started dating soon after the split.[177] In the following months, the public\'s reaction toward the divorce was reported in the press, and ""Team Aniston"" and ""Team Jolie"" t-shirts appeared throughout the country.[177] Aniston commented on the divorce in a January 2015 interview with The Hollywood Reporter, stating that: ""Nobody did anything wrong... It was just like, sometimes things [happen].""[167]\n\nIn 2005, amid reports that their divorce was due to Aniston\'s refusal to have children with Pitt, Aniston stated to Vanity Fair, ""I\'ve never in my life said I didn\'t want to have children. I did and I do and I will! ... I would never give up that experience for a career."" Aniston also revealed that the divorce prompted her to reach out to her mother, from whom she was estranged for nearly a decade. They initially became estranged when Nancy talked about her daughter on a television show and wrote From Mother and Daughter to Friends: A Memoir (1999).[178][179] Aniston has also stated she was devastated by the death of her longtime therapist, whose work helped make her separation from Pitt easier.[50] She said her relationship with Pitt, which she does not regret, was ""seven very intense years together"" and that ""it was a beautiful, complicated relationship"".[180]\n\nFrom 2008\xe2\x80\x9309, she briefly dated singer and musician John Mayer, making a notable public appearance at the 81st Academy Awards.[181]\n\nAniston started a relationship with actor, director, and screenwriter Justin Theroux in May 2011.

She has been a regular on FHM\'s 100 Sexiest Women list since 1996, most recently ranking at number 79 in 2012.[198] In 2011, The Daily Telegraph reported the most sought-after body parts of the rich and famous revealed by two Hollywood plastic surgeons who carried out a survey among their patients to build up the picture of what the perfect woman would look like. Under the category of the most sought-after body shape, Aniston was voted in the top three, alongside Gisele B\xc3\xbcndchen and Pen\xc3\xa9lope Cruz.[199] In the same year, readers of Men\'s Health magazine voted Aniston the Sexiest Woman of All Time.[200] Men\'s Health also included her on its 100 Hottest Sex Symbols of All Time list, explaining that ""Her down-to-earth persona makes her seem attainable, and anyone who\'s seen her in Office Space has to admit she makes even pieces of flair look good. She rarely plays the airhead, and she seldom overplays a role: she\'s funny in a quiet, refreshingly human way. And her all-too-human love life off screen inspires sympathy that not even a string of bland romantic comedies can diminish. Other sex symbols drift toward one-dimensionality, becoming flat icons in the process, but throughout her career Aniston has remained sexy, funny, and unmistakably real.""[201] Although Aniston disliked the hairstyle she wore during her first two years on Friends, ""The Rachel"" became very popular.[202][203]\n\nShe received a motion picture star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on February 22, 2012,[204] located at 6270 Hollywood Boulevard.[205] On Forbes\' list of the 100 Most Powerful Actresses in Hollywood, she was ranked third in 2013.[206]\n\nIn July 2016, she wrote an essay for The Huffington Post in reply to rumors about her, where she criticized ""The objectification and scrutiny we put women through"" and stated that: ""We are complete with or without a mate, with or without a child. We get to decide for ourselves what is beautiful when it comes to our bodies. ... We don\'t need to be married or mothers to be complete. We get to determine our own \'happily ever after\' for ourselves.""[207] The essay was supported by many celebrities and covered widely in the media.[208]\n\nAfter years of aversion to social media, Aniston joined Instagram on October 15, 2019, causing the app to ""break"" (for hours the ""follow"" button became inoperable due to an overload of web traffic to her account) with the first picture of a Friends cast reunion. Within five hours and sixteen minutes, she set a Guinness World Record as the fastest person to amass a million followers on the app.[209]\n\nActing credits and awards\n\nAniston has received five Primetime Emmy Award nominations, two Golden Globe Award nominations, and nine SAG Award nominations for her role in Friends. From these, she has won one of each.

I still remember the address - 468 South Roxbury in Beverly Hills.\n\n\'It was supposed to be for Jon\'s production company but Angie ended up living there with a team of nannies.\n\n\'We are talking literally three floors above the one where Marcheline lived with her son Jamie.\n\nAngelina Jolie\'s former nanny Krisann Morel says she is deeply concerned for Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt\'s six children\n\n\'And while her mother\'s apartment was beautifully decorated with expensive antique furniture, Angie\'s place was sparsely furnished with white walls and carpets. I used to call it the Ivory Tower.\n\n\'There were so many helpers that she often had one nanny put her in bed at night and another one to wake her up in the morning.\n\n\'I always thought that must be so unsettling for a child and Marcheline did not spend much time with her daughter during those early years.\n\n\'She told me, ""Angie looks so much like Jon it is hard for me"". She struggled to bond with her daughter in the same way she had with Jamie.\n\n\'But I told her, ""You have to pull it together for the kids"". And that\'s what I want to tell Angie now.\'\n\nJolie blindsided Pitt, 52, when she announced she was filing for divorce amid rumors he had been abusing alcohol and weed and cheating with co-star Marion Cotillard, 40.\n\nVoight and Bertrand\'s 1977 split led to years of heartache and estrangement in the family. For a time, Jolie (pictured left with her father and right with her mother) even cut Voight out of her life\n\nPitt is also being investigated by the FBI for allegedly attacking their 15-year-old son Maddox during a private jet flight over the United States.\n\nSources close to Pitt said that a smear campaign has been launched against him as his ex seeks sole custody of their six children.\n\nAnd Jolie\'s former nanny said that what is going on is all too familiar.\n\nMorel first met the Lara Croft actresses\' mom when she was working as a waitress at the star-studded Rainbow Bar and Grill on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles in 1975.\n\nThey met when Bertrand, who died of breast and ovarian cancer at the age of 56 in 2007, was pregnant with her daughter and struggling to balance her Hollywood career with raising her two-year-old son, James, known as \'Jamie\'.\n\nSpeaking from her home near Las Vegas, Morel said: \'I was in my early 20s and I would often chat with Bertrand and her friends when they came to the restaurant.\n\n\'One night they were stuck between a rock and a hard place finding a babysitter so one of them asked me if I could help out.\n\nJolie\'s older brother, Jamie Haven, is also an actor and producer. They are pictured together at the Golden Globes in 2000\n\n\'I said yes and after that I started working for the family on a regular basis. They had around six nannies in total and none of us were full-time, we just turned up whenever we were asked to and were paid three dollars an hour.\n\n\'I didn\'t think it was a good way to raise children as it meant the kids had this carousel of people around them were not given the consistency they needed.\n\n\'But that was the system Marcheline put in place - and it seems to be the same one Angie has for her children now.\'\n\nJolie\'s father, Voight, 77, an Oscar-winning actor who made his name in hit movies including Midnight Cowboy, made every effort to visit his children after the couple separated in 1977, according to Morel.\n\nBut he was often barred from seeing them by Jolie\'s furious mother, who never recovered from his betrayal when he left her for lover Pickren.\n\nJolie cut her father out of her life after she got her big break in Hollywood and even though they later reconciled, their relationship is said to be strained because she has never fully forgiven him for his cheating.\n\nMorel said: \'Marcheline was devastated and depressed. She had just had a baby and her husband, who she loved, had walked out on her.\n\n\'She often asked me, ""Why did he leave me for her?"" I told her, ""I can\'t answer that"".\n\n\'Marcheline was trying to regain her confidence as she was so deflated. She went to acting classes and was attempting to get her career as an actress going again.\n\n\'I remember there were lots of big names in Hollywood who started to take an interest when she became single again - I once had to deliver a cake from Marcheline to the actor Burt Reynolds.\n\n\'Jon was away working a lot but whenever he was around he made a real effort to see his children. He would call me and say, ""Is Marcheline there, can I come over?"" And it was Jon who made the effort to do normal things with them like take them to the park.\n\nMorel fears that the vicious war that broke out between Jolie\'s mother and father still seems to affect her today, and worries that it could have lasting affects on her and Pitt\'s children\n\n\'I was friends with both Marcheline and Jon, but I\'ve always felt that Jon got the raw end of the deal.\n\n\'Angie\'s mom for instance, hardly ever cooked for her children and they would live off raw foods like avocado.\n\n\'Jon was portrayed as this evil figure and Marcheline succeeded in turning both his children against him. But it led to years of heartbreak and wounds that still haven\'t healed to this day.\n\n\'And I\'m so surprised that Angie is now doing the same thing to her children.\'\n\nMorel quit her job as Jolie\'s nanny when the future star was three years old because she could no longer handle the chaos and bitterness in the house.\n\nAnd her decade-long friendship with mother Bertrand ended in the mid-\'80s when they lost contact.\n\nShe added: \'Angie has abandonment issues that are still being played out now.\n\n\'I don\'t know Brad Pitt but he seems like a good person and he looks just like Jon, so this is an exact repeat of the past.\n\n\'Angie doesn\'t have any concept of what a normal family is like. Brad does, he came from one.'"

"b'Remember when all the Kardashians and Jenners got on and life was much simpler?\n\nUs too. But now the back-and-forth shade between the three Kardashian sisters, Kris Jenner and her ex-husband Caitlyn Jenner is at an all time high.\n\nThrough a timeline of shade, we look back at what\'s been going on with America\'s most famous reality show family.\n\nThe family in 1995 Getty Images\n\nJune 2015: It all starts with the internet-breaking Vanity Fair interview - where she reveals her identity as Caitlyn to the world for the first time. Among the iconic pictures shot by Annie Leibowitz are comments about her relationship with Kris.\n\nVanity Fair\n\nFirstly the two disagree on how much Caitlyn had told Kris about her gender identity issues, the fact she had taken female hormones in the 1980s and also dabbled with cross-dressing.\n\nShe also says the breakdown of their 23-year marriage was down to ""20 per cent gender and 80 per cent [was] the way I was treated"".\n\nKris tells the magazine Caitlyn was ""miserable"" and ""pissed off"" during the last years of their marriage.\n\nAugust 2015: On Caitlyn\'s new E! show, I Am Cait, Khloe is seen visiting Caitlyn where she takes issue with her comments about Kris.\n\nCaitlyn tells Khloe sent her ""tough"" text messages, to which Khloe responds: ""I said we don\'t care what you\'re doing... we want to be there and support you but we don\'t think that entails you speaking negatively about my mum. In our opinion you don\'t even need to mention my mum. Let\'s focus on the actual cause here and not drag my mum through the mud.""\n\nOctober 2015: Season 10 of Keeping up with the Kardashians shows Kris\' reaction to the Vanity Fair interview and she is, shall we say, more explicit with her wording.\n\n""He can go f*** himself,"" she cries down the phone to a deadpan Kim. ""I honestly wish I never met this man. I mean, just f*** you, Bruce.""\n\nCaitlyn and Kris Jenner at the 2015 Victoria\xe2\x80\x99s Secret show Getty Images\n\nKim tells the camera: ""All Caitlyn can talk about is that my mum mistreated her and was awful and all these really rude things, when there\'s no reason to bash my mum.""\n\nNovember 2015: Khloe appears on the Ellen Show saying she had a particularly hard time accepting Caitlyn\'s transition because she found out on camera.\n\n\n\nThis content is imported from YouTube. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.\n\n""We kept asking him, \'Bruce, like what\'s going on? We\'re hearing all these rumours?\' and he kept telling us one thing but really he knew he was transitioning and wouldn\'t be honest with us.\n\n""So really we felt like the last to know so that was hard for us, especially me.""\n\nJanuary 2016: Khloe appears on the Howard Stern Show where she is very candid about a whole lot of things, including Caitlyn.\n\nSaying she found out about Caitlyn\'s transition at the same time that ""business people"" knew, despite repeatedly asking her whether the rumours about her transgender identity were true, she says she felt ""betrayed"".\n\n""We felt so like, \'what the f***? We\'ve been asking you and why do business people know?\' I never want someone to feel like they have one-up on our family. We are a family. We\'ve never turned our backs on each other yet with all the clusterf***s of s*** that\'s happened in our lives, why would we now?\n\n""I don\'t give a f*** what you want to do - just stop lying to us about things... Just lay it on the table, what are we doing? What\'s happening? Even then he didn\'t tell us... we didn\'t know when he was going to start fully dressing as Caitlyn.""\n\nMay 2016: It later turns out that Caitlyn was not ok with what Khloe said on Howard Stern, as was revealed on the season 12 premiere of KUWTK.\n\nAccording to Khloe, she was inundated with angry messages from Caitlyn after the interview so naturally she vented to matriarch Kris:\n\n""I said, \'You slaughtered my mother and you have the nerve to say, \'What happened to family sticking together?\' You jumped that ship as soon as you did Diane Sawyer and attacked my mum\', and instead, [she] tells me to \'get a life\' and \'shut up\' and I\'m like, \'you shut up and you get a f***ing life.\n\n""... She can tell me to f*** off all she wants. I don\'t have a relationship with her. I\'m done.""\n\nLater in the episode, Kris is seen on the phone to Caitlyn trying to sort out the drama.\n\n""She\'s out there talking s*** about me,"" Caitlyn vents to Kris about Khloe (bear with us). ""I don\'t want her talking about me, ok? You don\'t go on Howard Stern and call me a liar.""\n\nAugust 2016: Caitlyn spends Father\'s Day with her youngest daughter Kylie watching basketball games. All seems well until she takes to Snapchat to joke about why Kylie is her favourite daughter.\n\nCaitlyn and Kylie in November, 2015 Getty Images\n\n""Why, because it\'s Father\'s Day and she\'s the only one that invited me over,"" she tells her followers.\n\nAccording to Mail Online, Kim later said the rumours that all the siblings had abandoned Caitlyn on Father\'s Day were not true and that she had actually invited her for brunch.\n\nOctober 2016: Kris and Kim have an almighty row on KUWTK when Kris finds out that her daughter helped Caitlyn get ready for the ESPY awards in July, 2016.\n\nWhen Kim tells her mother she wanted to stay neutral between the estranged couple, Kris yells: ""I want loyalty. I don\'t want f***ing neutral. I\'m trying to be as gracious as I can, I\'m trying to be as understanding as I can. I\'m betrayed. I\'ve been f***ed over on so many levels that your head would spin.""\n\nApril 2017: Things well and truly kick off when Caitlyn Jenner\'s tell-all book The Secrets of My Life is released.\n\nHere\'s a very brief rundown of the biggest reveals in it:\n\nCaitlyn says Kris had control over all the money the couple made from the show.\n\nApparently it was Caitlyn who came up with the idea of the show, not Kris. Ouch.\n\nShe says Kendall is the most down-to-earth of all the girls.\n\nThe Kardashians were not largely included in the Diane Sawyer documentary - which saw Caitlyn come out as transgender for the first time - because ""research shows that whenever a Kardashian is on television, many in the public tend to think it is a publicity stunt to make money"". Eek.\n\nThe Kardashians read the memoir and are not at all happy. In an episode of KUWTK Kris claims: ""Everything that she says is made up"" and claims the only nice thing Caitlyn had to say about her is that she\'s great at parties.\n\n""I\'ve never been so angry and disappointed in somebody in my whole life,"" Kris vented.\n\nThis content is imported from YouTube.

You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.\n\n""It\'s taken her a really long time to be honest with herself so I don\'t expect her to be honest with my Mum now. It\'s just so hurtful. I wish her all the success in the world but not at our expense,"" she says.\n\nCaitlyn also does another show with Diane Sawyer, where she says: ""Some [of my children] I have remained very close to. A couple of them... I\'m a little more distant. I have to admit, I\'ll sit here and wonder, \'Is it because of my transitioning? Or is it because their life is so busy that they don\'t call, like all the time?\'... Nobody calls that much. I mostly reach out to them. Obviously the Jenner side call more, but they have their own lives.""\n\nMay 2017: Kim appears on \'Plead the Fifth\' on Watch What Happens Live where Andy Cohen asks her the chances of Kris and Caitlyn ever speaking again.\n\nThis content is imported from YouTube. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.\n\n""Zero, one, no, two per cent and those are Kendall and Kylie. All fair, I think,"" she said casually.\n\nOn KUWTK later in the month, Kim tells Kourtney that, in her book, Caitlyn is ""so angry with mum for no reason"".\n\nThis content is imported from YouTube. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.\n\nKourtney chimes in on Caitlyn\'s claim that the Kardashians were excluded from the Diane Sawyer documentary because the name is associated with publicity stunts, adding: ""That sounds pathetic.""\n\nJune 2017: For the first time, Caitlyn\'s daughter Kendall also wades in on the book on KUWTK where she\'s seen slamming the table in frustration.\n\nThis content is imported from YouTube. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.\n\n""I spoke to Kim about Dad\'s book and heard about all the stuff she was saying in it and how a lot of it is so not true,"" Kendall tells her mum Kris. ""The weird part is I don\'t think it\'s purposeful lying, I think she really just thinks that\'s what happened... and then she goes around dissing the Kardashians but those are the kids that you raised, if you have a problem with them you raised them.\n\n""It makes no sense to me that she would go around bashing them for no reason, that\'s insane.""\n\nKris calls the book a ""fabrication"" a few times, too.\n\nKim is also back again on the book, saying she has ""no respect"" for Caitlyn anymore.\n\nKendall, Caitlyn and Kylie Jenner in June, 2017 Getty Images\n\nAugust 2017: In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Kris rebukes the claim that it was Caitlyn who came up with the premise for the reality show that made the family the superstars they are today.\n\n""It\'s so absurd,"" Kris says. ""I\'m not sure what the motivation was for her to say something like that. Maybe somebody should remind her it\'s called Keeping up with the Kardashians.""\n\nOooo. Burn.\n\nSeptember 2017: In the premiere of season 14 of KUWTK, Kim takes aim with another part of Caitlyn\'s book which suggested that her dad - the late Robert Kardashian who defended his friend OJ Simpson in the infamous 1992 murder trial - at one point believed OJ to be guilty.\n\n""I have always had Caitlyn\'s back,"" Kim says. ""She is a liar. She is not a good person.""\n\n\n\nCaitlyn then tells Good Morning Britain that she and Kim have not spoken in nine months.\n\n""I love Kim so much, it\'s such a huge loss in my life not having her there anymore,"" she tells Piers Morgan and Susanna Reid. ""It\'s really sad.""\n\nShe adds that ""the Kardashians, particularly Kris, didn\'t react that way [being proud of her book] even though I went overboard to be nice and friendly"".\n\nOctober 2017: The Kardashian siblings continue airing their thoughts on Caitlyn\'s book on KUWTK when Kim finds out about Caitlyn\'s gender reassignment surgery through the media.\n\nKhloe does not hold back with her comments - while on a private jet flying to Cleveland (as they do) - claiming that Caitlyn plays the victim.\n\nThis content is imported from YouTube. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.\n\n""I\'m the victim, I\'m the victim, they don\'t want to see me. Oh f*** off and it\'s not because you\'re trans,"" Khloe vents. ""That\'s not why I\'m not talking to you. I\'m not talking to you because you\'re a bad, mean person.""\n\nOoof.\n\nNovember 2017: Caitlyn\'s Jenner gives a talk at Cambridge University\'s union, and says the Kardashians have hurt her badly.\n\n""It\'s been a little bit tough over the last couple of years on the Kardashian side,"" she says - which, in light of the above, is a bit of an understatement. She says she hasn\'t spoken to Kim in over a year and other recent reports in the The Sun claim she hasn\'t talked to Khloe in two years.\n\n""They don\'t want me in their lives, they bashed me pretty badly. It\'s devastating when your kids do that. It really hurt... In the book I express some opinions and got shot down. It was not about the Kardashians. They were only mentioned on 20 pages. They made it more about them on television. The book was about my life. That\'s caused a lot of the separation between us.""\n\nDecember 2017: Caitlyn reveals on Piers Morgan\'s Life Stories that she didn\'t trust his ex-wife or step-children with news of her gender reassignment surgery, as she thought they\'d leak it to the press.\n\n""They didn\xe2\x80\x99t know that you had actually had the surgery?"", Morgan asked, when Jenner admitted to sending Kim a preview copy of her memoir The Secrets Of My Life, but removing the section about her surgery.\n\n""No I didn\xe2\x80\x99t tell anybody. Why? It\xe2\x80\x99s none of their business"", Jenner responded. ""It\xe2\x80\x99s not that big a deal. Nobody knows. I had to be honest, the book is about honesty. It\xe2\x80\x99s called The Secrets Of My Life. No it really wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a big deal. I had already been living as Caitlyn for a year and a half, ok, nobody knows anything. Because I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want them to leak it to the press. There was no reason for them to know about it.\n\nAsked if she didn\xe2\x80\x99t trust the Kardashians, she replied: \xe2\x80\x98Of course not \xe2\x80\x93 of course I didn\xe2\x80\x99t trust them.\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\n\nOlivia Blair Digital News Editor Olivia is ELLE\'s Digital News Editor covering pop culture, royal, lifestyle and women\'s news and features.\n\nThis content is created and maintained by a third party, and imported onto this page to help users provide their email addresses.

"b'Margot Robbie Net Worth and Salary: Margot Robbie is an Australian actress who has a net worth of $26 million. Robbie has developed quite the reputation since appearing on the scene, and she\'s considered one of the most influential figures in Hollywood today. As of 2019, she is also one of the highest-paid actresses in the world. Thanks to a string of brilliant performances in a number of films, Margot Robbie has received considerable praise from critics, and she has been nominated for a number of Academy Awards.\n\nAlthough Robbie began her career in Australia, she gained widespread recognition after moving to the United States. Over the years, she has exhibited incredible range, playing drastically different characters \xe2\x80\x93 many of which have been historical figures in biopics. Outside of acting, Robbie is a successful producer who has collaborated with her husband, Tom Ackerly, to create the production company LuckyChap Entertainment.\n\nEarly Life: Margot Elise Robbie was born on July 2nd of 1990 in Dalby, Queensland. Raised by a single mother on the Gold Coast alongside three siblings, Margot spent much of her childhood living on the family farm. By the age of 16, Robbie was working three jobs at the same time in order to provide for her family. This included working at Subway. She also managed to juggle her growing passion for acting and studied drama at Somerset College. At the age of 17, Margot moved to Melbourne in order to pursue a career as an actress.\n\nCareer: Robbie began her career with roles in Australian films such as ""ICU"" and ""Vigilante."" She later started appearing in Australian commercials and landed guest roles in shows like ""The Elephant Princess"" and ""City Homicide."" A major step forward came in 2008 when she booked a recurring role on the well-known Australian soap opera ""Neighbours.""\n\nAfter appearing in a number of other Australian projects, Robbie flew to Los Angeles for pilot season. She auditioned for a number of roles but initially failed to make an impact. Switching gears, Robbie booked a role in a British romantic comedy called ""About Time,"" which released in 2013 and helped put Margot on the map. However, her real breakthrough came later that year when she appeared in Martin Scorsese\'s ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" alongside Leonardo DiCaprio. The film was a commercial and critical success, earning over $392 million at the box office. Robbie was also singled out for praise, impressing many critics with her accurate Brooklyn accent.\n\nAfter founding her own production company, she appeared in ""Focus"" alongside Will Smith. The film received mixed reviews, although Robbie\'s performance received praise. She also earned critical acclaim for her role in the New Zealand film ""Z for Zachariah."" Throughout the next few years, Robbie appeared in films like ""Suite Francaise,"" ""The Big Short,"" ""Whiskey Tango Foxtrot,"" and ""The Legend of Tarzan.""\n\nAnother important role came in 2016 when Margot appeared as Harley Quinn in ""Suicide Squad."" Negative reviews followed, but Robbie\'s performance was a silver lining in the eyes of most critics. She followed up with a role in ""Goodbye Christopher Robin"" before portraying Tonya Harding in ""I, Tonya."" This became one of her most celebrated roles thus far. In 2018, she established herself as a voice actor after booking the role of Flopsy Rabbit in the animated/live-action film ""Peter Rabbit.""\n\nHer next film projects included ""Terminal"" and ""Slaughterhouse Rulez"" before she appeared as Queen Elizabeth I in ""Mary Queen of Scots."" In 2019, she appeared in ""Dreamland"" and ""Once Upon a Time in Hollywood,"" following through with her goal of working with director Quentin Tarantino. She wrapped up 2019 with a role in ""Bombshell"" before starting 2020 with the film ""Promising Young Woman."" In 2020, she reprised her role as Harley Quinn in ""Birds of Prey.""\n\nBrand Endorsements: Margot Robbie has supplemented her acting income with a range of brand endorsements and deals. In 2016, she became the face of Calvin Klein\'s Deep Euphoria fragrance. One year later, she began to appear in Nissan commercials for its line of electric vehicles (EVs). Robbie followed up in 2018 by becoming the brand ambassador for Chanel, a well-known luxury fashion brand. Robbie has worked with Chanel extensively, and she eventually became the face of their fragrance ""Chanel Gabrielle Essence."" Many publications have complimented Robbie\'s sense of fashion, and she is considered one of the best-dressed celebrities of the modern era.\n\nRelationships: In 2014, Margot Robbie started dating Tom Ackerly, an assistant director she had met on the set of a film called ""Suite Francaise."" In 2016, they were married. After living together in London with a number of other housemates, they relocated to Los Angeles.\n\nReal Estate: Margot has been quite active in the real estate market since becoming a prominent Hollywood figure. In 2017, she quietly purchased a property in the Hancock Park neighborhood of Los Angeles. The low-key purchase was only discovered months after Robbie had moved in, and she reportedly paid $2.73 million for the impressive property. The 3,300-square-foot residence features a wine cellar, a pool, a private balcony, and a room dedicated to Margot\'s newly-adopted puppy.\n\nRobbie followed up with a string of purchases in 2019. During this year, she purchased not one but two houses for her family members. The first home went to her sister, while the second was given to Margot\'s mother. Both homes are part of the same building, and Robbie paid about $1.8 million for the gated duplex which sits along Australia\'s beautiful Gold Coast. In 2014, she paid off her mother\'s mortgage as a 60th birthday present.\n\nAlso during 2019, Robbie splurged on a second home for herself. This time the successful actress shopped in the Venice neighborhood of Los Angeles, paying $5 million for a compound in another quiet deal. The compound actually contains three separate structures, and has been described as ""fortress-like."" There\'s also a grassy lawn and a pool with plenty of privacy. In addition, Robbie owns a 1,000-square-foot investment home in Hollywood Hills that she leases out for considerable passive income.\n\nIncome Details: Between September 2018 and September 2019, Margot earned $24 million from her various endeavors. This was enough to make her one of the highest-paid actresses in the world during that period.'"

I say, \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s Jennifer.\xe2\x80\x99 He says, \xe2\x80\x98You look so beautiful.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShe and I are sitting on a stone patio at Lopez\xe2\x80\x99s new house in Bel Air, overlooking an infinity pool and a lush green lawn with a double-size swing, which she points out is perfect for her nine-year-old twins, Emme and Max. The house is light-filled, sprawling, and warm, with wood-beamed ceilings, stone walls, plush low-slung sofas, big pillows, bowls filled with cut roses, and artwork by collagist Peter Tunney. \xe2\x80\x9cGRATTITUD\xc6\x8e,\xe2\x80\x9d one piece spells out. It\xe2\x80\x99s a portmanteau of \xe2\x80\x9cgratitude\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cattitude\xe2\x80\x9d that could define Lopez. Wearing a cropped turtleneck sweater, skinny jeans, high Christian Louboutin boots, and impressive diamond earrings, she is as startlingly beautiful at 48 as she was at 28\xe2\x80\x94if not more so. \xe2\x80\x9cWe walked into this house, and I said, \xe2\x80\x98This is where I want my kids to grow up,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d she says. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have to imagine your life, and what you want to be in it, and I imagined we would be very happy here no matter what.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHappy, naturally, has turned out differently from what she imagined. Just hours after Rodriguez met her in Beverly Hills, he called her, and they agreed to have dinner a few nights later. She told him that she remembered meeting him on a baseball diamond, 12 years earlier. Her then husband, Marc Anthony, had thrown out the first pitch of a New York Mets game, but the cameras captured Lopez and Rodriguez shaking hands and locking eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t have to say you remember if you don\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d she told him. \xe2\x80\x9cShea Stadium, during a subway series,\xe2\x80\x9d he responded.\n\nJust then, Rodriguez walks out of the house to join us on the patio. \xe2\x80\x9cI was telling her about the tap,\xe2\x80\x9d she says to him. \xe2\x80\x9cBut there were two taps,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. She turns to me. \xe2\x80\x9cThere was another very significant tap on the shoulder,\xe2\x80\x9d she says.\n\nBefore we get to that tap, we talk about their first date, when they met for dinner at the Hotel Bel Air. \xe2\x80\x9cHe was sitting there in his white shirt, very confident and manly, but then he was just so talkative!\xe2\x80\x9d she says. \xe2\x80\x9cI think he thought I was going to be this loud person, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not. I just listen. So he\xe2\x80\x99s talking, talking about his plans, about how he had just retired from baseball, about how he saw himself getting married again, all these things you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t normally talk about on a first date. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if he thought it was a date. I thought it was a date. Then I knew he was nervous because he asked me if I wanted a drink. I said, \xe2\x80\x98No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t drink,\xe2\x80\x99 and he asked if I minded if he had one. He was nervous, and it was really cute.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t know if it was a date,\xe2\x80\x9d Rodriguez says. \xe2\x80\x9cMaybe we were seeing each other at night because of her work schedule. I went in uneasy, not knowing her situation.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe continues: \xe2\x80\x9cIt would be incredibly productive for me to sit with one of the smartest, greatest women in the world, especially for a guy like me who is coming through tough times, rehabbing himself, re-establishing himself to folks out there. I thought it would be a win-win no matter what.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThen: \xe2\x80\x9cShe told me around the third or fourth inning that she was single,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cI had to get up and go re-adjust my thoughts. I went to the bathroom and got enough courage to send her a text.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo I\xe2\x80\x99m sitting there and he\xe2\x80\x99s walking back, and I get a text,\xe2\x80\x9d Lopez continues. \xe2\x80\x9cIt says . . . \xe2\x80\x9d She looks significantly at Rodriguez. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can tell her!\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9c \xe2\x80\x98You look sexy AF,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d she tells me. They both laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd then it took a turn,\xe2\x80\x9d Lopez says. \xe2\x80\x9cThe fire alarm went off, and we had to evacuate.\xe2\x80\x9d I laugh, thinking she\xe2\x80\x99s being metaphorical. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, really,\xe2\x80\x9d she says. \xe2\x80\x9cThe fire alarm went off!\xe2\x80\x9d'"

"b'Postby Guest \xc2\xbb Wed May 02, 2018 1:05 pm\n\nBy Andrew Shuster | 3:29 pm, May 1, 2018\n\n\n\nA tabloid report claiming Brad Pitt is seeking advice from George Clooney on his supposed romance with Neri Oxman is completely made-up. As Gossip Cop has repeatedly stressed, the movie star isn\xe2\x80\x99t dating the MIT professor, so this entire story is based on a lie.\n\n\n\nAccording to Woman\xe2\x80\x99s Day, Pitt is inspired by Clooney\xe2\x80\x99s marriage to wife Amal, a human rights lawyer who works completely outside of Hollywood. Oxman is an architecture professor who also has no ties to the movie industry, so Pitt supposedly asked his friend how to keep her interested once his star power wears off.\n\n\n\nAs the story goes, Clooney would rather tease his friend than offer him guidance. A so-called \xe2\x80\x9csource\xe2\x80\x9d tells the magazine, \xe2\x80\x9cGeorge loves that Brad has been thrown off his game and makes fun of him endlessly. It\xe2\x80\x99s sweet payback for all the jokes Brad tossed his way after George started dating Amal.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe outlet\xe2\x80\x99s questionable insider goes on to say that although Clooney has been messing with Pitt, Amal has actually been \xe2\x80\x9cadvising Neri on ways to keep calm and grounded amid the media circus.\xe2\x80\x9d The seemingly nonexistent tipster further contends that Pitt \xe2\x80\x9cis very grateful\xe2\x80\x9d for Amal because \xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x99s not used to having a non-famous girlfriend and Neri never expected to be in the limelight.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe tabloid\xe2\x80\x99s article, however, is nothing more than fan fiction. Pitt\xe2\x80\x99s rep has told us on the record several times that the actor isn\xe2\x80\x99t dating Oxman. This has been backed up by trusted publications such as People, which recently noted Pitt and Oxman have a \xe2\x80\x9cprofessional friendship,\xe2\x80\x9d as while as E! News, which similarly reported that Pitt and Oxman are \xe2\x80\x9cstrictly friends.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThis article only seems to exist because Woman\xe2\x80\x99s Day came up with a way to drag Clooney into his pal\xe2\x80\x99s imaginary romance. In addition to the fact that Pitt and Oxman aren\xe2\x80\x99t a couple, a mutual pal of ours and Clooney tells us on background that the actor\xe2\x80\x99s friend hasn\xe2\x80\x99t turned to him for advice about dating the MIT professor. This is just a fabricated story based on a phony premise.\n\n\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s worth noting, this isn\xe2\x80\x99t the first time Gossip Cop has had to debunk a bogus story about Clooney supposedly playing a role in his friend\xe2\x80\x99s love life. We recently busted New Idea for making up a story about Clooney getting Pitt and Jennifer Aniston back together. This latest article involving Oxman is equally untrue.'"
"b'Tom Cruise has seemingly been all about his movie career since his high-profile marriage to Katie Holmes met its demise. The action star has steadily starred in film after film, yet has been at the center of several dating rumors.\n\nAs the International Business Times reports, \xe2\x80\x9cThe actor was mistakenly linked to an Australian journalist and then was associated to his Mission: Impossible 6 co-star and Crown actress Vanessa Kirby.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAll rumors until now have been stamped out as false.\n\nHowever, the latest claims include those stating that members of the Church of Scientology have once again been playing matchmaker for the Top Gun star and that Cruise has reportedly been secretly dating over the past little while. Interestingly enough, Tom has reportedly been using a disguise to enjoy dates with the ladies, much like Katie Holmes did in the initial stages of her romance with Jamie Foxx.\n\nA source told the publication about Cruise\xe2\x80\x99s tactics to keep his love life out of the spotlight.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTom\xe2\x80\x99s back on the dating scene, but nobody knows it\xe2\x80\x99s him. His face is way too recognizable for him to stroll into the bars, so he has his makeup artist create a silicone mask. Seems like Tom took his Mission: Impossible role to heart. It\xe2\x80\x99s just what Ethan Hunt would do in the movies.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s also been claimed that the disguise, which includes makeup, takes a full five hours to apply. If this rumor all sounds a little far-fetched, that\xe2\x80\x99s because it is completely untrue, according to Gossip Cop. Tom Cruise does not go through some elaborate process to secretly step out on dates. In fact, there has not been any confirmation that Tom Cruise has dated anyone since Katie Holmes.\n\nKatie Holmes, however, continues to attempt to keep her romance with Jamie Foxx a secret, despite the fact that the pair has been spotted on numerous occasions over the past year on beach getaways and romantic locales like Paris. Most recently the mysterious duo were spotted celebrating Jamie\xe2\x80\x99s 50th birthday at a Santa Monica beach hotel last week, as Page Six relays.\n\nKatie Holmes and Jamie Foxx were spotted on another romantic beach getaway https://t.co/ZwdutxFdYe pic.twitter.com/dhoszJ2wg3 \xe2\x80\x94 Travel + Leisure (@TravelLeisure) December 19, 2017\n\nOnlookers at the hotel stated that the duo appeared to be quite awkward while Katie kept looking around cautiously. The couple was also seen walking along the beach while Foxx had his arm around the beauty. This report is similar to the one earlier this year that stated Katie Holmes and Jamie Foxx were spotted strolling along the beach hand-in-hand in Malibu.'"

"b'Lionsgate\n\nWell, this is a nice surprise. Halle Berry just dropped word via Instagram that the actress will be joining the cast of the third John Wick flick. Penned by Derek Kolstad and directed by Chad Stahelski, the (presumably) final chapter in the Keanu Reeves action franchise is set to open on May 17, 2019. I have no idea if Berry is playing a villain or a fellow anti-hero, but A) it\'s cool that the (presumed) female lead will be about as old the male lead (she is 51 and he is 53, neither of them looks a day over 27) and B) I\'m a huge fan of Berry\'s recent pulp fiction endeavors (The Call and Kidnap), so this is pretty cool casting.\n\nLionsgate also just announced that Angelica Houston, Asia Kate Dillon (TVs Billions and Orange is the New Black), Mark Dacascos (Lucky Day, Hawaii 5-0, Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.), and Jason Mantzoukas (The Long Dumb Road, The House) will join the cast of John Wick: Chapter 3. Yes, Laurence Fishburne, Ian McShane and Lance Reddick will return as well. I\'m not sure if Ruby Rose survived her encounters with Mr. Wick in part two, but I kinda hope she comes back too. What this arguably means is that Lionsgate may end up emphasizing an ensemble cast this time out, as opposed to the first two films which were (understandably) the Keanu Reeves Show.\n\nThat\'s no shade on Mr. Wick or the actor who plays him, but as I noted in the last post about the Mission: Impossible franchise, there is perhaps a greater value, at least for overseas box office, in ensemble action flicks as opposed to solo/lone-wolf movies. Think Deadpool 2, xXx: Return of Xander Cage, Fate of the Furious and Avengers: Infinity War. Even Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle was sold as a four-person adventure, highlighting Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart, Jack Black and Karen Gillan.\n\nSo, if Lionsgate feels that they can get more overseas bucks the third-go around (John Wick: Chapter 2 made $92 million domestic and $79m overseas) by offering something resembling an ensemble cast, well, that\'s one option on the table. That doesn\'t mean that John Wick will go about recruit a super-assassin squad to deal with that pesky ""everyone wants to kill me now"" status quo from the end of the last John Wick, but I will be interested to see how these new cast members are integrated into the new movie. And yeah, bringing Halle Berry onboard is a nice touch.\n\nCome what may, John Wick: Chapter 3 opens next year. Even as someone who thought that John Wick: Chapter 2 ended on a pretty definitive note (not unlike The Dark Knight or The Last Jedi), I\'m still curious to see what the Wick crew has up their sleeve for a threequel.'"

According to Us Weekly, her party happened at Soho Farmhouse in Oxfordshire, with E! reporting that it was ""just a relaxing day of good food and pampering.""\n\nBut it\'s believed that Prince Harry\'s bachelor party, or ""stag do"" as the Brits would call it, has yet to happen. Here\'s everything we know about the royal party so far:\n\n1) The Organizers.\n\nAccording to Vanity Fair, Prince Harry ""has put his brother, Prince William, and his best friend Tom Inskip in charge of his all-important sending-off party."" As Prince William is the best man at his brother\'s wedding, he\'ll likely be the steering force in helping to plan a night to remember.\n\nAnthony Harvey/REX/Shutterstock\n\n2) The Location.\n\nPrince Harry\'s best friend, Inskip, has apparently been spotted scouting out possible venues for the bachelor party to end all bachelor parties. Vanity Fair reports that the venue of choice is likely to be a ""suitably swanky boutique hotel in Mexico."" A ""friend"" reportedly revealed the the publication:\n\n\n\n""Tom is in charge of finding the location. It has to be somewhere they won\xe2\x80\x99t be found and a place they can completely take over. Tom was checking out this fabulous place in Mexico last week and he loved it. It might be a step too far for everyone to go to Mexico but it\'s one of the places on the wish list.""\n\nHowever, back in January, the Daily Mail reported that the bachelor party was probably going to take place at ""Swiss ski resort of Verbier, after royal protection officers were spotted in the upmarket bar La Vache."" The Daily Star reiterated this plan, claiming that Prince Andrew had offered the group his ski chalet to hold the party in.\n\n3) The Entertainment.\n\nDon\'t expect any debauchery at Prince Harry\'s bachelor party. As most people have noticed, the royal has become ""a lot tamer and less of a party boy"" since meeting Markle. As such, his bachelor party is unlikely to get as raucous as parties he\'s attended in the past.\n\nAnd when it comes to alcohol, Prince Harry is a lot more restrained than he used to be. As Vanity Fair reports, ""He smokes less, although Meghan hasn\xe2\x80\x99t yet managed to get him to quit smoking, and he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t drink as much. He\xe2\x80\x99s determined that there will be no repeats of Vegas on this stag do."" The royals are likely hoping to keep any parties out of the papers, and away from prying eyes.\n\nThis content is created and maintained by a third party, and imported onto this page to help users provide their email addresses.

"b'American television personality\n\nRegis Francis Xavier Philbin ( ; August 25, 1931 \xe2\x80\x93 July 24, 2020) was an American television presenter, talk show host, game show host, actor[1] and singer. Once called ""the hardest working man in show business"",[2] he holds the Guinness World Record for the most hours on U.S. television.[3]\n\nAfter graduating from the University of Notre Dame, Philbin served in the U.S. Navy and got his television start serving as a page for The Tonight Show in the 1950s. He got his first network TV exposure in 1967 as Joey Bishop\'s sidekick on The Joey Bishop Show. He is most widely known as the co-host of the New York City-based nationally syndicated talk show Live! with Regis and Kathie Lee, starting in 1988, which became Live! with Regis and Kelly in 2001, and continued as Live! with Kelly after Philbin\'s departure in 2011.[4]\n\nPhilbin debuted and hosted the US version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,[4] Million Dollar Password,[5] and the first season of America\'s Got Talent.[6]\n\nEarly life [ edit ]\n\nRegis Francis Xavier Philbin[7][8][9] was born in the Manhattan borough of New York City on August 25, 1931.[10] His father, Francis ""Frank"" Philbin, was a U.S. Marine of Irish descent who served in the Pacific.[11] His mother, Filomena (""Florence""; n\xc3\xa9e Bashia), was a member of an Albanian-Italian immigrant family from Greci.[9] Philbin had a Catholic upbringing.[11] He was supposedly named ""Regis"" because his father wanted him to attend his alma mater, the prestigious Regis High School.[10] It was long believed that he was an only child, but he announced on Live with Regis and Kelly in February 2007 that he had a brother named Frank (March 1, 1951 \xe2\x80\x93 January 27, 2007), who had died from non-Hodgkin lymphoma several days earlier.[10][12] Philbin said his brother had asked not to be mentioned on television or in the press while still alive to protect his privacy.[13]\n\nPhilbin was raised in the Van Nest neighborhood of the Bronx.[14] He attended Our Lady of Solace grammar school[15] and graduated from Cardinal Hayes High School[7] before attending the University of Notre Dame, from which he graduated in 1953 with a degree in sociology.[12] He later served in the U.S. Navy as a supply officer Lieutenant Junior Grade (the equivalent of First Lieutenant in other U.S. military branches)[16] and then went through a few behind-the-scenes jobs in television and radio before moving into broadcasting.[12]\n\nCareer [ edit ]\n\nEarly work [ edit ]\n\nIn his earliest show business work, Philbin was a page at The Tonight Show in 1955.[17] Later he wrote for Los Angeles-based talk show host Tom Duggan and nervously filled in one night when the hard-drinking Duggan didn\'t show up.[18] He also was an announcer on The Tonight Show in 1962.[1] In 1957, Regis left his job as assistant news editor to Baxter Ward at KCOP, Los Angeles, to make his fortune in New York City. His replacement at KCOP was George Van Valkenburg.[citation needed]\n\nHis first talk show was The Regis Philbin Show[7] in 1961 on KOGO-TV (now KGTV) in San Diego.[19] For financial reasons, he had no writing staff, so he began each show with what became his hallmark, the ""host chat"" segment (influenced by Jack Paar), where he engaged his audience (and later his co-host) in discussions about his life and the day\'s events.[19] In 1964, Westinghouse Broadcasting picked up Philbin\'s talk show for national syndication in the late night time slot (replacing Steve Allen).[19] That Regis Philbin Show failed to attract many stations and Westinghouse replaced Philbin with Merv Griffin in 1965.\n\nTalk shows [ edit ]\n\nIn 1964, Philbin hosted That Regis Philbin Show, a nationally syndicated show for Westinghouse Broadcasting replacing The Steve Allen Show after Steve Allen refused to renew his contract.[20] The audience did not accept Philbin as a replacement for Allen\'s zany antics and the appearance lasted only a little over four months because of dismal ratings, especially compared to Johnny Carson in the same time slot. Nevertheless, Philbin has cited Carson as an influence.[21]\n\nPhilbin gained his first network TV exposure in 1967 as Joey Bishop\'s sidekick on The Joey Bishop Show[19] on television (1967\xe2\x80\x931969). In a Johnny Carson-Ed McMahon vein, Bishop would playfully tease Philbin and he would take the barbs in stride. But his feelings were hurt when he learned from the network grapevine that ABC executives were dissatisfied with his work and his thick accent, so during the opening of one 1968 program, he launched an unplanned diatribe about ""not being wanted and letting down"" the program and abruptly quit on air. A few nights later, assured by Bishop that all was well and the barbs were not personal, Philbin returned. As revealed in his 1995 book, I\'m Only One Man!, this was actually a publicity stunt planned by Bishop and Philbin beforehand.[22] He reiterates this assertion in his 2011 memoir, How I Got This Way, explaining that it was intended to draw in some of Johnny Carson\'s viewers.[23] When The Joey Bishop Show was canceled, Bishop returned the favor and walked off the show on the air unannounced, leaving Philbin to carry the night on his own.[24] A 1978 book called The Great 1960s Quiz, authored by Dan Carlinsky (pub. Harper & Row), asked, ""Who was Regis Philbin?"" (p. 7) The answer was ""Joey Bishop\'s sidekick on his late night show."" (p. 124)[25]\n\nDuring the early 1970s, Philbin co-hosted Tempo on Los Angeles station KHJ-TV (now KCAL-TV). He also commuted on weekends to St. Louis, where he filmed Regis Philbin\'s Saturday Night in St. Louis[26] on KMOX-TV (now KMOV).\n\nFrom 1975 to 1981, he co-hosted A.M. Los Angeles, a local morning talk show on KABC-TV,[26] where Philbin was already working reviewing movies for newscasts on the station. He co-hosted first with Sarah Purcell (1975 to 1978), then with Cyndy Garvey (1978 to 1981).[26] Philbin\'s presence brought the show from the bottom of the local ratings to No. 1.[27]\n\nFrom November 30, 1981 to April 9, 1982, Philbin and Mary Hart co-hosted ""The Regis Philbin Show,"" a national morning variety series for NBC. Philbin was hoping to transfer his success from KABC to a national network show, but the show was not successful and lasted only 18 weeks.[28] During 1982 to 1988, Philbin hosted the shows Health Styles [29] and Lifestyles with Regis Philbin [30] on the Cable Health Network and its successor, the Lifetime television network.\n\nAfter Garvey left Los Angeles in 1982 and moved to New York City,[26] Philbin rejoined her on The Morning Show,[26] on WABC-TV starting on April 4,1983.[26] At the time, the 9 am time slot for WABC suffered from low Nielsen ratings because of competition from WNBC-TV\'s Donahue and WCBS-TV\'s game show block featuring The Joker\'s Wild and Tic Tac Dough. After Garvey left again and Ann Abernathy briefly shared co-hosting duties, Philbin was paired with Kathie Lee Johnson (later Gifford), in June 1985, and ratings improved significantly. The show became nationally syndicated on September 5, 1988 as Live! with Regis and Kathie Lee[26] and the success continued. The program replaced A.M. Los Angeles upon its cancellation in 1991 and was eventually picked up by all of the ABC owned-and-operated stations except for WLS in Chicago, which aired The Oprah Winfrey Show in that time slot and had done so since the show\'s debut as A.M. Chicago.[citation needed]\n\nWhen Gifford departed in 2000,[31] the show was temporarily named Live! with Regis.[31] Philbin had guest co-hosts until a replacement was found.[31] Philbin won a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Talk Show Host in 2001.[31] Kelly Ripa was chosen as the permanent co-host in February 2001, and the show was renamed Live! with Regis and Kelly.[31] Their chemistry proved to be successful as the show continued to enjoy high ratings.[32]\n\nPhilbin set a Guinness World Record for ""Most Hours on Camera"" on his August 20, 2004, Live show (replacing Hugh Downs), which gave him a total of 15,188 hours on television.[3]\n\nRegis Philbin in 2009\n\nIn 2008, Philbin\'s contract with ABC was renewed through 2011.[33] Under this contract, Philbin reportedly earned more than US $21 million per annum. He received a similar contract with CBS for hosting Million Dollar Password.[33]\n\nPhilbin departed Live with Regis and Kelly after hosting his final show on November 18, 2011.[34]\n\nGame shows [ edit ]\n\nPhilbin was also a game show host. He hosted The Neighbors, a short-lived game show on ABC from late 1975 to early 1976. The show had two female contestants guessing which of her three women neighbors said gossipy things about her.[1] In 1976, he was a ""field reporter"" for ABC\'s Almost Anything Goes, an American adaptation of the British game show, It\'s a Knockout.[35]\n\nPhilbin was the original host of the U.S. version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire, an ABC game show that had its roots in Britain. Millionaire was a big ratings success in its 1999 debut, when it was intended as an occasional special series. ABC aired Millionaire as a regular series with frequent episodes, but its viewership slowly declined. After Millionaire was canceled, it was retooled in 2002 as a syndicated series hosted by Meredith Vieira. ABC brought back Millionaire in 2004 with Philbin, retitled Who Wants to Be a Super Millionaire, a related series that was aired on a more limited basis. Philbin had appeared in 11 episodes of a special edition of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire, which started on August 9, 2009, 10th anniversary of the show.[36] He also was a celebrity contestant in this version. Millionaire, in its syndicated format, uses guest hosts for selected weeks during the season and Philbin hosted a week of episodes that aired in November 2009, coinciding with his 2009 surgery.[37]\n\nPhilbin\'s Millionaire hosting duties won him a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Game Show Host in 2001. In a 2007 Time article, he was listed among the 15 Best Game Show Hosts in History.[38] When Millionaire was honored on GSN\'s Gameshow Hall of Fame special, Philbin\'s tenure as the show\'s host was praised. Leigh Hampton, then executive producer of the syndicated version, said that he ""[knew] when to take rein of it and when to sit back and let the contestant be the contestant,""[39] and Jennifer Slater of twogirlsandatv.com called him ""the sweetest man on television.""[39] Philbin himself recalled his own Millionaire tenure on said special with the following statement:[39]\n\nYou could only have a minute or two with it before the questions began. I did everything I could to make them more available for the right answer. \xe2\x80\x94 Regis Philbin\n\nIn November 2005, ABC announced that Philbin would host the network\'s revival of This Is Your Life. In August 2006, he reported that his option on the contract for the show had lapsed and he declined to renew it.[40]\n\nPhilbin hosted the first season of America\'s Got Talent, a Simon Cowell-produced amateur talent search show on NBC, during the summer of 2006. He flew between New York City and Los Angeles during that time period to participate in both Live with Regis and Kelly and AGT. Because of his difficulty with commuting cross country and his health problems, he was replaced in 2007 by talk show host Jerry Springer.[41] With regard to filling Philbin\'s spot, Springer noted that ""no one fills in for Regis. He\'s the best there ever was at this so you pay homage to him.""[42]\n\nPhilbin\'s affiliation with Fremantle started to develop at this time. He hosted a revival of the Password franchise entitled Million Dollar Password, which premiered June 1, 2008, and ended on June 14, 2009.[43]\n\nOther television [ edit ]\n\nOn December 31, 2004, Philbin filled in for Dick Clark on ABC\'s Dick Clark\'s New Year\'s Rockin\' Eve, as Clark was recovering from a stroke. Philbin (who was a year and a half younger than Clark) lightheartedly claimed to have interrupted his previously planned vacation to do the show.[44] The following year, Philbin hosted a competing special for Fox, replacing Clark\'s new co-host and eventual successor Ryan Seacrest.[45]\n\nPhilbin was also the host of The Apprentice 2 finale on December 16, 2004,[46] and the official 30-minute red carpet arrivals at the 80th Academy Awards ceremony on February 24, 2008.[47]\n\nPhilbin hosted the 37th Daytime Emmy Awards on June 27, 2010.[48]\n\nGuest appearances [ edit ]\n\nPhilbin made regular guest appearances on Late Show with David Letterman.[49] He was often introduced by Letterman as ""Regis Lee Philbin"", a play on his former morning co-host, Kathie Lee Gifford. He also appeared on other late-night talk shows; such as Jimmy Kimmel Live!, Late Night with Conan O\'Brien, The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson, and Late Night with Jimmy Fallon.[50]\n\nPhilbin appeared on the sitcoms Spin City, How I Met Your Mother, Mad About You, Hope & Faith, Seinfeld, and The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, as well as the sketch-comedy programs The Dana Carvey Show, Mad TV, and The Larry Sanders Show. He appeared in an episode of ""The Big Valley"" called ""The Challenge"" which first aired on March 18, 1968. In 1970, he appeared in an episode of the ABC crime drama The Silent Force.[51]\n\nIn 1991, Philbin was a celebrity guest at WrestleMania VII in Los Angeles, commenting on the main event between Hulk Hogan and Sgt. Slaughter.[52]\n\nIn 1998, Philbin made an appearance in Disney\'s Hercules as the voice of the mythical monster Typhon; Kathie Lee Gifford was also present as the voice of Typhon\'s mate, Echidna.[53]\n\nOn December 25, 2000, Philbin appeared as a panelist on the first season championship game of the ESPN game show 2 Minute Drill.[54]\n\nOn February 28, 2004, Philbin guest-starred in a Lilo & Stitch: The Series episode called ""Drowsy"".[55]\n\nOn May 15, 2006, Philbin appeared as a special guest, alongside Howie Mandel, for a two-hour special episode of Deal or No Deal on NBC.[56]\n\nPhilbin appeared three times on Celebrity Jeopardy!, the most appearances for any competing celebrity on the game show Jeopardy!. In November 2006, he won his competition and earned $50,000 for Cardinal Hayes High School, his alma mater.[57]\n\nPhilbin appeared as a contestant on Celebrity Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader? in November 2007. He again played for his alma mater, Cardinal Hayes High School. He dropped out of the game and went home with $175,000 for the school.[58]\n\nIn September 2008, Philbin guest starred as himself on How I Met Your Mother,[59] where he joined the cast in the search for New York\'s best hamburger. The show revealed that he worked out at Barney\'s gym. During the best-burger hunt, his picture hung in the ""Best Burger"" restaurant and every other suspected best-burger restaurant, such as Corner Bistro and Veggie Heaven. In the show, he hosted a ""show within a show"" called Million Dollar Heads or Tails, which made reference to both Million Dollar Password and Millionaire.\n\nOn December 25, 2009, Philbin attended Christmas Mass with Father Edward L. Beck and Timothy Dolan, the current Archbishop of New York, at The Sunday Mass[60] and gave a special interview discussing how being a Catholic had influenced his life.[61]\n\nIn February 2011, Philbin made an appearance on Take Two with Phineas and Ferb. On July 3, 2011, he was a celebrity guest on The Marriage Ref, along with Tracy Morgan and Susie Essman.[62]\n\nHis appeared as himself in a 2020 episode of the ABC sitcom Single Parents, which was created by his daughter, J.J. Philbin.\n\nAfter Live! [ edit ]\n\nOn May 29, 2012, Philbin appeared on CNN\'s Piers Morgan Tonight during the show\'s Guest Host Week. Philbin\'s guest was his long-time friend, fellow television host David Letterman.[63]\n\nFrom September 2012 to October 2017, Philbin was an official recurring monthly co-host on Rachael Ray.[64]\n\nOn Fox Sports 1, Philbin began co-hosting Crowd Goes Wild, a daily sports panel show, on August 17, 2013. He once again partnered with his producer from Millionaire, Michael Davies.[65][66] In February 2014, he announced his leaving. He returned to occasionally host from March until its cancellation on May 8.\n\nPhilbin guest-hosted two episodes of The Late Late Show in January 2015. That July, he appeared on Today with Kathie Lee and Hoda. He reappeared on the program roughly once a month, and sometimes joined Gifford as a guest host on Hoda Kotb\'s days off.[67]\n\nWriting and singing [ edit ]\n\nPhilbin\'s two autobiographies (with co-author Bill Zehme), I\'m Only One Man! (1995) and Who Wants To Be Me? (2000), are written in the conversational or anecdotal style of his host chats. The first follows a year (1994\xe2\x80\x931995) in his life, his memories of celebrities, and work on Live with Regis and Kathie Lee, among other things. The next was a response to the success of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire. In 2011, upon leaving Live!, HarperCollins released his final memoir, How I Got This Way.[68]\n\nPhilbin was a crooner in the styles of his favorite singers: Dean Martin, Perry Como, and Frank Sinatra.[69] He tested the musical waters with his 1968 pop vocal release, It\'s Time For Regis![70] After receiving poor reviews, he was reluctant to record another studio album, but he occasionally sang on Live, usually duets. In 2004, he recorded When You\'re Smiling, a traditional pop music album.\n\nThe Regis Philbin Christmas Album was released in September 2005 by Hollywood Records.[70] It features several duets, with friend Donald Trump (""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer""), Steve Tyrell (""Marshmallow World""), and wife Joy (""Baby, It\'s Cold Outside"" and ""Winter Wonderland"").[71] A special edition was produced, including tracks sung with the Notre Dame Glee Club.[72][73]\n\nPersonal life [ edit ]\n\nPhilbin and his wife Joy in New York City, 2009\n\nPhilbin was married to Catherine Faylen, the daughter of actor Frank Faylen, from 1955 to 1968; they had a daughter named Amy and a son named Daniel before divorcing. He married interior decorator Joy Senese in 1970; they had two daughters named Joanna and J. J. Senese occasionally co-hosted with Philbin.[citation needed] On Live, he often mentioned Joy, and to a lesser degree his children.[citation needed] He split his time between his Manhattan apartment (near the WABC-TV studios) and Greenwich, Connecticut.[10]\n\nPhilbin followed sports extensively, especially baseball and football.[74] He was an avid fan of the New York Yankees and a proud supporter of the Notre Dame Fighting Irish, the sports teams of his alma mater.[75] He narrated the two audio CDs that accompanied Joe Garner\'s book, Echoes of Notre Dame Football: Great and Memorable Moments of the Fighting Irish, and was unwilling to waver even when St. John\'s basketball coach Steve Lavin asked Regis to trade his allegiance.[76] After graduating from Notre Dame in 1953, he returned to campus often for football games, concerts, pep rallies, banquets, and other events, and donated $2.75 million to the university to build the Philbin Studio Theatre for performance arts productions. When he heard that Larry King had never visited Notre Dame Stadium, he invited King and insisted on giving him a tour of the ""greatest college campus in the world"", which he did in October 2002 with Tim Russert also in attendance.[77]\n\nPhilbin played on the Notre Dame tennis team, casting doubt on claims he made in an ad that he had learned to play tennis from Senese. Notre Dame football coaches such as Charlie Weis, Tyrone Willingham, and Lou Holtz have appeared on Live. Along with being a Yankees fan, Philbin was also ""keeping an eye on the Florida Marlins"".[78] On May 5, 2009, he delivered the first pitch at a Marlins game. He also supported the Pittsburgh Pirates in his final years.[79]\n\nIn March 1984, Philbin opened a Ford dealership in Gilbert, Arizona, as a side investment during his career in television. The dealership, Philbin Ford, suffered due to the already saturated auto market in the area, and was closed in late 1988.[80]\n\nPhilbin was known to have trouble handling new technology, and was frequently confused when operating electronics such as remote controls and DVD players. He did not usually use computers (although he did use one for an episode of Live in 2008, demonstrating how to find homes online) and did not own a cell phone until September 2008. It is often noted, however, that he did not completely reject technology; he simply had Senese make calls and send emails for him.[81]\n\nHealth and death [ edit ]\n\nPhilbin had an angioplasty in 1993.[82][83] On March 14, 2007, he underwent triple bypass surgery at Weill Cornell Medical Center because of plaque in his arteries.[84] Prior to the surgery, Philbin talked with David Letterman, for whom he had substituted on Late Show with David Letterman during Letterman\'s own quintuple bypass surgery.[84] Following Philbin\'s successful heart surgery, he returned to the show on April 26. On December 1, 2009, Philbin had hip replacement surgery.[85][86] He returned to his regular hosting duties on January 4, 2010.[87] In May 2010, he underwent surgery to have a blood clot removed from his calf, and returned to work the next day.[88]\n\nPhilbin died from a heart attack due to coronary artery disease on July 24, 2020,[89][90] a month before his 89th birthday,[91] at a hospital in Greenwich, Connecticut.[92] His funeral was held at the Basilica of the Sacred Heart and he was buried in Cedar Grove Cemetery,[93] both on the campus of his alma mater, the University of Notre Dame.[94][95][96]\n\nPopular culture [ edit ]\n\nActing roles [ edit ]\n\nPhilbin was cast as car salesman Handsome Hal on Kelly Ripa\'s sitcom Hope & Faith.[97] He was chosen as the voice of Mabel, the sister of the Ugly Stepsister (played by Larry King), in Shrek the Third.[98]\n\nWho Wants to Be a Millionaire [ edit ]\n\nDuring the successful first run of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire, Philbin popularized the monochromatic look in men\'s formal wear that emphasizes color rather than pattern in ties and dress shirts. His look was a suit, shirt and tie coordinated in solid, slightly varying shades of the same, usually dark or muted, color.[49] A Van Heusen clothing line based on this look, called Regis, was short-lived.[99]\n\nWhen Philbin hosted Who Wants to Be a Millionaire, he used the phrase ""Is that your final answer?"" whenever he had to confirm a contestant\'s answer. Adopted from the original UK host Chris Tarrant, this became Philbin\'s catch phrase during his tenure with the show.[100]\n\nIn August 2009, Philbin returned for a two-week stint as host of Millionaire. The eleven shows (Sunday-to-Thursday twice, plus one extra Sunday) started airing on August 9 on ABC primetime.\n\nPhilbin (along with Steve Harvey and John Henson) were named the 2009\xe2\x80\x9310 guest hosts of the daily Millionaire. Philbin\'s episodes aired November 30 \xe2\x80\x93 December 4, 2009, and debuted new rules on the show.\n\n2007 Neiman Marcus Christmas Book [ edit ]\n\nIn October 2007, Philbin was featured in the 100th anniversary issue of the Neiman Marcus Christmas Book. He was a host of the Classical Superstars Fantasy Concert, which included piano virtuoso Lola Astanova with Russia\'s Kirov Orchestra led by conductor Valery Gergiev. The super concert for 500 guests was offered for sale at $1.6 million.[101]\n\nAwards and honors [ edit ]\n\nIn Morris Park, Bronx, Cruger Avenue between Sagamore Street and Bronxdale Avenue was co-named Regis Philbin Avenue.[102]\n\nRegis Philbin\'s star at the Hollywood Walk of Fame\n\nLegacy [ edit ]\n\nThe Regis Philbin Studio Theatre in the Marie P.

"b'Can music fans expect an amazing ""Starboy""/""Swish Swish"" mashup sometime soon? Katy Perry and The Weeknd recently had dinner together, according to multiple sources. But since the two singers are both currently single \xe2\x80\x94 with Perry\'s breakup from Orlando Bloom and The Weeknd recently splitting from Selena Gomez \xe2\x80\x94 could this dinner date be a sign of anything more than a friendship or a possible collaboration going on between the two?\n\nSources including Glamour UK and Vogue, reported that the two singers had a fashionable dinner date. According to The Sun\'s report, Perry and The Weeknd, aka Abel Tesfaye, dined together in West Hollywood and apparently had a great time with each other. They then reportedly went home separately. The Sun\'s report suggests that the date between the pair was romantic and not just a dinner between friends, but take that with a grain of salt. Not only are there are no details available from the singers themselves, but other publications are reporting that they simply got dinner, no romance involved.\n\nWhile many sources have reported on this dinner between Perry and The Weeknd, most outlets have yet to report anything regarding a potential relationship between the pair. Sorry to burst the bubble of any Katy Perry and The Weeknd shippers, but it\'s probably just a rumor that the two are dating \xe2\x80\x94 at least right now.\n\nChristopher Polk/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images\n\nThe Weeknd has found himself linked to a couple of different women after his breakup with Gomez, and it\'s not likely that he\'s actually dating every single person he\'e seen with. On Nov. 11, Us Weekly reported that he was seen holding hands with Yovanna Ventura, who was previously linked to Justin Bieber, who is currently dating his ex-girlfriend (and The Weeknd\'s ex-girlfriend, for that matter) Gomez. According to an Us Weekly source, ""[The Weeknd] was trying to make it obvious that he was with someone. They were pretty affectionate and were together the whole night.""\n\nThere were also reports that The Weeknd was back in contact with his ex-girlfriend Bella Hadid. Although they reportedly haven\'t gotten back together romantically, People reported on Nov. 17 that ""He is talking to Bella a lot and they\'ve hung out too."" The Weeknd and Hadid apparently ""still love each other"" and are seeing where things go with them, according to E!. It was also reported by Hollywood Life that he sent Hadid flowers before the Victoria\'s Secret Fashion Show ""with a sweet note"". The abundance of rumors surrounding The Weeknd\'s love life, show that romance rumors might be quick to catch-on whenever he\'s seen hanging out with anyone, as in the case with Perry.\n\nDimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images\n\nRomance rumors surrounding the ""Starboy"" singer have been abundant ever since he and fellow singer Gomez were reported to have broken up. According to E!, the two singers dated for 10 months before they called it quits in late October. The split was reportedly amicable and it had nothing to do with Gomez hanging out with her ex. A source said, ""The relationship was basically over before Justin Bieber and Selena hung out."" It wasn\'t long after those two lovebirds\' reunion hit the headlines. But, since it doesn\'t sound as though there wasn\'t any bad blood with that breakup, it\'s likely that The Weeknd is just focusing on doing his own thing.\n\nDoes his own thing involve Katy Perry? Probably not in a romantic way. Until the two singers confirm anything about a potential relationship, it\'s more likely that they are just two friends hanging out and possibly making some fans\' pop dreams come true.'"

"b'Not to be confused with Pretty Lady (disambiguation)\n\n1990 romantic movie directed by Garry Marshall\n\nPretty Woman is a 1990 American romantic comedy film directed by Garry Marshall, from a screenplay by J. F. Lawton. The film stars Richard Gere and Julia Roberts, and features H\xc3\xa9ctor Elizondo, Ralph Bellamy (in his final performance), Laura San Giacomo, and Jason Alexander in supporting roles.[1] The film\'s story centers on down-on-her-luck Hollywood prostitute Vivian Ward, who is hired by Edward Lewis, a wealthy businessman, to be his escort for several business and social functions, and their developing relationship over the course of her week-long stay with him. The film\'s title Pretty Woman is based on ""Oh, Pretty Woman"", written and sung by Roy Orbison. It is the first film on-screen collaboration between Gere and Roberts; their second film, Runaway Bride, was released in 1999.\n\nOriginally intended to be a dark cautionary tale about class and prostitution in Los Angeles, the film was re-conceived as a romantic comedy with a large budget. It was widely successful at the box office and was the third-highest-grossing film of 1990. The film saw the highest number of ticket sales in the US ever for a romantic comedy,[2] with Box Office Mojo listing it as the number-one romantic comedy by the highest estimated domestic tickets sold at 42,176,400, slightly ahead of My Big Fat Greek Wedding (2002) at 41,419,500 tickets.[3] The film received mixed reviews, though Roberts received a Golden Globe Award and a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance. In addition, screenwriter J. F. Lawton was nominated for a Writers Guild Award and a BAFTA Award.\n\nPlot [ edit ]\n\nEdward Lewis, a high-powered corporate raider from New York, buys and dismantles struggling companies, selling off the assets for profit. He wants his girlfriend to accompany him during a business trip, but fed up with being his ""beck and call girl,"" she ends their relationship. Leaving a business party in the Hollywood Hills, Edward takes his lawyer\'s Lotus Esprit sports car and accidentally ends up on Hollywood Boulevard in the city\'s red-light district. There he encounters prostitute Vivian Ward. As he is having difficulties driving a manual transmission car, he pays Vivian to drive him to the Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel. Edward then hires her for the night. The next day, he asks Vivian to play his girlfriend, offering $3,000 for six days and a new wardrobe. Prior to an important business dinner, Barney, the hotel\'s manager, tutors Vivian in proper etiquette and arranges for her to buy a cocktail dress after several snooty shop clerks had refused to wait on her. Edward is impressed by Vivian\'s transformation and opens up to her, revealing details about his personal and business life.\n\nAt a polo match, Edward\'s attorney, Phillip, suspects Vivian is a corporate spy until Edward reveals how they met. Phillip later propositions Vivian for her services after Edward is finished with her. Vivian is hurt and furious at Edward for exposing her. Edward apologizes and realizes Vivian\'s straightforward personality is rubbing off on him. Edward takes Vivian by private jet to see La Traviata at the San Francisco Opera. The story of the prostitute who falls in love with a rich man moves Vivian. She breaks her ""no kissing"" rule while having sex with Edward. After, mistakenly believing Edward is asleep, Vivian admits she loves him. Edward later offers to help get her off the streets, but she declines, saying that is not her childhood ""fairy tale"" ending of being rescued by a Knight on a white steed.\n\nEdward meets with a shipbuilding tycoon, but rather than dismantling the company, he instead proposes they work together to save it. Phillip, furious that Edward\'s new direction means making less money, goes to the hotel to confront him but finds only Vivian. Blaming her for Edward\'s changing character, he attempts to rape her. Edward arrives and punches Phillip, then fires him.\n\nWith his business in L.A. complete, Edward asks Vivian to stay with him one more night, but only because she wants to, not because he will pay. She refuses and leaves. Edward re-thinks his life, and while being driven to the airport, he has the chauffeur detour to Vivian\'s apartment building. He climbs out through the white limousine\'s sun roof and ascends the fire escape to where Vivian is waiting, overcoming his fear of heights and metaphorically giving Vivian her fairy tale dream she spoke about earlier.\n\nCast [ edit ]\n\nCast notes:\n\nPretty Woman was Hank Azaria\'s first film speaking role. He later co-starred with Julia Roberts again in 2001\'s America\'s Sweethearts .\n\nwas Hank Azaria\'s first film speaking role. He later co-starred with Julia Roberts again in 2001\'s . Gere, Roberts and Elizondo would later co-star again in 1999\'s Runaway Bride.\n\nProduction [ edit ]\n\nDevelopment [ edit ]\n\nThe film was initially conceived as a dark drama about prostitution in Los Angeles in the 1980s.[4] The relationship between Vivian and Edward also originally involved controversial themes, including Vivian being addicted to drugs; part of the deal was that she had to stay off cocaine for a week. Edward eventually throws her out of his car and drives off. The original script by J.F. Lawton, called 3000,[5] ended with Vivian and her prostitute friend on the bus to Disneyland.[4] Producer Laura Ziskin considered these elements detrimental to a sympathetic portrayal of Vivian, and they were removed or assigned to Kit. The deleted scenes have been found, and some were included on the DVD released for the film\'s 15th anniversary.[4] In one, Vivian tells Edward, ""I could just pop ya good and be on my way"", indicating her lack of interest in ""pillow talk"". In another, she is confronted by a drug dealer, Carlos, then rescued by Edward when the limo driver Darryl gets his gun out.\n\nThough inspired by such films as Wall Street and The Last Detail,[5] the film bears a resemblance to Pygmalion myths: particularly George Bernard Shaw\'s play of the same name, which also formed the basis for the Broadway musical My Fair Lady. It was Walt Disney Studios then-president Jeffrey Katzenberg who insisted the film be re-written as a modern-day fairy tale and love story, as opposed to the original dark drama. It was pitched to Touchstone Pictures and re-written as a romantic comedy.[6] The title 3000 was changed because Disney executives thought it sounded like a title for a science fiction film.[7]\n\nThe film is one of two movies that triggered a resurgence of romantic comedy in Hollywood, the other being When Harry Met Sally.... Following this film\'s success, Roberts became the romantic comedy queen of the 1990s.\n\nCasting [ edit ]\n\nCasting of the film was a rather lengthy process. Marshall had initially considered Christopher Reeve, Daniel Day-Lewis, Kevin Kline, and Denzel Washington for the role of Edward, and Al Pacino and Burt Reynolds turned it down.[8] Pacino went as far as doing a casting reading with Roberts before rejecting the part.[9] Gere initially refused but when he met with Roberts, she persuaded him and he eventually agreed to play Lewis.[10] He reportedly started off much more active in his role; but Garry Marshall took him aside and said ""No, no, no, Richard. In this movie, one of you moves and one of you does not. Guess which one you are?""[11] Julia Roberts was not the first choice for the role of Vivian, and was not wanted by Disney. Many other actresses were considered. Marshall originally envisioned Karen Allen for the role; when she declined, auditions went to many better-known actresses of the time including Molly Ringwald,[12] who turned it down because she felt uncomfortable playing a prostitute.[citation needed] Winona Ryder auditioned, but was turned down because Marshall felt she was ""too young"". Jennifer Connelly was also dismissed for the same reason.[4] Emily Lloyd turned it down as it conflicted with her shooting for the film Mermaids.[13]\n\nMeg Ryan, who was a top choice of Marshall\'s, turned it down as well. According to a note written by Marshall, Mary Steenburgen was also among the first choices. Diane Lane came very close to being cast (the script was much darker at the time); they had gone as far as costume fittings, but due to scheduling conflicts she could not accept. Michelle Pfeiffer turned the role down, saying she did not like the script\'s ""tone.""[14] Daryl Hannah was also considered, but believed the role was ""degrading to women"".[14] Valeria Golino declined, doubting it would work with her thick Italian accent.[citation needed] And Jennifer Jason Leigh had auditioned.[15] When all the other actresses turned down the role, 21-year-old Julia Roberts, a relative unknown, with only the sleeper hit Mystic Pizza (1988) and the yet-to-be-released Steel Magnolias (1989), for which she was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, to her credit, won the role of Vivian. Her performance made her a star. J.F. Lawton, writer of the original screenplay, has suggested that the film was ultimately given a happy ending because of the chemistry of Gere and Roberts.[5]\n\nVeteran actor Ralph Bellamy, who plays James Morse, appears in his final acting performance before his death in 1991. Jason Alexander, who had also recently been cast for his role as the bumbling George Costanza in Seinfeld, was cast as Philip Stuckey. A VHS copy of Pretty Woman would appear in Seinfeld\'s apartment in later seasons of Seinfeld as a homage to Alexander\'s participation in the film.\n\nFilming [ edit ]\n\nThe film\'s budget was substantial, at $14 million, so producers could shoot in many locations.[4] Most filming took place in Los Angeles, California, specifically in Beverly Hills, and inside soundstages at Walt Disney Studios in Burbank. The escargot restaurant the ""Voltaire"" was shot at the restaurant ""Rex,"" now called ""Cicada"". Scenes set in the Beverly Wilshire Hotel lobby were shot at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles. Filming commenced on July 24, 1989, but was immediately plagued by problems. These included Ferrari and Porsche declining the product placement opportunity for the car Edward drove, neither firm wishing to be associated with prostitutes.[4] Lotus Cars saw the placement value, and supplied a Silver 1989.5 Esprit SE (which was later sold).[16]\n\nShooting was a generally pleasant, easy-going experience, as the budget was broad and the shooting schedule was not tight.[4] While shooting the scene where Vivian is lying down on the floor of Edward\'s penthouse, watching reruns of I Love Lucy, Garry Marshall had to tickle Roberts\' feet (out of camera range) to get her to laugh.[17] The scene in which Gere playfully snaps the lid of a jewelry case on her fingers was improvised, and her surprised laugh was genuine. The red dress Vivian wears to the opera has been listed among the most unforgettable dresses of all time.[18]\n\nDuring the scene in which Roberts sang to a Prince song in the bathtub, slid down and submerged her head under the bubbles; she emerged to find the crew had left except for the cameraman, who captured the moment on film. In the love scene, she was so stressed that a vein became noticeable on her forehead and had to be massaged by Marshall and Gere. She also developed a case of hives, and calamine lotion was used to soothe her skin until filming resumed.[4] The filming was completed on November 30.[19]\n\nReception [ edit ]\n\nBox office [ edit ]\n\nIn its opening weekend, the film was at number one at the box office, grossing $11,280,591 and averaging $8,513 per theater.[20] Despite dropping to number two in its second weekend, it grossed more with $12,471,670.[20] It was number one at the box office for four non-consecutive weeks, and in the Top 10 for 16 weeks.[20] It has grossed $178,406,268 in the United States and $285,000,000 in other countries for a total worldwide gross of $463,406,268.[3] It was also the fourth highest-grossing film of the year in the United States[21] and the third highest-grossing worldwide.[22] The film remains Disney\'s highest-grossing R-rated release ever.[23]\n\nCritical response [ edit ]\n\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes the film holds an approval rating of 62% based on 66 reviews, with an average rating of 5.8/10. The website\'s critical consensus states, ""Pretty Woman may be a yuppie fantasy, but the film\'s slick comedy, soundtrack, and casting can overcome misgivings.""[24] On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating to reviews, the film has a weighted average score of 51 out of 100, based on 18 critics, indicating ""mixed or average reviews.""[25] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of ""A"" on an A+ to F scale.[26]\n\nOwen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a D, saying it ""starts out as a neo-Pygmalion comedy"" and with ""its tough-hooker heroine, it can work as a feminist version of an upscale princess fantasy."" Gleiberman also said it ""pretends to be about how love transcends money,"" but ""is really obsessed with status symbols.""[27] On its twentieth anniversary, Gleiberman wrote another article, saying that while he felt he was right, he would have given it a B today.[28] Carina Chocano of The New York Times said the movie ""wasn\'t a love story, it was a money story. Its logic depended on a disconnect between character and narrative, between image and meaning, between money and value, and that made it not cluelessly traditional but thoroughly postmodern.""[29]\n\nAccolades [ edit ]\n\nAwards\n\nNominations\n\nIt ranks on #21 in AFI\'s 100 Years... 100 Passions.\n\nMusic [ edit ]\n\nThe film is noted for its musical selections. The hugely successful soundtrack features the song ""Oh, Pretty Woman"" by Roy Orbison, which inspired its title. Roxette\'s ""It Must Have Been Love"" reached No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in June 1990. The soundtrack also features ""King of Wishful Thinking"" by Go West, ""Show Me Your Soul"" by Red Hot Chili Peppers, ""No Explanation"" by Peter Cetera, ""Wild Women Do"" by Natalie Cole and ""Fallen"" by Lauren Wood. The soundtrack went on to be certified triple platinum by the RIAA.[30]\n\nThe opera featured in the film is La Traviata, which also served as inspiration for its plot. The highly dramatic aria fragment that is repeated is the end of ""Dammi tu forza!"" (""Give me strength!""), from the opera. Roberts sings the song ""Kiss"" by Prince while she is in the tub and Gere\'s character is on the phone. Background music is composed by James Newton Howard. The piano piece Gere\'s character plays in the hotel lobby was actually composed and performed by him. Entitled ""He Sleeps/Love Theme"", this piano composition is inspired by Bruce Springsteen\'s ""Racing in the Street"".\n\nSoundtrack [ edit ]\n\nPretty Woman Soundtrack album by Various Artists Released March 13, 1990 Recorded 1964, 1988\xe2\x80\x931989 Genre Pop\n\nRock Length 43 : 36 Label EMI Producer Various artists Singles from Pretty Woman\n\nReleased: February 14, 1990\n\nReleased: 1990\n\nReleased: 20 May 1990\n\nProfessional ratings Review scores Source Rating AllMusic link\n\nThe soundtrack was released on March 13, 1990 by EMI.[31][32]\n\nCertifications [ edit ]\n\nMusical adaptation [ edit ]\n\nA stage musical adaptation of the film opened on Broadway on July 20, 2018 in previews, officially on August 16 at the Nederlander Theatre.[42] This follows an out-of-town tryout at the Oriental Theatre in Chicago, which will run from March 13 to April 15, 2018.

"b'Alicia Keys is really in it to win it as a coach on The Voice. After promoting the reality competition on The Tonight Show With Jimmy Fallon last week, the singer appeared on NBC\'s The Today Show Tuesday (Mar. 7) to give morning viewers a taste of her fighting spirit.\n\nWhile sitting down with Today\'s co-anchors Willie Geist and Carson Daly, the singer -- who was appropriately displayed on screen with the headline ""This Girl Is Still On Fire"" -- discussed motherhood, her singing career, and how they have influenced her judging role on The Voice. Both hosts were intrigued by the ""girl crush"" between Keys and her fellow coach, Gwen Stefani, even comparing their connection to the bromance of Blake Shelton and Adam Levine. But perhaps the most notable thing Keys said about her relationship with her fellow female coach is that it\'s even stronger than the one Stefani has with Shelton.'"

"b'\n\n\n\nPublished in the June/July 2013 issue of Esquire.\n\nBrad Pitt won\'t remember you. If you\'ve met him, he\'ll have no idea who you are when he meets you again. Even if you\'ve had what he calls ""a real conversation,"" your face will start fading from his memory as soon as you walk away. He\'ll try to hold on to its outlines, but your features will suffer an inexorable erasure, and the next time he sees you you\'ll be brand-new to him. He used to try tricking those he\'d forgotten into thinking he remembered them, or at least waiting them out for a clue or scrap of context. But then he decided to experiment.\n\n""So many people hate me because they think I\'m disrespecting them,"" he says. ""So I swear to God, I took one year where I just said, This year, I\'m just going to cop to it and say to people, \'Okay, where did we meet?\' But it just got worse. People were more offended. Every now and then, someone will give me context, and I\'ll say, \'Thank you for helping me.\' But I piss more people off. You get this thing, like, \'You\'re being egotistical. You\'re being conceited.\' But it\'s a mystery to me, man. I can\'t grasp a face and yet I come from such a design/aesthetic point of view. I am going to get it tested.""\n\nHe is convinced he has that thing, that condition he read about a few years ago. What\'s it called? Is he pronouncing it right? That\'s it: prosopagnosia. It\'s gotten to the point where he doesn\'t even like going out \xe2\x80\x94 ""that\'s why I stay at home"" \xe2\x80\x94 but he\'s also a public person, the center of crowds. ""You meet so many damned people,"" he says. ""And then you meet \'em again.""\n\n\n\nSee The Exclusive Photos by Max Vadukul From This Story\n\n\n\nAnd so, if you ever meet Brad Pitt, you should know a few things: He\'ll probably forget you. He\'ll probably worry about forgetting you. He\'ll probably worry that you\'ll think he\'s an asshole for forgetting you. And then he\'ll probably do or say something that will inspire you to tell people that you just met Brad Pitt, and he\'s not an asshole at all.\n\n""I like Brad because he\'s not a cock,"" the British director Guy Ritchie says. ""He\'s about as far away from being a cock as you can be. And it\'s quite easy to be a cock in his position. It comes for free. If you\'re famous and you\'re good-looking, you have a license to be a cock. And I\'m not sure if anyone has a bigger license than Brad. The license has \'cock\' written all over it. And yet, he\'s a good guy. That\'s apparent and manifest as soon as you meet him.""\n\nRitchie met Pitt after he made Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels in 1998. Pitt did what he often does after he sees a movie he likes. ""He called me,"" Ritchie says, ""and told me that he wanted to be part of whatever I was doing next."" They made Snatch two years later, with Pitt as a bare-knuckled boxer whose mumble made the lines he spoke incomprehensible. He was funny, as he always is in supporting roles, and he and Ritchie became friends. ""He wasn\'t a cock back then, either. I\'ve never known him to be a cock.""\n\nIn the ensuing years, Pitt and Ritchie each took up with women of global fame and they each had kids, and when Pitt came to London last year to film World War Z, he took his children to play paintball with Ritchie\'s children and impressed Ritchie with ""his small army of rather efficient killers."" Pitt is, in the estimation of Ritchie and indeed everyone who knows him, ""a committed father."" He has also traveled a lot and seen a lot \xe2\x80\x94 ""and those things can prevent cockery."" But let\'s face it: ""Every film ever made is about the temptation into cockery. Because that\'s life. Brad\'s temptations are greater than most people\'s temptations, and for him not to act on those temptations means the challenges are greater. He\'s in it every day. Is he not a cock by design? There has to be some degree of cognizance. A lack of cockery doesn\'t just happen organically.""\n\nIt\'s one of the great creation stories of modern Hollywood. Two credits shy of his journalism degree, with only one paper left to write before he graduated, Brad Pitt left the University of Missouri in his final semester and worked a couple weeks on the loading dock of his father\'s trucking company in Springfield for gas money. Then he got in the Datsun 200SX his father \xe2\x80\x94 ""a big softie"" \xe2\x80\x94 bought him and drove west. He had never been as far west as Colorado. He screamed as he crossed the Colorado state line and then at every state line thereafter, until he ended up in Los Angeles \xe2\x80\x94 ""me and my big old mullet.""\n\nHe was already pretty good at leaving and not looking back, some kind of essential forgetting. Indeed, his only certainty was that he was not really leaving anything behind, because his life wasn\'t back there in Springfield. ""I always knew I was going somewhere \xe2\x80\x94 going out. I just knew. I just knew. I just knew there were a lot more points of view out there. I wanted to see them. I wanted to hear them. I always liked film as a teaching tool \xe2\x80\x94 a way of getting exposed to ideas that had never been presented to me. It just wasn\'t on the list of career options where I grew up. Then it occurred to me, literally two weeks before graduation: If the opportunity isn\'t here, I\'ll go to it. So simple. But it had never occurred to me. I\'ll just go to it.""\n\nHe\'s told this story before, but it\'s worth telling again, if only because it\'s never really ended. He was twenty-two when he left Missouri. He\'s forty-nine now and, though almost as famous for being a family man as he is for being an actor, he still does most of his talking about arrival or about moving on. Today it\'s about arrival: He has just gotten back to L. A. after spending spring break at his home north of Santa Barbara and camping the night before with his partner, Angelina Jolie, along with their children and a few of their friends. He\'s tired \xe2\x80\x94 ""I woke up way too early and way too wet. But it was really fun. Six kids \xe2\x80\x94 six of \'em. Including one of our young ones. Angie as well. It\'s a great thing, a great thing. Then we drove nine kids three hours in an Econovan. The kind you take a crew in, with bench seats. No other vehicle is big enough. There\'s no car we fit in as a family. Everything else holds seven, eight tops. An SUV only holds seven. And we had nine \xe2\x80\x94 our six and three friends. Eleven, including us. It\'s no frills, man. I\'d love to have it all tricked out, shag carpet on all four walls. But we live in a different world. We rent our vehicles. We don\'t want things so identifiable because we don\'t want to get followed. We spend a lot of time trying to evade the paparazzi. It\'s a big annoyance. But everything in life\'s a trade-off....""\n\nPitt has arrived back in town for work, and he is speaking from a low leather chair on the first floor of a building devoted to postproduction on the Paramount lot. He is wearing a long-sleeved black jersey, dad-sized jeans of such stiff and unbroken denim that their creases form a jagged outline, and black motorcycle boots. His hair, surfer-blond at the ends, is pulled into a short ponytail, and his whiskers, gray as an old dog\'s muzzle, cover a face resolutely golden in color and grainy in texture. He\'s wearing large sunglasses. When he takes them off, he reveals eyes that are blue and tired and wary, animated by alternating currents of curiosity and self-regard, and each bracketed by wrinkles that resemble a child\'s drawing of the sun. He has a neck full of gold chains, tokens of his aesthetic alliance to the seventies. He is bigger than you might think, and his ears are smaller, almost decorative. He is slightly pigeon-toed, with a rolling production of a walk suitable to a man who wears spurs. He has imposingly white teeth and a habit of sticking out his lower jaw when contemplating a question that makes him look as though he\'s imitating Brando in The Godfather. He has employed the same makeup artist for twenty-three years, Jean Black, and she applauds him for allowing his face to show its age, on- and off-camera, and indeed for using all the wear and tear as another kind of prop in his performances. ""He\'s not fighting it,"" she says, and yet he is both rueful and amused that one of the things that attracted him to World War Z is that he didn\'t have to work out for it \xe2\x80\x94 that he could play a hero without having to hang a six-pack.\n\nIn obeisance to the dictates of his family, he has not worked in a week. Upstairs, however, on the third floor, a half dozen or so people in the employ of his production company, Plan B, have been laboring to complete World War Z until they\'ve turned pale as mine workers or, more to the point, zombies. World War Z (out June 21) is Brad Pitt\'s ""zombie movie,"" of course \xe2\x80\x94 a movie that he took on to see if he could make a movie that his sons could enjoy, a forthrightly commercial venture he hoped would serve as the foundation of his first commercial franchise. Instead, it turned into a notoriously ""troubled production,"" fraught with reported cost overruns and creative differences. Pitt dismisses the notion that Z has been any more troubled than any other enormously troubled movie. He says that its notoriety came about ""because of me \xe2\x80\x94 there\'s a big bull\'s-eye on my back."" What he does admit is that Z is a ""big, big bet"" for both Plan B and Paramount, ""with a lot of money on the table,"" and that he had a lot to learn about what it takes to make a big commercial movie. ""You gotta be able to make it pop,"" he says. ""You have to keep paying off, keep paying off, and in order to do that you have to be able to set the trap and snap it at the right moment. There are guys who are just great at that, and I didn\'t understand how technically sharp you have to be to pull off some of that stuff.""\n\nPitt selected Marc Forster to direct the movie because he thought Forster would know how to keep building character even when his character is living up to his summertime obligation to kick some undead ass. Pitt wound up spending a lot of time finding people who knew how to keep building tension while Forster was building character and, in Pitt\'s words, ""respected the rhythms"" of action movies. He wound up being ""more hands on"" than he ever thought he would be, until World War Z was as much a Brad Pitt movie as it was a Marc Forster movie and belonged to him in a way no movie ever had. Though its $200 million budget came from disparate and anxious sources, he owned it \xe2\x80\x94 and that turns out to be how he likes making movies and everything else.\n\nHe says he left Missouri because of ""an itch,"" and he says that the itch he felt then still guides him now. But what kind of itch is it, exactly? He makes movies. He makes wines. He makes furniture. He redesigns houses and works with an architectural firm to design apartment buildings and hotels. He\'s assembling whole neighborhoods in areas of abandonment and blight in three American cities and counting. He collects and races motorcycles. He has six kids. He\'s engaged to one of the most beautiful and famous and demanding women in the world. Quietly and very slowly, as if trying to remember the words of a childhood prayer, he describes his life this way:\n\n""I have very few friends. I have a handful of close friends and I have my family and I haven\'t known life to be any happier. I\'m making things. I just haven\'t known life to be any happier.""\n\nDavid Fincher has directed Brad Pitt in three movies: in 1995, Seven; in 1999, Fight Club; and in 2008, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. As such, he is privy to Pitt\'s spasms of self-doubt: ""Two weeks before he starts shooting any given project, Brad calls and says, \'I\'ve betrayed you. You have the wrong guy. Here\'s your opportunity to get rid of me now.\' Then he moves on. He\'s not neurotic. He doesn\'t second-guess himself. He just needs to get that out of his system.""\n\nFincher got to know Pitt before he was famous. ""We\'d meet at a diner or a Denny\'s in Hollywood and nobody bothered us. Three weeks into Seven, we needed security. I\'ve been in situations with Brad where we go out for pizza and he has sunglasses on and a beard and a scarf and a baseball cap, and seven minutes later we can\'t go out the door. All that was starting on Seven, and it wasn\'t easy. There\'s a madness that surrounds you. And you\'re trying to navigate the world and to navigate your adult life, and there\'s all these other things vying for your attention.""\n\nBrad Pitt became a movie star before he had been able to make himself an actor. He knew it, and so did Fincher. What surprised Fincher, though, was how he responded. ""In Seven, Brad was very anxious to go in and tear it up. He wasn\'t all that comfortable, and it worked amazingly for what the character of Mills needed to be.""\n\nPitt\'s secret, then, was simple enough: He wasn\'t all that good. But he was already learning how to make his lack of experience and technique his secret weapon. Unlike some of his peers, he hadn\'t been acting since he was a child and had never felt born to perform. He hadn\'t had years of training; indeed, as he says, ""my training is documented on film.""\n\n""Before you are anybody,"" Fincher says, ""it\'s hard to be yourself."" But Pitt had no choice. He had to learn how to be himself in front of the camera, because it wasn\'t easy for him to turn himself into someone else. He had to have a life offscreen if he wanted to make characters come to life onscreen and if, more to the point, he wanted to ask moviegoers to pay for the privilege of watching him. He already had fame, with its unrelenting artifice. Now he had to dive as deeply into it as a man could and find something like reality.\n\nHe does not call himself an actor. On forms, he lists his occupation as self-employed. ""I learned that from Bruce Paltrow,"" he says, referring to the father of his first famous girlfriend. ""I always liked it. It\'s a humble way to describe what we do."" And if a stranger on a plane were to ask what he does for a living, he would say, ""Well, I\'d be very Midwest about it, very Missouri. I\'d say, This and that. I\'d say, I\'m a dad, just like you.""\n\nHis answer shows how hard he tries not to be an asshole and how hard it is for a person as famous as he is not to sound like one. In fact, he hesitates to identify himself as an actor not for reasons of humility. He hesitates to identify himself as an actor because he considers himself primarily an artist, a doer, a maker, a craftsman, a man who felt the first thrill of artifice not onstage but in high school shop class, drawing up plans. He hesitates to identify himself as an actor because he is forthrightly interested in leaving a legacy much larger than the legacy of his performances, which, however meaningful, are simply not as concrete as houses and chairs and wine or as endlessly real as children. He likes the idea of being something more than an actor and he likes the idea of being something less than an actor, and when you tell him that you sometimes don\'t look at him as an actor at all, he says, ""That\'s a great compliment. I appreciate that, as long as...""\n\n""As long as...?""\n\n""Well, some people say that because they see me as a celebrity. And then I\'d go, Aaaaaaghhh...""\n\nHe is, of course, an actor. He is, of course, also a celebrity, which is what allows him to reach for a life beyond acting and what allows him to be occasionally mocked for his efforts. Indeed, his efforts to transcend acting \xe2\x80\x94 to transcend celebrity itself \xe2\x80\x94 are part of what makes him a celebrity in the first place, a member in good standing of the modern celebrity class.\n\nOnce about license, fame is now about virtue; once considered corrupting, it is now seen as civilizing or even ennobling, the charming reprobates of old replaced by enlightened global citizens. Brad Pitt is not the only movie star with a production company, a charitable foundation, or an interest in wine making; he is not the only one who turns up both on the cover of Us Weekly and in the poorest and most remote corners of the world; he is not the only one whose eye is exquisite and whose palate is cultivated; he is not the only one who works only with directors advancing the art of filmmaking and who leaves his most indelible imprints in supporting comic roles; he is not the only one who is fiercely protective of his privacy and devoted to a small coterie of longtime friends; he is not the only celebrity who hates being called a celebrity, as if the word itself puts at risk the very meaning he is so ardently and unironically seeking.\n\nWhat makes him different from some of his peers, however, is not the grandeur of his ambition or the purity of his soul but a variation on what Guy Ritchie contends \xe2\x80\x94 the fact that when you meet him, he seems like a good guy, or, as his friend Catherine Keener puts it, ""a fun hang."" Whether or not he succeeds in his current enterprise of being human on a very large scale matters less than his success at being human on a small one. Take a look at the instantly parodied ad he made for Chanel No. 5. It seems the last word in privileged existential exhibitionism. It seems an indulgence on the part of a man who speaks of fame in terms of responsibility rather than freedom, when, in fact, it\'s his freedom to be whoever he wants to be that makes him captivating. His manager, Cynthia Pett, talks about the ad as an opportunity \xe2\x80\x94 an opportunity to be Chanel\'s first male face, an opportunity to work with a director he admires, Joe Wright. But none of that sticks, because we\'ve heard it before. What sticks, instead, is her straightforward report on what her client said when Chanel came calling with what was reported to have been a $7 million offer:\n\n""It\'s the right moment and it\'s a classic brand and I have six kids to put through college.""\n\nHe was the kind of guy who didn\'t finish anything. You know that guy \xe2\x80\x94 you might be that guy yourself. ""I\'d get so far,"" he says, ""and then want to do something else. I mean, I\'m two credits short of graduating college. Two credits. All I had to do was write a paper. What kind of guy is that? That guy scares me \xe2\x80\x94 the guy who always leaves a little on his plate. For a long time, I thought I did too much damage \xe2\x80\x94 drug damage. I was a bit of a drifter. A guy who felt he grew up in something of a vacuum and wanted to see things, wanted to be inspired. I followed that other thing. I spent years fucking off. But then I got burnt out and felt that I was wasting my opportunity. It was a conscious change. This was about a decade ago. It was an epiphany \xe2\x80\x94 a decision not to squander my opportunities. It was a feeling of get up. Because otherwise, what\'s the point?""\n\nA decade ago he was still married to Jennifer Aniston. He had already changed himself, begun to change himself, when he made Mr. & Mrs. Smith with Angelina Jolie. Jolie, he says, ""didn\'t meet that person"" \xe2\x80\x94 the one who left things undone. ""Now I finish,"" he says. ""It is very important to me to see things through."" In Jolie, he met someone who was wired not only to see things through but also to double down on the opportunities \xe2\x80\x94 for altruism and everything else\xe2\x80\x94that her fame afforded.\n\n""I think Brad was ready to soar when he met Angie,"" says Jean Black, the makeup artist who has worked with him on almost every movie since Cool World in 1990. ""This is not to say anything negative about Jennifer. I was part of that and I know that he and Jen are very good friends and he cared deeply for her. But in Angie he saw a very adventurous person who was grabbing on to life and taking it to its nth degree. It was intriguing because I felt Brad had that in him and wanted to unleash it.""\n\nOut of that also came both his family and his focus. ""I always thought that if I wanted to do a family, I wanted to do it big,"" he says. ""I wanted there to be chaos in the house."" He does not mean instability. He is the product of an intact Bible Belt household; Jolie the product of a broken L. A. one \xe2\x80\x94 and it is as if they\'ve joined forces to produce the family that he remembered and she imagined. They\'ve both turned out to be maximalists in that way, proud of all they\'ve taken on, proud of their sheer numbers, proud of the daily disorder that vindicates their common dream. ""There\'s a constant chatter in our house, whether it\'s giggling or screaming or crying or banging. I love it. I love it. I love it. I hate it when they\'re gone. I hate it. Maybe it\'s nice to be in a hotel room for a day \xe2\x80\x94 \'Oh, nice, I can finally read a paper.\' But then, by the next day, I miss that cacophony, all that life.""\n\nThey have three children by birth, three children by adoption, and together they constitute, in Pitt\'s words, ""one big mess."" It is in keeping with his nature not to distinguish between them. ""There\'s a different quality in being able to love someone who is not yours,"" says Eric Roth, an adoptive father who has been Pitt\'s friend since writing the screenplay for Benjamin Button and who is the godfather of Pitt and Jolie\'s nine-year-old son, Pax. ""Brad has that quality in spades. There is no differentiation between his attention and affection for those kids. They\'re all part of his tribe; they\'re like a moving caravan.""\n\nThe children are famous for traveling with their parents when their parents make movies, and the parents are famous for taking turns making movies so that one of them can be with the children while the other works. The children are homeschooled and travel with their teachers. They have all, by Pitt\'s estimation, been around the world three times. They have all, he says, ""been thrown together,"" which is what has bred, from happenstance, a bond based not on blood but on necessity. ""We suffer from a lack of privacy sometimes, but, on the other hand, we have to stick together. We are a little cut off from the herd, and so we have to look to each other for some kind of familiar experience.""\n\nWe, of course, have no idea what the actual experience of the family formed by Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie might be. We may assume \xe2\x80\x94 because they are, in fact, cut off from the herd, because they are so vulnerable and at the same time so protected, because they have been followed by strangers with cameras and sometimes feel hunted, because Pitt and Jolie are weirdly compounded in the public mind as ""Brangelina,"" because they have sold photos of their biological offspring to the tabloids for millions of dollars and then given the money to charity, because they live in compounds in L. A. and Santa Barbara and a ch\xc3\xa2teau in the South of France \xe2\x80\x94 that the dynamics of their family life might be as exotic as their circumstances. But that\'s why Pitt doesn\'t like being called a celebrity. When he left Missouri two credits short of graduation, his itch wasn\'t for fame \xe2\x80\x94 it was for this, a life so large that it would feel indisputably real. He just had to find fame in order to get it.\n\nHe wakes up before anyone else in the house, without an alarm. The first thing he does: ""I brush my teeth. And then I go and make the coffee."" He wears coveralls around the house and slip-on shoes. He cooks breakfast for his kids. He used to try to read the paper, but now he\'s taken a year off from it. He does that \xe2\x80\x94 devotes himself to yearlong projects and quests. He\'s now learning to paint. He likes to build models with his sons and draw with his daughters. He collects vintage and custom-made furniture and has more motorcycles than he can count. He has bodyguards but not a publicist. He is the rare Hollywood star you wouldn\'t want to fuck with. He didn\'t get on a plane until he was twenty-five. On his first trip to New York City, he squeezed into a subway car overcrowded with high school students and they pelted him with peanut shells. He used to smoke a lot of weed. He really likes pizza. He forgets faces but remembers everything you tell him. He\'s not a cock. He likes to send Catherine Keener e-mails with ideas for band names. When Jean Black sends him long e-mails, he sometimes writes back: ""Huh?"" He likes pranks, and once, on a private plane on the way back from the Toronto Film Festival, he drew a dick and balls on the face of his manager, Cynthia Pett, while she was asleep. With a Sharpie.\n\nHe goes to museums after hours and says, ""It\'s a lovely experience walking around a museum by yourself."" He once told his partner in the furniture business, Frank Pollaro, that he wanted to show him the design for a table, and when Pollaro came by his studio he saw forty different models of the table, all fabricated in wire. He\'s a perfectionist. He designed the hinges on the doors of the house in Los Angeles where he lives with his family. They are supposedly really nice hinges. It\'s supposedly a really nice house, or compound of houses. ""I never wanted to be rich until I met Brad,"" says his friend, director Andrew Dominik. ""Because he knows what to do with it. You go to the homes of most movie stars and they\'re like really, really nice hotel rooms. Brad lives in pieces of art. There\'s a breeze blowing through every window. As soon as you walk through the door, you feel stoned.""\n\nBill and Jane Pitt still live in Springfield. Bill is, in his son\'s description, ""stout. Big hands. Big Popeye forearms kind of guy. He grew up doing. \'You don\'t get someone to fix your car, you fix it yourself\' \xe2\x80\x94 that kind of guy. He had to travel a lot when we were young. He ran that trucking company, worked his way up from nothing. He worked hard to give his family more than he had \xe2\x80\x94 that kind of thinking is very much my dad. But then, at one point, he said, \'I\'m missing their childhoods\' and took another position in the company so he could spend more time with us. A lateral move. It was very much a conscious decision, so maybe that\'s where I get that.""\n\nTwo years ago, Pitt portrayed a man close to the age his father was when Brad was growing up in Terrence Malick\'s The Tree of Life. It is a film known for \xe2\x80\x94 notorious for \xe2\x80\x94 its far-flung metaphysical content, and Pitt\'s portrayal of a man enraged by his stifled promise as an artist and ennobled by his volatile love for his three sons gave it whatever grounding it had. Pitt\'s character is locked in struggle with his sons because he tries to embody something he can\'t articulate, and they hate him most when they inevitably disappoint him. He\'s not a big softie. And although Pitt says that ""my father could be very tough on us in matters of integrity,"" he\'s not supposed to be Bill Pitt, either. ""My father is a guy who calls to complain when people overcharge him for work on his house. He calls it \'the celebrity tax.\' They think he makes what I make.""\n\nJean Black has met Bill Pitt. ""Brad\'s dad is definitely the powerhouse in that family. Jane\'s this wonderful spirit and Bill is a man of few words, but when he talks you\'re like, Uh huh. Conscious or not, Brad\'s performance in Tree of Life was the reincarnation of his dad in that way. And it was really difficult for him because he had to be very tough with those children. They weren\'t actors. They\'d never done anything like that, and so much of the movie was unscripted. Brad had to be mean to them, and that\'s not the way he is with children. He made a point of doing things in between scenes to show how he felt about them.\n\n""But they were terrified of him.""\n\nA few years ago, he made a movie about being a celebrity. It was called The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford. It was based on a novel by Ron Hansen. Andrew Dominik sent the novel to Pitt. Pitt had contacted Dominik after his first movie, Chopper, and told him he wanted to work with him, but they had been looking for the right property. Pitt read Hansen\'s novel in twenty-four hours and said, ""Let\'s do it."" Jesse James was from Missouri. He was famous. Pitt could play a famous guy from Missouri.\n\n""The general thing with Brad,"" Dominik says, ""is that he\'s Brad. He\'s always Brad. If he plays someone who goes shopping at a supermarket, he has to act. Brad doesn\'t go to the supermarket. He\'s not an everyman, and that\'s the reason he\'s a star. You can dream on Brad.""\n\nIn Jesse James, he played someone who ""was kind of tired and kind of a bad guy. Brad could do that. He has a sadness about him as a person, and I\'m not sure where it comes from. And when he uses his skills as an actor, he can make you feel it. Brad\'s a really mysterious guy. I don\'t know what he\'s thinking most of the time. He has a very generous perspective on the world, and I don\'t think it\'s something he\'s acquired because he\'s had good fortune in life. Brad hasn\'t become something from being famous. I think he was always that guy.""\n\nHe was not, however, a guy who spent a lot of time with other people on the set. ""The whole family thing on a movie set \xe2\x80\x94 the bonding \xe2\x80\x94 is something Brad doesn\'t do. He walks away from stuff, and he doesn\'t mourn it. But he\'s not scared, and that\'s unusual in Hollywood. You see, what\'s going on in any movie is that the person with the most power is the star. He\'s the one people worry about. The studios worry about him; the executives worry about him. But a lot of people still want to stay out of sticky political situations, because they want to cover their own ass. Brad won\'t. He\'ll do a lot of heavy lifting, and he\'ll use his muscle to go out and get what you want. He\'ll just go out and do it. I have a different situation. I\'m an unknown entity. People expect to push you around, and unless someone comes to your defense you\'re in for a very unpleasant time. Brad came to my defense even when he disagreed with me.\n\n""So I consider Brad a friend. But I don\'t go to his house and drink his beers and shit. There\'s always a process involved if you want to see Brad.""\n\nHe still remembers the kid who made him not believe in God. ""Grade school. He told me that when you meet the devil, you\'re going to hear three knocks. And then the band would start playing \xe2\x80\x94 \'Tubular Bells,\' from The Exorcist.\n\n""Wigged me out. Because of the belief I was steeped in, the mythology I was living in, I stayed awake for three months waiting for the three knocks. Then one night I heard them. I almost shit my pants. I thought I was done for. But the music didn\'t play. Nothing happened. I still have a little beef about that. I still take issue with that \xe2\x80\x94 the loss of three months.""\n\nHe grew up among believers but was not a believer himself. His brother and his sister still live in Missouri and still believe. They worry about him \xe2\x80\x94 the state of his soul. ""We differ greatly on those beliefs, and yet I can\'t change them and they can\'t change me,"" he says. ""But we\'re family, man. We\'ve always been family. We\'re linked by blood and experience. I\'m sure they\'re saddened by me, and I get frustrated with them. But I love them, and at the end of the day if they need me or if they need anything, I\'m there for them. Family.""\n\nHe is not superstitious. Because he considers religion an organized form of superstition, he considers superstition an individual form of religion \xe2\x80\x94 a weakness of mind writ small. ""If I ever start to feel it, I go the other way,"" he says. ""I walk right under the ladder.""\n\nHe always surprises himself, then, when he prepares to travel apart from his family. ""I get superstitious. I\'ve always been that way. I have to do a couple of things. I have to wear a couple of things. I have to have things with me. I\'m not going to tell you what they are. But I\'ve become that person when I do have to go by myself and leave the family behind. Because anything can happen, right?""\n\nHe plays that person in World War Z. Just as he plays a version of himself as a celebrity in Jesse James, he plays a version of himself as a father in Z \xe2\x80\x94 a man who has to leave his daughters in order to save the world. His daughters make him promise to come back and then to wear two bracelets so that he doesn\'t forget. He got that from life, as he got the song that\'s part of the soundtrack. It\'s an instrumental from Muse, and when he heard it he knew it was what he was looking for, because it sounded like ""Tubular Bells,"" and it scared the shit out of him.\n\nHe doesn\'t scare easily. But World War Z is a compendium of the things that scare him. Having to leave his children. Music that sounds like ""Tubular Bells."" A movie that cost $200 million. And crowds of people he doesn\'t know. Hell, World War Z is about crowds, and so when they were filming, he had to hire a thousand extras, and one hot day in Malta they were all packed in an alley, and he was in the middle of them. They reeked to high heaven, and by God so did he, a man wearing bracelets to help him remember, surrounded by a thousand hungry faces he would immediately forget.\n\nPLUS: THE EXCLUSIVE PHOTOS BY MAX VADUKUL\n\nAND: TOM JUNOD ON THE REAL LIFE OF BRANGELINA.\n\nThis content is created and maintained by a third party, and imported onto this page to help users provide their email addresses.

"b'Nothing was said about rescheduling the show, and fans will be able to get refunds.

"b""Thousands are taking the streets to protest President Donald Trump on Tax Day.\n\nThe so-called Tax March is smaller in scale than the Women\xe2\x80\x99s March that drew an estimated 5+ million protesters worldwide following Trump\xe2\x80\x99s inauguration in January, but still drawing vocal crowds across the country.\n\nThose protesting today are primarily calling for Trump to disclose his tax returns. During his candidacy, Trump promised he would release his taxes after the IRS completed their audit of them. He has not. (Note, Trump\xe2\x80\x99s 2016 taxes will immediately be under audit this year.)\n\nCritics believe that Trump\xe2\x80\x99s tax returns may disclose personal or financial ties that influenced the presidential campaign and/or the current administration. This comes as a Senate Intelligence Committee investigation is underway looking at ties between top Trump aides and Russia.\n\nAs with the Women\xe2\x80\x99s March, some celebrities are protesting via social media.

However, Katie and Joshua have always kept in touch despite other relationships. Surprisingly, she reached out to Joshua following her split from Tom in 2012.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLike any old friend, it was like, \xe2\x80\x98Oh, hi, how are ya?

"b'Not everyone is a fan of Kim Kardashian and/or the books she pretends to write.\n\nJust the other day, some 74-year old got arrested after vandalizing six copies of Kim\'s selfie-based memoir.\n\nBut we have a pretty strong feeling the only damage anyone will do to the tome discussed will be to spray one\'s sticky seed all over its page.\n\nIf you know what we mean.\n\nAccording to one of the funniest Radar Online stories we\'ve read in awhile, Kardashian is considering the release of a nude cookbook.\n\nYes, a nude cookbook. As in, a cookbook that features family recipes AND photos of Kim Kardashian nude.\n\nWe challenge anyone out there to come up with a better idea that a book that will enable readers to feed both their actual appetite and their sexual appetite at the same time.\n\nA video report on Radar claims that ""Kim Kardashian has found a new way to line her pockets, even when she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have any,"" adding by way of explanation:\n\n""The reality tart is pitching publishers on the idea of a cookbook in which she poses nude next to her favorite recipes.""\n\nThis may seem like a far-fetched concept, but ask yourself two things:\n\nWould you buy it? Has Kim ever shown any shyness when it comes to taking off her clothing?\n\nYou don\'t need to tell us the answer to question number-one. We understand if you\'re a bit embarrassed to admit it.\n\nBut the answer to question number-two is revealed below:\n\nBefore you dismiss this idea as pure nonsense, allow us to direct your attention to David Thorpe\'s ""Rude Food.""\n\nIn that cookbook, the late photographer conjures images with subtle juxtapositions of attractive and tastefully nude models, along with an astonishing variety of foodstuffs.\n\nVia Amazon, this allowed him ""to create the ultimate in humerous and safe innuendo.""\n\nAn anonymous insider tells Radar that Kardashian is convinced \xe2\x80\x9cher concept will succeed because she thinks she\xe2\x80\x99s in the best shape of her life after having two children.""\n\nShe does look pretty good at the moment, don\'t you think?\n\nLast week, The National Enquirer also alleged that Kim was considering a naked cookbook, writing that the wife of Kanye West wanted to show the world her ""generous cupcakes.""\n\nBy this, we assume the publication meant her ""very large breasts.""\n\nFor someone who has been out of the spotlight for months, ever since that scary armed robbery in Paris in early October, this would certainly be a way for Kardashian to get the world talking about her once again.\n\nShe could make the talk show rounds.\n\nShe could gain new social media followers.\n\nShe could recapture all the attention lost to sister Kylie Jenner.\n\nWe really don\'t see any drawbacks.\n\nMoreover, come on... would this really be the most ridiculous idea for a book from a member of the Kardashian-Jenner family?\n\nConsidering the following releases, all of which are 100% real, it may actually be the best.'"

Both Cheryl and Liam couldn\'t stop gushing about this new little human in their lives and they are super proud to call themselves parents. However, the former X-Factor judge did reveal that their son doesn\'t have a moniker yet.\n\nSome reports are stating that Liam and Cheryl could be disagreeing on a name which is why one hasn\'t been picked out yet. Of course, this is all speculation and no one really knows why the baby doesn\'t have a name yet except the close family.\n\nBut, we did some digging and actually found old interviews where Liam and Cheryl talk about what they would name their future child. These interviews were done separately and before they even started dating. But, they each had completely different ideas when it came to the name.\n\nCould this be a clue as to what\'s going on with the naming today? While there\'s no clear answer, it\'s interesting to think about.\n\nCheryl told GQ magazine, ""I love kids, I\'m obsessed with babies. I know that\'s what I was put on the earth to do \xe2\x80\x93 to be a mother\xe2\x80\xa6Of course I\'ve thought about baby names a million times. I like Alfie for a little boy.""\n\nHowever, Liam told Hits Radio, ""I like the name Taylor. Taylor\'s pretty neutral for a boy or a girl. That\'s what I\'m going to call my first child if I had children.""\n\nHmmm\xe2\x80\xa6there\'s no telling when or if they will reveal the baby name when they have decided but we have a feeling they will come to an agreement. And we\'re so excited when they do. However, multiple outlets are reporting that this photo could be the last fans see of the child. Apparently, Liam and Cheryl turned down lots of offers to publicly debut their baby and have vowed to keep his privacy and protect him from the public eye.\n\nWhile this seems like something they would do, we\'re hoping they share bits and pieces of the baby. To be honest, we can\'t go through life wondering if he looks more like Liam or more like Cheryl! One thing is for sure, he\'s healthy and that\'s all that really matters. Here\'s to hoping picking out a name isn\'t actually putting stress on Cheryl and Liam\'s relationship.\n\nLove J-14?

If you\xe2\x80\x99re a millennial who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t pay attention to old stuff, that\xe2\x80\x99s the loosey-goosey detective show starring the irresistibly charming Tom Selleck that ran on CBS from 1980-1988 and earned him a Best Actor Emmy.\n\nPeter Lenkov, the redo specialist responsible for updating Hawaii Five-O and MacGyver is the guy in charge. He\xe2\x80\x99s hired Jay Hernandez (The Expanse, Suicide Squad) to play Thomas Magnum, like his predecessor, a former Navy Seal turned private investigator who lives in Hawaii.\n\nSo what does Selleck, now happily playing NYPD commissioner Frank Reagan in Blue Bloods, another long-running series \xe2\x80\x94 it will beat Magnum\xe2\x80\x99s length of service next season \xe2\x80\x94 have to say about the new version? He chose to share his feelings for the first time to TV Guide Magazine and TV Insider.\n\nThe actor says when he was in L.A. (he lives on a ranch north of the city when he\xe2\x80\x99s not shooting Blue Bloods) he was asked to come to CBS\xe2\x80\x99s West Coast HQ for a meeting with Lenkov and David Stapf, the CBS TV Studios president.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCBS is kind of my home network,\xe2\x80\x9d says Selleck. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve done The Young and the Restless and (most of) the Jesse Stone movies as well as Magnum and Blue Bloods with them.\xe2\x80\x9d They told him if he \xe2\x80\x9chad a problem\xe2\x80\x9d with the remake, their relationship was important enough that they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do it. ""Peter was very effusive about the project; he grew up with Magnum and this was his dream,\xe2\x80\x9d he adds.\n\nStapf suggested that he talk to Les Moonves, CBS Corporation\xe2\x80\x99s CEO and Chairman of the Board. According to Selleck, Moonves talked about how, since Universal owned the show, they could \xe2\x80\x9cdo whatever they want with it,\xe2\x80\x9d the actor recalls. \xe2\x80\x9cLes said, \xe2\x80\x98We\xe2\x80\x99d like to control the show We think we can do a better job.\xe2\x80\x99""\n\n""I went home,\xe2\x80\x9d Selleck continues, \xe2\x80\x9cand thought about it for about a day. In the end, I thought, \xe2\x80\x98We couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have a better bow tied around our show. We went off with our final episode as the number one show on all of television. We\xe2\x80\x99re in the Smithsonian for recognizing Vietnam veterans in a positive light, the first show to really do that. And it led to countless other opportunities. I just felt success is so hard to come by in this business, why do I want to root for somebody to fail. I just stepped back, and said, \xe2\x80\x98I won\xe2\x80\x99t get in your way.\'\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe also won\xe2\x80\x99t be involved in any way. \xe2\x80\x9cThey asked and I said, \xe2\x80\x98Absolutely not. I\xe2\x80\x99m busy with Blue Bloods.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d But more than that, he concedes, \xe2\x80\x9cIt will never be what in my fantasy world, I would make it to be.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t expect a fun guest spot either. \xe2\x80\x9cI told them that I won\xe2\x80\x99t do some cameo guest spot to let the audience know I approve.\xe2\x80\x9d He\xe2\x80\x99s aware that could disappoint some fans of his and the shows. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure they\xe2\x80\x99d like it, but I have an obligation to my version. And Peter\xe2\x80\x99s going to do his take on what a Magnum under some similar circumstances should be about.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThis isn\xe2\x80\x99t the first time that Selleck turned down a TV offer concerning the ionic role. In the early \xe2\x80\x9890s, Selleck was working with big fan and best-selling author Tom Clancy \xe2\x80\x94 just off the success of The Hunt for Red October \xe2\x80\x94 on a Magnum movie. \xe2\x80\x9cTom and I worked on a story \xe2\x80\x94 a good story for a movie. The character wasn\xe2\x80\x99t done; when we left him, he went back into the Navy. I thought it was time because I was having success with features. Three Men and a Baby had been the number one movie in the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nUniversal Studio chief Sidney Sheinberg had other ideas, Selleck says. He wanted to use Magnum in a wheel of rotating mysteries. \xe2\x80\x9cI had no interest; they weren\xe2\x80\x99t thinking big enough and they really blew it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nOver the years, Selleck says he heard rumors about other movies and TV ideas. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t speak ill of them, but he \xe2\x80\x9cwasn\xe2\x80\x99t particularly thrilled,"" he admits. ""This seemed okay because it\xe2\x80\x99s probably going to happen sooner or later. Why choose to be offended? This is Peter\xe2\x80\x99s dream, let him run with it. He\xe2\x80\x99s a nice man.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nFor lots more from our chat with Tom Selleck, pick up the June 25 issue of TV Guide Magazine.'"
"b'Advertisement\n\nHugh Hefner\'s wife Crystal Harris will inherit nothing after signing an ironclad prenup before their wedding and was never added to his will, it has been reported\n\nHugh Hefner\'s wife Crystal Harris will inherit nothing due to an ironclad prenup that means she was never added to his will, it has been reported.\n\nThe couple, who shared a 60 year age gap, tied the knot on New Year\'s Eve in 2012 at the Playboy Mansion in Los Angeles.\n\nBefore the nuptials, Harris was said to have signed an \'ironclad\' prenuptial agreement.\n\nA source told US Weekly that while the blonde beauty will be taken care of, she won\'t receive a penny of his fortune.\n\nInstead, his estimated $43million estate, will be divided between his four children, the University of Southern California and a list of charities.\n\nThat number doesn\'t take into account the Playboy Mansion which was sold in 2016 for $100million.\n\nThe $43million figure was first revealed back in 2009 when Hefner divorced his second wife Kimberly Conrad.\n\nAt his peak, the Playboy magnate was worth upwards of $200million, but as the magazine\'s popularity tanked, Hefner lost millions.\n\nBy the time of his death the 91-year-old held 35 percent of the Playboy brand and still completely owned the magazine.\n\nHe had $36million worth of stocks and bonds and $6million in a joint account with an unnamed person.\n\nHis monthly earnings from the magazine only totaled $100,000, with the rest coming from his pension.\n\nHefner\'s body was driven away from his Playboy mansion early Thursday morning to begin the journey to his final resting place next to Marilyn Monroe.\n\nThe Playboy founder died of natural causes at the age of 91 on Wednesday night. Around 6.30am on Thursday, two hearses were seen leaving his Holmby Hills mansion.\n\nPolice lined the side of his driveway as the hearses left the residence to take the icon\'s body to an unknown location. He will eventually be buried in a Los Angeles cemetery next to Monroe - Playboy\'s first-ever cover star - in a plot that Hefner bought in 1992 for $75,000.\n\nHefner\'s second wife, Kimberly Conrad, was also spotted leaving the mansion Thursday morning with their 27-year-old son, Marston. Conrad\'s mother is also pictured in the back seat of the car.\n\nThe couple, who shared a 60 year age gap, tied the knot on New Year\'s Eve in 2012 at the Playboy Mansion in Los Angeles\n\nPlaymate Crystal Harris graces the cover of the July 2011 Playboy magazine as \'Mrs. Crystal Hefner\'\n\nConrad (pictured driving) and Hefner were together for nine years and had two children - 27-year-old Marston (pictured in the front passenger seat) and Cooper.

He will eventually be buried in a Los Angeles cemetery next to Monroe - Playboy\'s first-ever cover star - in a plot that Hefner bought in 1992 for $75,000\n\nOfficials outside the mansion signal are seen signaling for the hearses to continue moving forward as they leave the residence\n\nBefore they eventually tied the knot, Hefner and Harris had one notorious failure to launch.\n\nHarris infamously ran from the altar in June 2011, reportedly because she got cold feet.\n\nThe wedding was called off just five days before hand with over 300 guests set to attend.\n\n\'Last time it turned into a big ordeal and then it all fell apart,\' she said.\n\nShe also publicly shamed Hefner, saying that the she had only been intimate with him once - and very briefly.\n\nShe admitted sex with the octogenarian lasted \'like two seconds\', adding: \'Then I was just over it. I was like, \'Ahhh.\' I was over it.\n\nThe pair reconciled and Hugh recently said that he wanted to stay with Crystal until he dies.\n\nHugh also insisted that he didn\'t care about the 60 year difference between them.\n\n\'The dramatic age difference between difference & Crystal & me really doesn\'t matter,\' he tweeted. \'Whatever time I have left, we want to spend together.\'\n\nWhat made this time around different was the fact that Crystal felt more confident about their relationship and was \'excited\' to tie the knot on New Year\'s Eve.\n\nThe Playmate of the month infamously ran from the altar in June 2011, reportedly because she got cold feet\n\n\'This time around is amazing... I\'m very happy and Hef\'s very happy and we\'re excited,\' she said ahead of the nuptials.\n\nShe had already changed her name on the social networking site to Crystal Hefner.\n\nCrystal is the tycoon\'s third wife. He married Mildred Williams in 1949 before divorcing 10 years later.\n\nIn 1989 he married Playmate Kimberly Conrad and they separated in 1998.\n\nHefner has four children: Christie, David, Marston and Cooper.\n\nBefore the nuptials, Harris was said to have signed an \'ironclad\' prenuptial agreement\n\nA source told US Weekly that while the blonde beauty will be taken care of, she has not been added to his will\n\nDuring an appearance on the Huffington Post Live in 2013, the model, 26, was asked why she decided to marry the 86-year-old, to which she replied for \'more security\'.\n\n\'Well for me it meant more security, knowing that I am the one for him,\' she explained.\n\n\'Like we were talking about, there are always girls in and out and always the feeling of maybe being replaced... And he made sure I didn\'t feel that way anymore and that was what the wedding was all about.\'\n\nCrystal says she fell for Hefner because she finds him fascinating.\n\n\'When I first met him, I had never even met a celebrity in my life before. I was like ""Oh my gosh Hef"" and then we started talking,\' she explained.\n\n\'And I love learning about all the history... Just being more involved in his life and learning about Playboy and all the things he has done to change the world.\'\n\nHefner was born on April 9, 1926 ,in Chicago, Illinois, and went on to become a millionaire after founding the influential men\'s magazine in 1953.\n\nOn Wednesday night the official Playboy Twitter account announced: \'American Icon and Playboy Founder, Hugh M. Hefner passed away today. He was 91. #RIPHef.\'\n\nHefner\'s death was confirmed in a statement from Playboy Enterprises that said he \'passed away today [Wednesday] from natural causes at his home, The Playboy Mansion, surrounded by loved ones\'.\n\nHis son, Cooper Hefner, who is also the chief creative officer of Playboy Enterprises, said: \'My father lived an exceptional and impactful life as a media and cultural pioneer and a leading voice behind some of the most significant social and cultural movements of our time in advocating free speech, civil rights and sexual freedom.\n\nLIFE ACCORDING TO HUGH HEFNER \'It\'s good to be selfish. But not so self-centered that you never listen to other people.\' \'If you let society and your peers define who you are, you\'re the less for it.\' \'Life is too short to be living somebody else\'s dream.\' \'Loneliness doesn\'t have much to do with where you are.\' \'If you don\'t have a sense of humor about life and yourself, then you are old.\' Advertisement\n\n\'He defined a lifestyle and ethos that lie at the heart of the Playboy brand, one of the most recognizable and enduring in history.\n\n\'He will be greatly missed by many, including his wife Crystal, my sister Christie and my brothers David and Marston, and all of us at Playboy Enterprises.\'\n\nOn Wednesday night, as news of Hefner\'s death began to circulate, mourners began to gather at the gates of his Playboy Mansion to pay their last respects.\n\nIn the final years of his life, Hefner - who had begun to suffer back problems - began to fade from view, not wanting to be seen using a walker to move around, or be seen fiddling with his hearing aid.\n\n\'It\'s tough to watch him struggle, but I\'m just happy it\'s physical and not mental,\' Cooper told The Hollywood Reporter in August.\n\nThe only photos of Hefner known to have been taken anywhere in 2017 were three photos shared by him and his younger brother Marston on social media in July and August. They showed the family playing backgammon together, and dining out.\n\n\'He will kill me if I print or if you say anything about him retiring,\' Cooper had previously said, \'But I think he is really enjoying his life as a 90-year-old at the mansion.\'\n\nDespite the two being practically synonymous with each other, Hefner sold the Playboy Mansion for $100 million in 2016, but one of the stipulations was that he could continue living there.\n\nTwinkies tycoon Daren Metropoulos, who bought the famous party house, said after his death: \'Hugh Hefner was a visionary in business, a giant in media and an iconic figure of pop culture whose legacy will leave a lasting impact. I was fortunate to know him as a neighbor and friend and I extend my deepest sympathies to his family.\'\n\nSurrounded by bunnies: Pictured from left Holly Madison, Kendra Wilkinson, Hugh Hefner and Bridget Marquardt - with whom he appeared in reality TV show The Girls Next Door\n\nFirst wives: Hefner is seen left with first wife Mildred Williams.

I\xe2\x80\x99m so honored to have been a part of the Playboy team! You will be greatly missed! Love you Hef!

He was a true original, and he was my friend. Rest well Hef.\'\n\nAnd Heidi Montag, who posed for Playboy in 2009, wrote: \'RIP @hughhefner thank you for making me part of the Playboy family.

He keeps a copy of this cover on the wall of his New York office\n\nThe magazine hit with a splash, selling 50,000 copies of its first issue - which featured Marilyn Monroe on the cover - and went on to have seven million subscribers by its second year.\n\nAs its star rose, so too did Hefner - and he went on to amass a huge personal wealth that peaked at $200 million.\n\nIn 1971, Hefner spent $1.1 million (the equivalent of $6 million today) to buy up what would become known as the Playboy Mansion, a 21,987-square-foot LA building.\n\nWith a waterfall, swimming pool, secluded grotto and even a wine cellar hidden behind a Prohibition-era secret door, the mansion became the place for Hollywood celebrities to be seen at Hefner\'s famous Playboy parties.\n\nHe also became a vocal proponent of equal rights for gay people and black Americans; among those interviewed for Playboy was Malcolm X.\n\nBut as time wore on Playboy began to face stiffer competition, first from softcore pornography magazines such as Penthouse in 1969, then later from harder fare such as Larry Flynt\'s Hustler, which debuted in 1974.\n\nAs Playboy left the 1970s and the competition grew, its sales began to decline.\n\nIt also suffered with the rise of the internet, which made access to nude images - both glamorous and grim - easy for everyone.\n\nIn June 2009 the magazine cut its number of publications per year to just 11, while Hefner sold his English Manor house, located next to the Playboy Mansion, the same year for $18 million - $10 million under the asking price.\n\nThe Playboy Mansion had also begun to reflect Hefner\'s downturn in fortune.\n\nHefner, seen here with some of his famous Playboy Bunnies in an archive photo, died surrounded by his friends and family, a statement said\n\nIn 2006, Hefner\'s ex-girlfriend, Izabella St James, then 31, released a book titled Bunny Tales: Behind Closed Doors at the Playboy Mansion, in which she lamented the state of the one-palatial home.\n\nSt James, who entered the home in 2002 as one of Hefner\'s seven \'girlfriends,\' described \'mismatched, random pieces of furniture... as if someone had gone to a charity shop and bought the basics for each room.\'\n\nShe claimed things got worse when Holly Madison became Hefner\'s \'Girlfriend No. 1\' - meaning that she could move into his room, along with her dogs.\n\n\'They weren\'t house-trained and would just do their business on the bedroom carpet,\' she wrote.\n\n\'Late at night, or in the early hours of the morning - if any of us visited Hef\'s bedroom - we\'d almost always end up standing in dog mess.\n\n\'Everything in the Mansion felt old and stale, and Archie the house dog would regularly relieve himself on the hallway curtains, adding a powerful whiff of urine to the general scent of decay.\'\n\nThe mansion was sold last year for $100 million - half its asking price - to businessman Daren Metropoulos, who had previously bought Hefner\'s neighboring English Manor in 2009. He plans to to turn them into a single property.\n\nCooper Hefner made the decision in 2015 to drop frontal nudity from Playboy in order to pitch it more as a Vanity Fair-style luxury lifestyle magazine.\n\nThe first nudity-free issue was released in March 2016; Hefner reportedly fought the removal of cartoons from the magazine more than the nudity.\n\nHowever, in February 2017 the decision was reversed, and the nudity - along with the jokes sections among other elements dropped in the redesign - was restored.\n\n\'Thanks for being a revolutionary\': Jenny McCarthy remembers Hugh Hefner as stars including Paris Hilton and Kim Kardashian pay tribute to Playboy founder dead at 91 Jenny McCarthy owes her career to Playboy. And on Wednesday as news broke of the death of Hugh Hefner, the actress and TV personality paid tribute to the media mogul as she tweeted a picture of one of her Playboy covers. \'RIP #Hef Thank you for being a revolutionary and changing so many people\'s lives, especially mine,\' McCarthy, 44, wrote. \'I hope I made you proud.\' She first posed for Playboy in 1993 and as subsequently named Playmate Of The Year after which she moved to Los Angeles and launched her career.

My folks are prohibitionists. There was no drinking in my home. No discussion of sex. And I think I saw the hurtful and hypocritical side of that from very early on.\'\n\nHefner loved movies throughout his life, calling them \'my other family.\'\n\nHe screened classic films and new releases at the mansion every week. Every year on his April 9 birthday, he\xe2\x80\x99d run his favorite film, Casablanca and invite guests to dress in the fashions of the 1940s.\n\nHe was a playboy before Playboy, even during his first marriage, when he enjoyed stag films, strip poker and group sex. His bunny obsession began with the figures that decorated a childhood blanket. Years later, a real-life subspecies of rabbit on the endangered species list, in the Florida Keys, would be named for him: Sylvilagus palustris hefneri.\n\nHefner grew up in Chicago, Illinois, in a prohibitionist household with two Methodist parents who he said never showed affection towards one another. He is pictured as a young boy some time in the late 1920s, early 1930s\n\nWhen Hefner was nine, he began publishing a neighborhood newspaper, which he sold for a penny a copy. He spent much of his time writing and drawing cartoons, and in middle school began reading Esquire, a magazine of sex and substance Hefner wanted Playboy to emulate.\n\nHe and Playboy co-founder Eldon Sellers launched their magazine from Hefner\xe2\x80\x99s kitchen in Chicago, although the first issue was undated because Hefner doubted there would be a second. The magazine was supposed to be called Stag Party, until an outdoor magazine named Stag threatened legal action.\n\nHefner recalled that he first reinvented himself in high school in Chicago at 16, when he was rejected by a girl he had a crush on.\n\nHe began referring to himself as Hef instead of Hugh, learned the jitterbug and began drawing a comic book, \'a kind of autobiography that put myself center stage in a life I created for myself,\' he said in a 2006 interview with the AP.\n\nThose comics evolved into a detailed scrapbook that Hefner would keep throughout his life. It spanned more than 2,500 volumes in 2011 \xe2\x80\x94 a Guinness World Record for a personal scrapbook collection.\n\n\'It was probably just a way of creating a world of my own to share with my friends,\xe2\x80\x9d Hefner said, seated amid the archives of his life during a 2011 interview. \'And in retrospect, in thinking about it, it\xe2\x80\x99s not a whole lot diff\n\nIn 1953, Hefner published the first issue of Playboy with Marilyn Monroe featured on its cover (left). By the 1960s, Playboy nightclubs had erupted in Chicago and Hefner was well and truly on his path to revolutionizing the way the country dealt with sex. He is pictured (right) in the same year\n\nAs Playboy\'s popularity grew, so did Hefner\'s and his reputation as a ladies man found its beginnings\n\nHefner divorced his first wife, Mildred Williams, in 1959 after ten years of marriage. They are seen (left) on their 1949 wedding day. By the 1960s, Hefner was on his way to revolutionizing the way the country dealt with sex. He had opened the first of his Playboy nightclubs and was publishing the magazine regularly. Above, he is pictured with \'bunny girl\' hostess Bonnie J. Halpin at the Playboy club in Chicago in 1961\n\nHefner is pictured with Playmates in 1960 (left) and again in 1966 (right). The women became known as \'bunny girls\'\n\nHe did it again in 1960, when he began hosting the TV show, bought a fancy car, started smoking a pipe and bought the first Playboy mansion.\n\nNot long after it was launched, Playboy soon became forbidden fruit for teenagers and a bible for men with time and money, primed for the magazine\xe2\x80\x99s prescribed evenings of dimmed lights, hard drinks, soft jazz, deep thoughts and deeper desires. Within a year, circulation neared 200,000. Within five years, it had topped 1 million.\n\nBy the 1970s, the magazine had more than 7 million readers and had inspired such raunchier imitations as Penthouse and Hustler. Competition and the internet reduced circulation to less than 3 million by the 21st century, and the number of issues published annually was cut from 12 to 11. In 2015, Playboy ceased publishing images of naked women, citing the proliferation of nudity on the internet.\n\nBut Hefner and Playboy remained brand names worldwide.\n\nAsked by The New York Times in 1992 of what he was proudest, Hefner responded: \xe2\x80\x9cThat I changed attitudes toward sex. That nice people can live together now. That I decontaminated the notion of premarital sex. That gives me great satisfaction.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHefner bought the infamous Beverly Hills Playboy Mansion in the 1970s and began throwing his notorious raucous parties. He is pictured outside it in 1975\n\nHefner\'s lifestyle expanded in extravagance along with the company. He is pictured on the Playboy jet in the 70s\n\nBy the 1970s, Playboy had more than 7million readers and had inspired rivals including Penthouse and Hustler. Hefner is seen above in 1977\n\nHefner\'s profile as a global celebrity grew and he was seen more and more with one of his beautiful cover girls on his arm. Above, he is pictured with Shannon Tweed in 1981. By the 70s, Hefner had already married and divorced his first wife and they had two children\n\nHefner ran Playboy from his elaborate mansions, first in Chicago and then in Los Angeles, and became the flamboyant symbol of the lifestyle he espoused.\n\nFor decades he was the pipe-smoking, silk-pajama-wearing center of a constant party with celebrities and Playboy models. By his own account, Hefner had sex with more than a thousand women, including many pictured in his magazine. One of rock n\xe2\x80\x99 roll\xe2\x80\x99s most decadent tours, the Rolling Stones shows of 1972, featured a stop at the Hefner mansion.\n\nThroughout the 1960s, Hefner left Chicago only a few times. In the early 1970s, he bought the second mansion in Los Angeles, flying between his homes on a private DC-9 dubbed \xe2\x80\x9cThe Big Bunny,\xe2\x80\x9d which boasted a giant Playboy bunny emblazoned on the tail.\n\nHe continued to grow his empire throughout the 90s (Pictured in 1994) and watched as it welcomed generation after generation of women\n\nHefner was host of a television show, \xe2\x80\x9cPlayboy After Dark,\xe2\x80\x9d and in 1960 opened a string of clubs around the world where waitresses wore revealing costumes with bunny ears and fluffy white bunny tails.\n\nIn the 21st century, he was back on television in a cable reality show \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cThe Girls Next Door\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 with three live-in girlfriends in the Los Angeles Playboy mansion. Network television briefly embraced Hefner\xe2\x80\x99s empire in 2011 with the NBC drama \xe2\x80\x9cThe Playboy Club,\xe2\x80\x9d which failed to lure viewers and was canceled after three episodes.\n\nCensorship was inevitable, starting in the 1950s, when Hefner successfully sued to prevent the U.S. Postal Service from denying him second-class mailing status. Playboy has been banned in China, India, Saudi Arabia and Ireland, and 7-Eleven stores for years did not sell the magazine. Stores that did offer Playboy made sure to stock it on a higher shelf.\n\nWomen were warned from the first issue: \xe2\x80\x9cIf you\xe2\x80\x99re somebody\xe2\x80\x99s sister, wife, or mother-in-law,\xe2\x80\x9d the magazine declared, \xe2\x80\x9cand picked us up by mistake, please pass us along to the man in your life and get back to Ladies Home Companion.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPlayboy proved a scourge, and a temptation.\n\nDrew Barrymore, Farrah Fawcett and Linda Evans are among those who have posed for the magazine. Several bunnies became celebrities, too, including singer Deborah Harry and model Lauren Hutton, both of whom had fond memories of their time with Playboy.\n\nOther bunnies had traumatic experiences, with several alleging they had been raped by Hefner\xe2\x80\x99s close friend Bill Cosby, who faced dozens of such allegations. Hefner issued a statement in late 2014 he \xe2\x80\x9cwould never tolerate this behavior.\xe2\x80\x9d But two years later, former bunny Chloe Goins sued Cosby and Hefner for sexual battery, gender violence and other charges over an alleged 2008 rape.\n\nOne bunny turned out to be a journalist: Feminist Gloria Steinem got hired in the early 1960s and turned her brief employment into an article for Show magazine that described the clubs as pleasure havens for men only.\n\nThe bunnies, Steinem wrote, tended to be poorly educated, overworked and underpaid. Steinem regarded the magazine and clubs not as erotic, but \'pornographic.\'\n\n\'I think Hefner himself wants to go down in history as a person of sophistication and glamour. But the last person I would want to go down in history as is Hugh Hefner,\' Steinem later said.\n\n\'Women are the major beneficiaries of getting rid of the hypocritical old notions about sex,\'Hefner responded.\n\n\'Now some people are acting as if the sexual revolution was a male plot to get laid. One of the unintended by-products of the women\xe2\x80\x99s movement is the association of the erotic impulse with wanting to hurt somebody.\'\n\nHefner added that he was a strong advocate of First Amendment, civil rights and reproductive rights and that the magazine contained far more than centerfolds.\n\nPlayboy serialized Ray Bradbury\xe2\x80\x99s \'Fahrenheit 451\' and later published fiction by John Updike, Doris Lessing and Vladimir Nabokov. Playboy also specialized in long and candid interviews, from Fidel Castro and Frank Sinatra to Marlon Brando and then-presidential candidate Jimmy Carter, who confided that he had \'committed adultery\' in his heart. John Lennon spoke to Playboy in 1980, not long before he was murdered.\n\nWith the dawn of the millennium came a new wave of women for Hefner. By then in his late 70s, he adopted a more grandfatherly demeanor in silk smoking jackets and carried a pipe with him everywhere. He is pictured with actress Jenny McCarthy in 2001\n\nHefner\'s live-in Playmates Holly Madison, Bridget Marquart and Kendra Wilkinson and their relationship with him became the focal point of a show called The Girls of the Playboy Mansion in the early 2000s\n\nNo signs of slowing down: At his 82nd birthday in 2008 (left), Hefner was presented a cake by a nude Pamela Anderson. He is seen right smooching playmate at a recent party\n\nThe line that people read Playboy for the prose, not the pictures, was only partly a joke.\n\nPlayboy\xe2\x80\x99s clubs also influenced the culture, giving early breaks to such entertainers as George Carlin, Rich Little, Mark Russell, Dick Gregory and Redd Foxx. The last of the clubs closed in 1988, when Hefner deemed them \'passe\' and \'too tame for the times.\'\n\nBy then Hefner had built a $200 million company by expanding Playboy to include international editions of the magazine, casinos, a cable network and a film production company.\n\nBefore he married Crystal Harris when she was 24 in 2012 (above together in 2014), Hefner said he never found his soulmate\n\nIn 2006, he got back into the club business with his Playboy Club at the Palms Casino in Las Vegas. A new enterprise in London followed, along with fresh response from women\xe2\x80\x99s groups, who protested the opening with cries of \'Eff off Hef!\xe2\x80\x99\'\n\nHefner liked to say he was untroubled by criticism, but in 1985 he suffered a mild stroke that he blamed on the book \'The Killing of the Unicorn: Dorothy Stratten 1960-1980,\' by filmmaker Peter Bogdanovich.\n\nStratten was a Playmate killed by her husband, Paul Snider, who then killed himself. Bogdanovich, Stratton\xe2\x80\x99s boyfriend at the time, wrote that Hefner helped bring about her murder and was unable to deal with \'what he and his magazine do to women.\'\n\nAfter the stroke, Hefner handed control of his empire to his feminist daughter, Christie, although he owned 70 percent of Playboy stock and continued to choose every month\xe2\x80\x99s Playmate and cover shot. Christie Hefner continued as CEO until 2009.\n\nHe also stopped using recreational drugs and tried less to always be the life of the party.\n\nHe tearfully noted in a 1992 New York Times interview: \'I\xe2\x80\x99ve spent so much of my life looking for love in all the wrong places.\'\n\nNot surprisingly, Hefner\xe2\x80\x99s marriage life was also a bit of a show. In 1949, he married Mildred Williams, with whom he had two children.\n\nThey divorced in 1958. In July 1989, Hefner married Kimberley Conrad, the 1989 Playmate of the Year, who was then 27. The couple also had two children.\n\nOn the eve of his marriage, Hefner was asked if he would have a bachelor party. \'I\xe2\x80\x99ve had a bachelor party for 30 years,\' he said. \'Why do I need one now?\'\n\nThey separated in 1998 but she continued living next door to the Playboy mansion with their two sons.\n\nThe couple divorced in 2010 and he proposed in 2011 to 24-year-old Crystal Harris, a former Playmate. Harris called off the wedding days before the ceremony, but changed her mind and they married at the end of 2012.\n\nHefner leaves behind four children. Two of them are Cooper Hefner, 26, one of his sons from his second marriage (left with him in 2014) and Christie Hefner, his daughter from his first marriage who is now 64. They are seen (right) in 2003\n\nHefner\'s public appearances diminished in recent years. He is pictured in May 2016 looking noticeably more frail than in earlier photographs with Playmate of the Year Eugena Washington\n\n\'Maybe I should be single,\' he said a few months later. \'But I do know that I need an ongoing romantic relationship.\n\nIn other words, I am essentially a very romantic person, and all I really was looking for, quite frankly, with the notion of marriage was continuity and something to let the girl know that I really cared.\'\n\nHe acknowledged, at age 85, that \'I never really found my soulmate.\'\n\nIn 1974, in a succinct summary of his legacy, he said: \'Well, if we hadn\xe2\x80\x99t had the Wright brothers, there would still be airplanes.\n\n\'If there hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been an Edison, there would still be electric lights. And if there hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been a Hefner, we\xe2\x80\x99d still have sex.\n\n\'But maybe we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be enjoying it as much. So the world would be a little poorer. Come to think of it, so would some of my relatives.\'\n\nThis is believed to be the last picture of Hefner which is in circulation. It was taken on June 16 this year, Fathers\' Day and shared online by his son Cooper. He is pictured with Cooper, 26, and Marston, 27, playing back gammon\n\n\'Hefner did not lead the sexual revolution - he was a pornographer who locked women up\': Feminists lead backlash against Playboy mogul claiming that he treated women like \'consumables\'\n\nFeminists have led the backlash against Playboy mogul Hugh Hefner claiming he treated women like \'consumables.\'\n\nCritics have called the magazine publisher, who has died aged 91 at his infamous $100million Beverly Hills mansion, a \'sleazeball who made millions from the objectification of women.\'\n\nAward-winning film and TV writer Alex von Tunzelmann wrote on Twitter: \'Surely the sexual revolution had far more to do with readily available reliable contraception than porn? And Hefner didn\'t invent porn.\n\nFeminists have led the backlash against Playboy mogul Hugh Hefner claiming he treated women like \'consumables\'\n\n\'Women, in this scenario, are merely consumables: life-support systems for the boobs it is so immensely liberating to look at pictures of.\'\n\nThe writer, who produced the screenplay for the 2017 film Churchill, added: \'Hefner in fact worked with a precisely anti-sexual revolutionary mindset. He reinforced the subjugation of women at every turn.\n\n\'To the point of literally locking them up. Huge metal gates at the Playboy Mansion, 9pm curfew, strict rules.\n\n\'There was nothing revolutionary & certainly nothing feminist about him: he was just into a different style of patriarchy from 1950s puritans.\n\n\'He published a lot of pictures of boobs, and in doing so made a lot of money and got away with some really grotesque behaviour. That\'s all.\'\n\nFeminist writer and Harvard scholar Laurie Penny said: \'Unsure how to feel about Hugh Hefner? Make a donation in his name to the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network.\'\n\nTV writer Alex von Tunzelmann wrote on Twitter: \'Surely the sexual revolution had far more to do with readily available reliable contraception than porn? And Hefner didn\'t invent porn\'\n\nSports writer Lunga Biyela\xe2\x80\x8f added: \' Hugh Hefner was not great. Hugh Hefner was a sleazeball who made millions from the objectification of women. How can anyone celebrate him?\n\nActress Ryan Simpkins wrote: \'Maybe I\'m just ignorant... but was Hugh Hefner not a major misogynist? Ive only heard stories of him mistreating women...\'\n\nIn 1963 leading feminist Gloria Steinem went undercover as a bunny waitress in one of Hefner\'s clubs and wrote an expose about her experience that was published in Show magazine.\n\nIn \xe2\x80\x98A Bunny\'s Tale\xe2\x80\x99 Steinem describes how employees were banned from having relationships and had to undergo examinations for sexual diseases before they could work, which caused public outcry.\n\nWriter Laurie Penny said: \'Unsure how to feel about Hugh Hefner? Make a donation in his name to the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network\'\n\nAnd in a 2011 documentary about his life, Hugh Hefner: Playboy, Activist and Rebel, Hef controversially said: \xe2\x80\x98Women are sex objects. If women weren\xe2\x80\x99t sex objects, there wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be another generation.\xe2\x80\x99\n\nFormer Playboy bunny Holly Madison lifted the lid on what really goes on in the Playboy mansion and the depression she suffered while being married to Hugh Hefner in her book, \'Down the Rabbit Hole: Curious Adventures and Cautionary Tales from a Former Playboy Bunny\'.\n\nShe detailed how, as a 22-year-old college dropout and struggling Hooters waitress, she first met Hefner in 2000 and, after a night out clubbing with his \'girlfriends\', realized that she was expected to sleep with him.\n\nThe posse were out at a club in LA and Madison\'s first encounter with Hefner - now 89 - was him offering her a Quaalude from a tissue in his pocket.\n\n\'Usually I don\'t approve of drugs, but you know, in the \'70s they used to call these pills \'\'thigh openers\'\',\' Hefner told her.\n\n\'I knew when I accepted the invitation to go out with them that I was getting into something racy,\' Madison writes in the book.\n\nIn the limo on the way home, Madison was told by one of Hefner\'s seven girlfriends that after clubbing, the party continues in the bedroom\n\nMadison said Hefner\'s room was dark and cluttered with furniture and video tapes.\n\n\'Ceiling-high piles of videotapes, stuffed animals, art and gifts littered the room. It was like an episode of Hoarders,\' Madison wrote.\n\nThe only light was coming from two massive televisions that were playing porn.\n\nIn 1963 leading feminist Gloria Steinem went undercover as a bunny waitress (pictured) in one of Hefner\'s clubs and wrote an expose about her experience that was published in Show magazine\n\nFormer Playboy bunny Holly Madison lifted the lid on what really goes on in the Playboy mansion and the depression she suffered while being married to Hugh Hefner in her book\n\nShe detailed how, as a 22-year-old college dropout and struggling Hooters waitress, she first met Hefner in 2000 and, after a night out clubbing with his \'girlfriends\', realized that she was expected to sleep with him\n\n\'The girlfriends, in various stages of undress, were sitting in a semicircle at the edge of the bed \xe2\x80\x94 some kneeling, some standing, some lying down,\' she writes.\n\n\'I sat myself on the edge of the bed \xe2\x80\x94 unsure of what to do next\n\nOne of the girl\'s whispered: \'Fake the f---.\'\n\nThe aging house was in various stages of disrepair, and the carpet was permanently stained with urine from Hefner\'s dogs.\n\nThe bedrooms had old, cheap beds and dressers.\n\nThe girlfriends - who had a strict 9pm curfew on nights they didn\'t go clubbing with Hefner - secretly kept boyfriends on the side, and would tape up the air vents in their room so they could smoke meth without anyone knowing.\n\nEvery bathroom had a tray with Vaseline, Johnson\'s Baby Oil and Kleenex.\n\nHefner had an open account at the Jos\xc3\xa9 Eber Salon in Beverly Hills, where the girls could go to get their hair done and have beauty treatments whenever they liked.\n\nHe would also pay for any plastic surgery they wanted, and gave them a $1,000-a-week clothing allowance.\n\n\'Frankly speaking, I\'ve always been pretty uncomfortable with Hef\'s fascination with extremely young women,\' Madison writes in the book.\n\n\'He was obsessed with women looking as young as humanly possible. Everything \xe2\x80\x94 absolutely everything \xe2\x80\x94 about that skeeved me out.\'\n\nPart of the rules of the house was that the girls could not work, and Madison soon became incredible bored, which started a spiral of depression.\n\nOne day, in an effort to do something with her time, she decided to clean up Hefner\'s filthy room.\n\nThe girlfriends - who had a strict 9pm curfew on nights they didn\'t go clubbing with Hefner - secretly kept boyfriends on the side, and would tape up the air vents in their room so they could smoke meth without anyone knowing\n\nAs time went on, Madison became more depressed. \'There were days I woke up and just felt like falling to the floor because I felt so depressed,\' she wrote\n\nHowever in her organizing she came across a video that was labeled \'Girl and Dog\'.\n\n\'My stomach turned,\' Madison said. \'I was like, \'What the hell is this?\'\'\'\n\nAs time went on, Madison became more depressed. \'There were days I woke up and just felt like falling to the floor because I felt so depressed,\' she wrote.\n\nHefner would not let her see a psychiatrist, fearing the doctor would just tell Madison to leave the mansion.\n\nShe ended up seeing one behind his back, and realized that Hefner chose girls that were vulnerable. \'We were all young,\' Madison says. \'He wasn\'t interested in women over 28. None of us were from a big city or affluent backgrounds. None of us had ever seen the darker side of the entertainment industry.\'\n\nMadison also said that Hefner became emotionally abusive toward her. Eventually she left the mansion, starting a relationship with magician Chris Angel.\n\nDuring her depression, Madison thought about ending her own life,according to Us Weekly.\n\n\'Life inside the notorious Mansion wasn\'t a dream at all and quickly became her nightmare,\' the release continued.\n\n\'After losing her identity, her sense of self-worth and her hope for the future, Holly found herself sitting alone in a bathtub contemplating suicide.\'\n\nThe book also reveals the \'oppressive routine of strict rules, manipulation, and [her] battles with ambitious, backstabbing bunnies.\''"

By the time a pal was characterizing their coupling as ""more than just a fling"" in early 2016, Bieber was reaching for the right words to define it as well.\n\nYou see, he\'d learned a bit from his rollercoaster romance with Gomez. He wasn\'t going to recklessly dive into this union, hands in the air. Though he described the Drop the Mic host as ""someone I really love"" in his February 2016 GQ profile, he was careful not to label the connection they shared. ""I don\'t want to put anyone in a position where they feel like I\'m only theirs, only to be hurt in the end,"" he shared. ""Right now in my life, I don\'t want to be held down by anything. I already have a lot that I have to commit to. A lot of responsibilities. I don\'t want to feel like the girl I love is an added responsibility.""\n\nThis wasn\'t about being free to party with groupies, he insisted, but rather a different, and dare we say more mature, way of approaching a relationship. ""I know that in the past I\'ve hurt people and said things that I didn\'t mean to make them happy in the moment,"" he continued. ""So now I\'m just more so looking at the future, making sure I\'m not damaging them. What if Hailey ends up being the girl I\'m gonna marry, right?

"b'Marc Anthony Net Worth: Marc Anthony is an American actor, singer, entrepreneur, and producer who has a net worth of $80 million dollars. He is probably most widely recognized for his music career. Marc is the highest selling salsa artist in history, and to date has sold more than 30 million albums worldwide.\n\nEarly Life and Career Beginnings: Marco Antonio Mu\xc3\xb1iz, better known by his stage name Marc Anthony, was born in New York City on September 16, 1968. His mother, Guillermina, was a housewife, and his father, Felipe, was a hospital cafeteria worker and musician. Both of his parents were from Puerto Rico. Anthony grew up in East Harlem, and was raised Roman Catholic. He is the youngest of eight children.\n\nHe began learning music from his father, who taught him how to sing in both Spanish and English. He is actually named after the Mexican singer Marco Antonio Mu\xc3\xb1iz. He began his musical career as a session vocalist for freestyle music and underground New York house music acts, and then was a songwriter and backing vocalist for the pop acts Menudo, and the Latin Rascals. This is around the time that he began going by the name Marc Anthony, to avoid confusion with his namesake. He gained fame by performing a style of salsa that borrowed more heavily from African American and urban genres he listened to growing up.\n\nMusic Career: Anthony\'s first album, a freestyle music record, ""Rebel"", debuted in 1988 on Bluedog Records. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, he worked on a number of projects. He wrote and produced the song ""Boy I\'ve Been Told"" for Sa-Fire, and wrote a duet with Chrissy I-eece called ""You Should Know By Now"" with Little Louie Vega and Todd Terry. He also featured on several freestyle club hits, including ""Ride On The Rhythm"" and ""Time"".\n\nAfter initially being reluctant to become a salsa musician, he eventually changed his mind and work with RMM Records to release his Spanish-language debut, ""Otra Nota"", in 1993. He followed this up with the album ""Todo a su tiempo"" (1995), which won him a Billboard award for Hot Tropical Artist of the Year, and was nominated for a Grammy. The album has sold more than 800,000 copies, and has been certified Gold in both the United States and in Puerto Rico. He released ""Contra La Coriente"" in 1997. The album\'s song ""Y Huubo Alguien"" was his first No. 1 single on the Billboard Hot Latin Tracks, and was the first song to top the chart by a salsa musician. It also was the first salsa album ever to enter the Billboard 200 chart. He left RMM in 1999, and joined Sony Records.\n\nIn 1999, riding the crossover wave of other Spanish-language artists like Ricky Martin and Enrique Iglesias, Anthony took a shot at the Anglophone market with the English-language album ""Marc Anthony"". It debuted at No. 8 on the Billboard 200, and went Platinum just six weeks later. Eventually, it was certified triple platinum, and the song ""I Need To Know"" was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance. He has since released the albums ""Libre"" (2001), ""Mended"" (2002), ""Amar Sin Mentiras"" (2004), ""Valio la Pena"" (2004), ""El Cantante"" (2007), ""Iconos"" (2010), ""3.0"" (2013), and ""Opus"" (2019).\n\nActing: Anthony first ventured into acting with supporting roles in films like ""Hackers"" (1995), ""Big Night"" (1996) and ""The Substitute"" (1996). He then appeared in the 1998 stage musical ""The Capeman"" with Ruben Blades and Ednita Nazario. The stage show ran for a total of 68 performances. We went on to appear in the films ""Brining Out the Dead"" (1999), ""In the Time of the Butterflies"" (2001), ""Man On Fire"" (2004), ""El Cantante"" (2007). He also appeared as a guest-star in two 2010 episodes of the TNT medical drama ""HawthoRNe"" as the love interest of Jada Pinkett Smith\'s character, and was later named the executive music producer of the show. Later, in 2011, Anthony ventured into the realm of reality television with the Latin talet series ""Q\'Viva! The Chosen"". It was created by Simon Fuller, and featured Anthony and then-wife Jennifer Lopez travelling across 21 countries to find new talent. Then, in 2012, Anthony was a guest mentor on Season 2 of ""The X Factor"".\n\nOther Ventures: Anthony launched the Maestro Cares Foundation in 2012 in partnership with entrepreneur Henry C\xc3\xa1rdenas. Some of the work the foundation has been involved in includes the opening of an orphanage in La Romana, Dominican Republic, in 2014, and opening a youth home and school in Barranquilla, Colombia, in 2015. In 2009, Anthony became a minority owner of the Miami Dolphins. In April 2015, he announced the formation of the entertainment company Magnus Media.\n\nPersonal Life: Anthony dated Debbie Rosado, and together they had a daughter in 1994. They also adopted a son together. From 1996 to 1998, Anthony dated and became engaged to actress Claudette Lali. After they split, Anthony married former Miss Universe Dayanara Torres in 2000. Together, they have two sons. After a briefly separating and reconciling in 2002, the couple divorced in January 2004.\n\nIn June 2004, Anthony married singer Jennifer Lopez, and she gave birth to their twins Emme and Maximillian in February 2008. Anthony and Lopez separated in 2011, and finalized their divorce in June 2014. In November 2014, Anthony married model Shannon de Lima in the Dominican Republic. They separated in November 2016, and finalized their divorce in 2017.\n\nIn July 2018, Anthony purchased a $19 million mansion in Florida. He also owns a multi-million dollar property in Tarzana, California.'"

"b""Despite being just 20 years old, Kylie Jenner has been the subject of much speculation about whether or not she\xe2\x80\x99s had plastic surgery. At last count, it\xe2\x80\x99s been five years since the world became obsessed with Kylie\xe2\x80\x99s lips. Some of her fans even tried using a lip-enhancing tool to get a Jenner-sized pout. (Spoiler: the #KylieJennerLipChallenge did not end well.) For a long time, the Keeping Up With The Kardashians star denied getting injections, instead claiming that she had been over lining her lips. However, she recently came clean about the lip fillers, explaining that she\xe2\x80\x99s been having them done for five years. This got us thinking: What else has Kylie had done that she hasn\xe2\x80\x99t told us about? Here, plastic surgeon Dr Andrea Giannitrapani from MYA gives his professional opinion on the procedures Kylie Jenner miiiight have had done.\n\nLips\n\nSo, Kylie\xe2\x80\x99s lips are no longer a mystery: She\xe2\x80\x99s definitely had them done. On a recent episode of Life of Kylie, she opened up about why she got them done:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was 15 and I was insecure about my lips. I have really small lips. And it was like one of my first kisses and a guy was like, \xe2\x80\x98I didn\xe2\x80\x99t think you would be a good kisser because you have such small lips.\xe2\x80\x99 I took that really hard. When a guy you like says that, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, it just really affected me. I just didn\xe2\x80\x99t feel desirable or pretty. \xe2\x80\x9cI would overline my lips with the lip liner to create the illusion of bigger lips and then, finally, I was like, this lip liner isn't doing it and ended up getting my lips done.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBreasts\n\nIn 2015, Kylie posted on her app, telling her fans that the secret to her new, bigger boobs was a Victoria\xe2\x80\x99s Secret bra. \xe2\x80\x9cEveryone thinks I\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten a breast augmentation recently and I haven\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d She adds, \xe2\x80\x9cI just use the \xe2\x80\x98Bombsh ell\xe2\x80\x99 by Victoria\xe2\x80\x99s Secret \xe2\x80\x93 it\xe2\x80\x99s life-changing.

This is Nixon/Watergate. Bad (or sick) guy! \xe2\x80\x94 Donald J.

So if under the Obama administration they were simply monitoring contacts with Russian officials \xe2\x80\x93 not trying to wiretap into the Trump campaign but simply looking at who Russian officials were talking with \xe2\x80\x93 and then Trump campaign officials got ensnared in that net, then it\xe2\x80\x99s a total mischaracterisation to say President Obama was wiretapping Trump.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRep Eric Swalwell, a Democrat who is a member of the House intelligence committee, told Fox News that Trump \xe2\x80\x9cis not credible when it comes to talking about Russia\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\nSwalwell downplayed Trump\xe2\x80\x99s allegations. \xe2\x80\x9cI think this is just the president up early doing his routine tweeting, he said. \xe2\x80\x9cPresidents don\xe2\x80\x99t wiretap anyone.
