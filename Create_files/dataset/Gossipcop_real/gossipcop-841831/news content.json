Brie is currently 37 weeks pregnant and Nikki said pregnancy has been great for her.\n\n\"She's in the stage where she is getting a bit uncomfortable and can't wait to have the baby. But she looks so beautiful pregnant, she has this amazing glow,\" said Nikki.\n\nShe also added that her twin sister looks like she is due any minute and that she is excited to be an aunt.
