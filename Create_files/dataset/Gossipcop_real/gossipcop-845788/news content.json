The men are the gangsters, but us, the molls, we use our wiles, our cunning, a hand on an elbow, a whisper in an ear, to manage things from behind the scenes. \u201d \u2014 Hermione to Veronica[src]\n\n\n\nHermione Apollonia Lodge (n\u00e9e Gomez) was initially a main character on The CW's Riverdale. She has since been demoted to recurring for the fifth season onward.[2] She is portrayed by Marisol Nichols.\n\nHermione is the ex-wife of Hiram Lodge and the mother of Veronica Lodge. She had a brief affair with Fred Andrews, but, their relationship ended when Hermione revealed that she was the buyer of the SoDale project.\n\nDuring her husband's incarceration, Hermione and their daughter were forced to leave New York and move back to her hometown Riverdale, during which time she attempted to turn Lodge Industries, their family business, into a legitimate company. However, upon Hiram's release, he regained control of the company. Since then, in an effort to assist Hiram in over seeing his master plan to monopolize Riverdale, Hermione has become Mayor of Riverdale. However, as things progressed, Hermione and Hiram no longer shared the same goals and she tried to have him killed twice. Unfortunately, she failed, and this resulted in their separation and subsequent marriage annulment. She was then taken into custody for attempted murder, during which time she was removed as mayor.\n\nCharacter Description\n\nHermione has now returned to Riverdale, eager to start afresh with her daughter following the scandalous incarceration of her husband.[3]\n\nEarly Life\n\nHermione grew up in Riverdale, her mother was a maid who worked at the Five Seasons and during that time, Hermione would go on to date Fred Andrews. Throughout her high school years, Hermione worked at local businesses such as the Bijou and Spiffany's.[1] During her youth, some would have described Hermione as a mean girl. She even believes her current misfortune was karma finally catching up to her. After she broke up with Fred, she married Hiram Lodge and the two moved to New York City. Together they had a daughter, Veronica. After Hiram was arrested for fraud and embezzlement, Hermione and Veronica left New York City and moved back to Riverdale. After the scandal, the only remaining property that was not seized because it was in Hermione's name was the luxurious apartment building, the Pembrooke, where she currently resides with her daughter.\n\nThroughout Riverdale\n\nPhysical Appearance\n\nHermione Lodge is a gorgeous middle-aged woman who possesses a sun-kissed complexion, calculating brown eyes, and luxuriant thick, wavy black hair. She is of average height, approximating 5'4\" with a narrow and attractive build. She wears elegant, stylish and expensive looking clothes, in a minimalist style which allows her to perfectly embody the look of a chic, well put together business woman.\n\nFormerly she wore the standard Pop's Chock'lit Shoppe employee uniform, before Fred Andrews hired her at Andrews Construction as his bookkeeper.\n\nPersonality\n\nHermione is a strong and confident, independent woman. She's also fairly intelligent, furthering along her plan to turn Lodge Industries into a legitimate business, leaving the Blossoms to wonder if they should have gotten her arrested instead of Hiram. While Hermione is a loving and caring mother, willing to do anything for Veronica, she's not so faithful as a wife. During Hiram's incarceration, she was having a secret love affair with Fred Andrews, up until he broke it off. Hermione also has hopes to regain that luxurious and expensive lifestyle that her family once lived, the lifestyle that she loved so much and had grown accustomed to.\n\nHermione is also very manipulative, while also being dishonest in order to accomplish the goal ahead of her. She lied about writing the blackmail letter threatening herself, claiming that it came from her when in fact it actually came from Hiram. She appears to be in league with him, sharing the same goals and ruthlessness when it comes to business. However, it becomes apparent that Hermione is only in league with herself, appointing FP as Sheriff and hiring him to kill Hiram only to later frame FP for the shooting.\n\nRelationships\n\nMain article: Hermione and Veronica\n\n\u201c You're playing with fire, I want you to know. \u201d \u2014 Hermione to Veronica about Hiram[src]\n\n\n\n\n\nThe relationship between Hermione and Veronica Lodge, so far, has been quite strong, they have shown to deeply care about each other, even though they have been known to fight on occasions.

However, she is more interested in securing herself, as well as her relationship with Hiram, after he was recently released from prison and returned to Riverdale.\n\n\n\nPenelope and Hermione grew up in Riverdale together. They've been rivals since the two of them were students at Riverdale High School, and that rivalry continues on to this very day. The two rarely cross paths with each other, but when they do, it's hardly ever a pleasant exchange. They are also part of two of the wealthiest families in Riverdale. Their families have also had a past business deal with each other, up until Hiram Lodge's arrest.\n\n\n\nHermione and Alice's relationship dates back to their adolescents, with both of them growing up in Riverdale. The two were rivals while students at Riverdale High School. A rivalry that proved lasting once Hermione moved back into town with her daughter, Veronica Lodge, after many years of living in New York. Even though the two ladies may have there differences, with Alice being judgmental towards others, Hermione was more than willing to put their differences aside, when she invited Alice to accompany her at Pop's Chock'lit Shoppe, while she discussed Polly's Baby shower.\n\n\n\nHermione was possibly friends with Mary Andrews when they were friends in high school. The history between the two of them is remains unknown at the moment, but Mary's willingness to invite Hermione to accompany her and Fred at the Homecoming suggest some form of peaceful coexistence.\n\n\n\nAppearances\n\nGallery\n\nHermione Lodge's Gallery Can Be Found Here .
