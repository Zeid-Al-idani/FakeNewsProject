He even wrote the word \u201cflawless\u201d across one of the photos of himself!\n\nMUST SEE: Check out the Cast of \u2018Meet the Parents\u2019 Then and Now!\n\nThough it\u2019s unclear whether or not the Goodfellas star will make an account on his phone, we\u2019d really love to get an inside look at the iconic star\u2019s life offscreen!\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Robert has dabbled with social media. Earlier this year, he hilariously read mean tweets on an episode of Jimmy Kimmel Live. Turns out, he wasn\u2019t really happy with the criticism from the rolls on the platform, as he fired back at every single one with an insulting response.\n\nMUST SEE: \u2018Taxi Driver\u2019 Cast Reunites for The Film\u2019s 40th Anniversary!\n\nNow it makes sense why Robert keeps so private and doesn\u2019t have any personal social media accounts! We\u2019re still hoping that changes one day, though.\n\nClick through the gallery below to see the cast of Robert\u2019s hit film Meet the Fockers then and now!", "images": ["https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/shutterstock_editorial_10543684k.jpg?crop=518px%2C193px%2C2424px%2C2424px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Lisa-Marie-out-and-about-.jpg?crop=0px%2C95px%2C1657px%2C1657px&resize=90%2C90", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAUEBAAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/reba-mcentire-beach-vacation02.jpg?crop=330px%2C337px%2C1005px%2C1004px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ben-stiller-meet-the-fockers.jpg?fit=200%2C200", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/robert-de-niro-snapchat.jpg?w=750&h=600&crop=1&resize=1000%2C893", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Ree-Drummond.jpg?crop=0px%2C447px%2C2346px%2C1329px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/LTG_HOL_AMI_11.24.20_300x490.jpg?fit=300%2C490", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/goldie-hawn-recalls-the-special-way-kurt-russell-looked-at-her-kids-when-they-started-dating.jpg?crop=0px%2C349px%2C2336px%2C2336px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/marlene-dietrich-1948.jpg?crop=0px%2C257px%2C2509px%2C1423px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Melissa-Rivers-Reflects-on-Mom-Joans-Legacy-After-Her-Death.jpg?crop=0px%2C59px%2C3000px%2C1699px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/goldie-hawns-cutest-photos-with-kids-kate-oliver-wyatt-and-boston-2014.jpg?crop=0px%2C41px%2C2220px%2C1258px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/CL4420_cover_final.jpg?w=300", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Henry-Winkler-with-son-feature.jpg?crop=0px%2C102px%2C2626px%2C2626px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/joyce-bulifant-mary-tyler-moore-actress-life-career.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Joan-Lunden-Is-Appreciative-After-Beating-Breast-Cancer.jpg?crop=0px%2C169px%2C3494px%2C1978px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linda-ronstadt-health-update.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/dave-coulier-talks-full-house-wife-melissa-and-future-work02.jpg?crop=281px%2C113px%2C2015px%2C1140px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/robert-deniro-meet-the-fockers.jpg?resize=1000%2C630", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/robert-deniro-meet-the-fockers.jpg?fit=200%2C200", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Geena-Davis-Feels-Better-at-64-\u2014-There-Are-No-Limits.jpg?crop=0px%2C88px%2C3000px%2C1699px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/martin-lawrence-kids.jpg?crop=741px%2C0px%2C2204px%2C2204px&resize=90%2C90"], "top_img": "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/robert-deniro-meet-the-fockers.jpg?resize=1000%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Samantha Faragalli"], "canonical_link": "https://www.closerweekly.com/posts/robert-de-niro-snapchat-131121/", "title": "Robert De Niro Finally Makes His Snapchat Debut \u2014 See His Selfies!", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Welcome to Snapchat, Robert De Niro!
