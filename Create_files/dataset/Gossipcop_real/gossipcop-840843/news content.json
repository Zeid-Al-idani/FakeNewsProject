It's a self-portrait that usually winds up getting shared on social media sites like Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and so forth. While just about everyone and their dog is guilty of snapping a selfie from time to time, celebrities have truly mastered the art of taking the most outrageous, funny, and bizarre selfies on the web. Check out a few of our favorites, below.\n\n01 of 25 Snoop Dogg Goes Full-On \"Silence of the Lambs\" Via Twitter/Snoopdogg. Are the lambs still screaming, Clarice? Snoop Dogg took a break from his perpetual 420 celebration by having some delicious pancakes. What he does with those pancakes is his own business!\n\n02 of 25 Madonna's Hairy Situation Via BCCL. Oh Madge. It seems the pop diva will do just about anything for attention these days, even... whatever this is. Could be worse! She could look like this horrible magazine cover in real life.\n\n03 of 25 Tyra Banks Goes Full-On Alien @tyrabanks Sure, she may be 99% forehead in this digitally-altered Instagram picture, but at least she's still SMIZING (smiling with her eyes).\n\n04 of 25 Lindsay Lohan's Warped Bathroom Via Instagram/LindsayLohan.

Via Instagram/imkevinbacon. Kevin Bacon posted this bizarre selfie to Instagram. Turns out it was just makeup for a movie role, but those pudgy cheeks definitely took the internet by surprise.\n\n08 of 25 Geraldo Rivera Gets Nekkid Via Twitter/GeraldoRivera. Oh, Geraldo, WHYYYYY? This photo was so poorly received that it actually cost Rivera some jobs. Turns out, his adoring fans did NOT want to see his 70 year-old dad bod. Weird, right?\n\n09 of 25 Lena Dunham's Undies What's going on here, Lena?. Courtesy: @lenadunham The Girls star frequently updates her unintentionally hilarious Instagram feed with gems like this one.\n\n10 of 25 Jessica Simpson Looks Great Via Twitter/JessicaSimpson. Not sure what's going on here? Join the club. I'm sure it made sense in Jessica Simpson's head.\n\n11 of 25 Nicolas Cage Is Soooooo Sleepy Speaking of annoying fan interactions.... When a Redditor was seated next to internet superstar Nicolas Cage on an airplane, she couldn't resist snapping this picture to share with the world.

Back when actress Amanda Bynes was publically melting down, she was quite the prolific selfie-taker.

International Space Station astronaut Aki Hoshide snapped this very scientific selfie while hovering in space back in 2012. According to NASA, \u201cVisible in this outworldly assemblage is the Sun, the Earth, two portions of a robotic arm, an astronaut\u2019s spacesuit, the deep darkness of space, and the unusual camera taking the picture.\"\n\n", "images": ["https://:0", "https://www.liveabout.com/thmb/YppV1FKLwe8oSUwItSZeWn_03dc=/220x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Humor2x-f7142b407e724a0b83823d713c2a2c0a.png", "https://www.liveabout.com/thmb/mO5DrUOTkRarFa4CaCWinEJ5F5I=/640x640/filters:fill(auto,1)/snoop-dogg-selfie-58b8bfa03df78c353c1920a2.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.liveabout.com/thmb/mO5DrUOTkRarFa4CaCWinEJ5F5I=/640x640/filters:fill(auto,1)/snoop-dogg-selfie-58b8bfa03df78c353c1920a2.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Beverly Jenkins"], "canonical_link": "https://www.liveabout.com/our-favorite-celebrities-taking-funny-selfies-1923904", "title": "25 of Our Favorite Celebrities Taking Funny Selfies", "meta_data": {"robots": "max-image-preview:large, NOODP, NOYDIR", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "As if we didn't already want Beyonce to be our BFF...!
