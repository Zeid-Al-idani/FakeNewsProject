Ronkko and Turner also are spending time isolated in separate cabins in Lapland beginning Wednesday.\n\nVisitors to the Kiasama museum in Helsinki can visit a cabin and send a text to LaBeouf, Ronkko and Turner, who can respond to visitors but can't talk to one another.\n\nThe public can view a livestream of museum-goers and the trio's texts on the museum's website.\n\nLaBeouf was arrested in January at his anti-Donald Trump livestream in New York.", "images": ["http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7395269&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://static.hollywoodreporter.com/sites/default/files/2017/04/gettyimages-622173568_-_h_2017-928x523.jpg", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/assets/1606142862/images/brand/writerimage-thr.jpg?5de16d88930168405795", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/assets/1606142862/images/brand/thr-logo-white.svg?5de16d88930168405795", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/assets/1606142862/images/brand/favicon.ico?5de16d88930168405795"], "top_img": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/assets/1606142862/images/brand/favicon.ico?5de16d88930168405795", "keywords": [], "authors": ["The Associated Press", "Thrnews Thr.Com"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/shia-labeouf-spending-a-month-living-alone-finland-cabin-993247", "title": "Shia LaBeouf Spending a Month Living Alone in Finland Cabin", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "sailthru.title": "Shia LaBeouf Spending a Month Living Alone in Finland Cabin", "sailthru.description": "His only communication with the outside world will come via text message to visitors to a Helsinki museum.", "sailthru.author": "the Associated Press", "sailthru.vertical": "Culture", "sailthru.date": "2017-04-12 11:00:25"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1491987625.0, "source": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com", "summary": ""}
