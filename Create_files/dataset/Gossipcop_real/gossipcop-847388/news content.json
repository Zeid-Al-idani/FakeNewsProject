Three months [after giving birth] I was on stage and I did not look at all like I just had twins. I don\u2019t know how she does it.\u201d\n\nThe Grammy winner, a self-proclaimed lover of fashion, described attending the annual Costume Institute Gala as finally being \u201cin the gang,\u201d and confessed her inability to part with any item from her vast wardrobe. \u201cI cannot give anything away because every piece that I buy has brought me to where I am tonight, They\u2019re part of every step that I take and I have an attachment to it,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can call it crazy. I keep everything, but I just keep buying a bigger [warehouse] space. I have 10,000 pairs of shoes.\u201d\n\nAlso in attendance were Valentino Garavani and Pierpaolo Picciolo, Marc Jacobs, Tom Ford, Christopher Kane, Alessandro Michele, Tommy Hilfiger and Nicolas Ghesqui\u00e8re.\n\n\u201cYou actually inspired both of us to go to law school,\u201d proclaimed two young guests to Reese Witherspoon. The \u201cLegally Blonde\u201d actress kept mum about her look for tonight but explained she collaborated on \u201cthe colors and shapes\u201d of the design, which will be \u201csomething out of the box.\u201d\n\nWith final Met Gala preparations looming, few guests lingered \u2014 with the exception of Valentino, who casually tucked himself in a corner as members of the Carlyle staff began clearing away bottles of Veuve Clicquot.", "images": ["https://wwd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/AdobeStock_256102894.jpeg?w=158&h=104&crop=1",
