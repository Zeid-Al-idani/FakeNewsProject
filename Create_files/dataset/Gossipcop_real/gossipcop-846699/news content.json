The label began in 1969 and the company was founded in 1973. Its Japanese flagship store is in Aoyama, Tokyo. It also establishes country-wide and world-wide store chain for various lines of products, including Dover Street Market, in major cities such asLondon, Melbourne, Hong Kong, and New York City.[1] Other than fashion, it expands its business to jewelry and perfume.[2]\n\nThe company shows their main collections during Paris Fashion Week and Paris Men's Fashion Week.[3] In 2017 it was reported that the company and its affiliates generates a revenue \"of over $280 million a year\".[4]\n\nHistory [ edit ]\n\nThe label was started in Tokyo by Rei Kawakubo in 1969 and established as a company in 1973. It is written in Japanese as \u30b3\u30e0\u30fb\u30c7\u30fb\u30ae\u30e3\u30eb\u30bd\u30f3 (Komu de Gyaruson), and translates as \"like boys\" in French.[5] The brand's name was inspired by Francoise Hardy's 1962 song \"Tous les gar\u00e7ons et les filles\", particularly from the line Comme les gar\u00e7ons et les filles de mon \u00e2ge.[6] The brand became successful in Japan in the 1970s and a menswear line was added in 1978. In 1981 the company had a debut show in Paris. Kawakubo's heavy use of black, as well as distressed fabrics and unfinished seams, were viewed negatively by French critics.[7]\n\nThroughout the 1980s, its clothes often were associated with a distressed and punk oriented style. In 1982, Kawakubo's collection which she named \"Destroy\" was heavily criticized. \"Women\u2019s Wear Daily called it the 'Hiroshima bag lady look,' and the Associated Press proclaimed Kawakubo the 'high priestess of the Jap wrap.'\" Unusual styles continued through the 1990s, many of which were disliked by experts.[8] But the company carried on, and in 2004, the company split business into handmade garments in France and non-handmade garments in Japan, Spain and Turkey. Product lines like Deux, Shirt, Tricot, Homme Plus Evergreen, Junya Watanabe, and Ganryu are handmade in France.[9] The product line Play, which is the most recognizable and mainstream CDG brand, is largely produced in Japan, Spain and Turkey, but some of its product are handmade in France.[9]\n\nPlay is the company's casual luxury line. It has a heart-shaped logo with two eyes. It is targeted at the younger market and is the best selling clothes line of the company.[citation needed] Filip Pagowski designed the heart logo and stitched onto Play pieces.[citation needed]\n\nPlay introduced collaborations with Nike, Jordan, and Louis Vuitton.[10] Dover Street Market Group carries both Play products and higher-end lines of the company.[citation needed]\n\nFashion [ edit ]\n\nIts collections are designed in the studio in Aoyama, Tokyo and manufactured in Japan, France, Spain, and Turkey. Over the years, the company has recurrently associated itself with the arts and cultural projects internationally. The 1997 spring-summer collection, often referred to the lumps and bumps collection, which contained fabric in bulk and balls on the garments, led to a collaboration, also in 1997, between Rei Kawakubo and New York-based choreographer Merce Cunningham called Scenario. The 2006 autumn/winter collection dealt with the concept of the persona,[11] the different ways to present self to the world. Fusing tailored menswear with more feminine elements such as corsets and flower printed dress fabrics, Persona was another collection that combined the feminine with the masculine.\n\nJunya Watanabe[12][13] and, as of recently, Tao Kurihara[14][15] have started their own sub-labels under the label. Both also were involved in designing for the casual women's knitwear line Tricot.\n\nComme des Gar\u00e7ons dress\n\nThe company have collaborated with various other labels over the years such as Hammerthor[16] and H&M.[17][18]\n\nBj\u00f6rk wore the label in the music video for Isobel.[citation needed] Some celebrities refer to the label and the founder. Frank Ocean devoted a song to the founder.[citation needed] John Waters devoted a chapter of his 2010 book Role Models to the label and founder.[citation needed] Swedish musician Jonna Lee collaborated with the company in the creation of her audiovisual album Everyone Afraid to Be Forgotten, where the fashion house designed the costumes for the film.[citation needed]\n\nExhibitions [ edit ]\n\nAfter the Paris d\u00e9but, the company exhibited photographs by Peter Lindbergh at the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris in 1986.[19] In 1990, it held an exhibition of sculpture. And again in 2005 it held an exhibition in Shinjuku, Tokyo of advertising and graphic designs.\n\nIn August 2010, the company opened a 19,000 square feet (1,800 m2), six-level flagship store in Seoul, South Korea, featuring a branded art-exhibition space, its first outside Japan.[20]\n\nIn May 2017, Metropolitan Museum of Art of New York held a fashion exhibition with theme Rei Kawakubo/Comme des Gar\u00e7ons Art of the In-Between.[21]\n\nPerfume [ edit ]\n\nThe company also produces a line of agendered fragrances, most of which are unconventional in the world of perfume aligned with the styles of its garments.[22]\n\nThe company released its first fragrance, Comme des Gar\u00e7ons, in 1994 [23] and its first anti-perfume Odeur 53 in 1998.[24] The anti-perfume is a blend of 53 non-traditional notes to create a modern and striking scent.[25] Some of these notes are oxygen, flash of metal, wash drying in the wind, mineral carbon, sand dunes, nail polish, cellulose, pure air of the high mountains, burnt rubber and flaming rock.[citation needed] Director John Waters and architect Stephen Alesch both wear the fragrance.[26][27]\n\nThe company also released the Luxe series Champaca, for which artist Katerina Jebb produced the visuals.[citation needed]\n\nAdrian Joffe, the founder's husband and the CEO of the company, set up two companies. Comme des Gar\u00e7ons Parfums is for licensing some of the perfumes to Puig from 2002[28][29] and Comme des Gar\u00e7ons Parfums Parfums for selling the rest by its own.[30]\n\nThe company developed a unisex fragrance, G I R L and released it on 28 August 2014.[31] Artist KAWS designed the bottle.[32]\n\nComme des Gar\u00e7ons lines [ edit ]\n\nDesigned by Rei Kawakubo\n\nComme des Gar\u00e7ons \u2013 main womenswear line (since 1969)\n\nComme des Gar\u00e7ons Noir \u2013 black-dominated womenswear collection (since 1987)\n\nComme des Gar\u00e7ons Comme Des Gar\u00e7ons \u2013 (a.k.a.
