She was 46.\n\nA new feature on the worldwide star by Bleacher Report\u2019s Jason King traces her stunning fall from grace back to her decision to walk away from a lucrative WWE contract at the height of her fame.\n\nKing\u2019s feature documents the troubled childhood Chyna was able to overcome to attain fame on a level few in the wrestling game have ever achieved.\n\nShe was earning seven figures a year around the turn of the century, had graced the cover of Playboy magazine, was appearing on late-night talk shows and had a best-selling autobiography.\n\n\u201cShe felt like she\u2019d really made it,\u201d Chyna\u2019s sister, Kathy, told Bleacher Report. \u201cShe loved being treated like a rock star.\u201d But it wouldn\u2019t last.\n\nTHE BEGINNING\n\nLaurer, who was billed as a six-foot powerhouse who could benchpress more than 140kg, debuted in Vince McMahon\u2019s promotion as a bodyguard for Paul \u201cTriple H\u201d Levesque in February, 1997.\n\nShe would often help the rising male star win through nefarious methods like delivering low blows to the groin of his opponents, but soon became a wrestling standout in her own right.\n\nChyna\u2019s star power and undoubted talent allowed her to go where no female wrestler had been before. After initial reluctance, male counterparts became willing to let her overpower them and in January, 1999, she became the first woman to ever take part in the Royal Rumble.\n\n\u201cShattered glass ceilings, kicked down doors, broke gender barriers,\u201d fellow female star Trish Status tweeted after Chyna\u2019s death. \u201cShe was an anomaly and untouchable.\u201d\n\nOffstage her life was flourishing too. A bit of a loner growing up who found solace in the gym, Chyna found a family in the WWE ranks \u2014 and a boyfriend in Triple H.\n\nThe pair were inseparable on the road, bonding over their dedication to a healthy lifestyle, a love of lifting weights and a determination to plot their way to the top of the wrestling world.\n\nTHE BREAKING POINT\n\nThe Bleacher Report feature reveals Chyna and Triple H\u2019s relationship began to deteriorate around 2000. \u201cFriends say Levesque wanted children; Laurer did not,\u201d King reported. \u201cShe was also jealous of the time Levesque spent with his parents and siblings during the rare days the WWE wasn\u2019t on the road.\n\n\u201cWhen she sensed Levesque was growing closer with Stephanie McMahon \u2014 the boss\u2019 daughter, whom he later married in 2003 \u2014 Laurer was crushed, telling numerous friends she\u2019d searched Levesque\u2019s briefcase and discovered a love letter from Stephanie.\u201d\n\nWhether a broken heart contributed to Chyna\u2019s decision to play hardball with WWE management over her next contract is up for debate. But the company claimed her outrageous base salary demand \u2014 according to Bleacher Report she refused to accept anything less than a starting point of $1 million after being offered $400,000 \u2014 was the reason for her 2001 exit.\n\nBut in several interviews over the ensuing years, Chyna claimed she was forced out \u2014 largely because of Stephanie\u2019s affection for Triple H.\n\n\u201cShe basically said that Paul was hers and I just had to deal with it,\u201d Chyna said, in a series of posts she made on Twitter in 2012 that were compiled by wrestlingnewsworld.com. \u201cI said that she was lucky her father was there or I would of ripped her face off. Vince said to go home and take some time off and then we will deal with it. I was near the end of my contract.\n\n\u201cSo basically, he never re-signed me. He chose his daughter\u2019s happiness over his talent and maybe he should have. But this was business. Even if he didn\u2019t want me on the show anymore because of the two of them, I couldn\u2019t of been a trainer of up and coming talent? I couldn\u2019t of done something else within WWE where I never would have had to run into or deal with Stephanie?\u201d\n\nBut her sister told Bleacher Report Chyna privately regretted her own role in the breakdown. \u201cJoanie told me a few years later that she regretted it,\u201d Kathy said. \u201cThe WWE was the only place where she was ever accepted. Once she lost that, she fell into a hole. And she never could climb out of it.\u201d\n\nTHE DOWNFALL\n\nAfter she left pro wrestling Chyna\u2019s life seemingly lurched from one crisis to the next. She developed a crystal meth habit and began a relationship with another wrestler Sean \u201cX-Pac\u201d Waltman, which was damaging to both parties.\n\nThey combined in the infamous pornographic film 1 Night in China, a venture which led to Chyna embarking on a career in the adult film industry. \u201cThat tape happened to me. It was done to me,\u201d Laurer told thedailybeast.com in 2011. \u201cIt traumatised me. When that came out, I felt really duped. That was life-changing in a really negative way.\u201d\n\nChyna battled mental illness, attempted suicide and despite rehabilitation attempts \u2014 both in America and Japan \u2014 was never able to silence the demons inside her.\n\n\u201cAll I kept thinking after she died was that poor girl,\u201d her sister told Bleacher Report. \u201cShe wanted so badly to be loved and accepted, but she never had a loving, connective relationship with anyone. People just used her and sucked her dry ... At least she\u2019s at peace now. At least she\u2019s at peace.\u201d", "images": ["https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/a9a1377efde4992c39d546f881ca4a77",
