He wonders what this would look like to somebody watching them. . .\u201cI worship you with my body,\u201d he whispers, as she pushes him inside her. Her labia pulls slickly across his face and he slips into darkness.\n\nPerhaps it\u2019s my misinterpretation, but when Gaiman writes \u201cit seems to him that he is hanging,\u201d I always envisioned Bilquis\u2019s client literally dangling between her legs. That\u2019s a visual the show would have had a very hard time making look realistic rather than cartoonish. Instead, Bilquis devours her man on a red-sheeted bed that the American Gods production team outfitted with both a trap door and a hidden compartment. The scene combined visual special effects with some carefully-timed choreography to create the episode\u2019s most stunning tableau, even in a premiere crammed with visual delights.\n\nWhen I spoke with Bilquis herself, Yetide Badaki, at Comic-Con last summer, the actress described filming the scene with an excited gleam in her eye. As a lifelong fan of Neil Gaiman\u2019s work, she said she knew how important it was for her entrance to convey both tragedy and frightening divine power. During the Comic-Con panel earlier in the day, star Ricky Whittle joked that they had nicknamed Badaki\u2019s nether regions \u201cJoy\u201d during filming. When I got technical and asked her if the nickname was required because there was some kind of prosthetic involved in the scene, Badaki told me with a grin, \u201cNo prosthetic. I think that you start to envision it in your mind, but I don\u2019t think you see Joy\u2014as far as I know.\u201d\n\nThat scene\u2014which easily could have been cut\u2014belongs in both the show and the first chapter of Gaiman\u2019s novel for a very good reason. And, no, it\u2019s not so American Gods can win some unofficial sexual arms race with Game of Thrones and Outlander. What we learn in this scene is that a) gods are real, b) they are diminished in power (we see Bilquis looking slightly faded before she absorbs her victim), and c) they are willing to stoop to trickery to get the vitality they need from their worshippers. Essentially, in this scene, we are seeing a blueprint of what\u2019s to come in the show, all tied up in a very alluring crimson-hued package.\n\nFor those unfamiliar with every nook and cranny of myth and legend, Bilquis\u2014also called Bilqis or Balkis or Makeda\u2014was the legendarily beautiful and uncommonly wise Queen of Sheba. Legend has it she is at least half djinn (or genie). In both the Bible and the Koran, she meets with\u2014and is not outwitted by\u2014King Solomon of Israel. Bilquis doesn\u2019t have a massive role to play in the novel American Gods; she has this unforgettable scene and another, even more tragic one. But according to Badaki, the role has been expanded for the TV series. So be on the lookout for some more insane sexual encounters. Something tells me you won\u2019t miss them.", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/56aa5153e4cf2b8d14c3880e/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/ricky-whittle-american-gods.jpg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/hwd/assets/logo-reverse.6ef96ab8686439a35176e2ff8b2c4487e92fbaae.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/57891fab814b54392dde94e3/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/t-bilquis-starz-vf.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59067d7c4654fa68050e36bf/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/ag-spoiler-czernobog.gif", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/58c427210a144505fae9ea0e/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/american-gods-episode-1-review.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/57891fab814b54392dde94e3/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/t-bilquis-starz-vf.jpg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/hwd/assets/logo-header.7b6624f3aa336c67441a33a3e19289ee14eaf5c7.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59022a71a9f28a122a3c28c3/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/week-in-fashion-04-28-ashley.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59022a752efecd23d0f29d7d/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/week-in-fashion-04-28-gigi.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/57930c76ce6d3bca38637541/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/bilquis.gif", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/58bd896df8260a3f190f2c0f/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/american-gods-first-look-orlando-jones.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59022a6b2efecd23d0f29d79/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/week-in-fashion-04-28-jennifer.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/57891fab814b54392dde94e3/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/t-bilquis-starz-vf.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Joanna Robinson", "Joanna Robinso"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/04/american-gods-sex-scene-bilquis-special-effects-book-yetide-badaki", "title": "That Insane American Gods Sex Scene Is Even Crazier in the Book", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "author": "Joanna Robinson", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2020", "description": "Plus how TV series pulled it all off.", "id": "59067b3616b60656d95fa9d3", "keywords": "television,american gods,web", "news_keywords": "television,american gods,web", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "59067b3616b60656d95fa9d3", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Plus how TV series pulled it all off.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/57891fab814b54392dde94e3/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/t-bilquis-starz-vf.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/57891fab814b54392dde94e3/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/t-bilquis-starz-vf.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "Plus how TV series pulled it all off.", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/57891fab814b54392dde94e3/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/t-bilquis-starz-vf.jpg", "site_name": "Vanity Fair", "title": "That Insane American Gods Sex Scene Is Even Crazier in the Book", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/04/american-gods-sex-scene-bilquis-special-effects-book-yetide-badaki"}, "article": {"content_tier": "metered", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@VanityFair", "description": "Plus how TV series pulled it all off.", "domain": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "image": {"src": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/57891fab814b54392dde94e3/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/t-bilquis-starz-vf.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@VanityFair", "title": "That Insane American Gods Sex Scene Is Even Crazier in the Book"}, "fb": {"app_id": 305927716147259, "pages": 8810407571}, "monetization": "$spsp.coil.com/donate/condenast", "google-signin-client_id": "1065629119444-svrqo31taikd2j0ji4dgjs9q3vul4133.apps.googleusercontent.com"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "summary": ""}
