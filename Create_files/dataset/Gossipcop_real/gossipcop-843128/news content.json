handed out renewals to 10 current series on Monday, including Supernatural, Arrow, Supergirl and Riverdale.\n\nSupernatural, which has been picked up for season 14, will continue its streak as the longest-running show in CW (and The WB) history.\n\nAll five of Greg Berlanti\u2019s superhero dramas will return next season, as the network picked up a seventh season of Arrow, a fifth season of The Flash, fourth seasons of Supergirl and DC\u2019s Legends of Tomorrow, and a second season for freshman drama Black Lightning.\n\nOther renewals include Riverdale, which will return for season 3, freshman series Dynasty, Crazy Ex-Girlfriend, which has been renewed for season 4, and Jane the Virgin, which has been renewed for season 5.\n\nFollowing the renewal, Crazy Ex-Girlfriend\u2018s co-creator and star Rachel Bloom tweeted that the show had been picked up for a \u201cfinal\u201d season, and although Bloom and her co-creator, Aline Brosh McKenna, have both spoken previously about having a four-season plan for the show, The CW will not confirm that season 4 will be the show\u2019s last.\n\nNews on the fates of Life Sentence, iZombie, The 100, and Valor is expected in May.\n\nThe network recently announced it would expand its primetime programming schedule to six nights, from Sunday to Friday, starting in October 2018.", "images":
