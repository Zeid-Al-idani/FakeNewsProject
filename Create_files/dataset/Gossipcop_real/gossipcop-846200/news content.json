Although he eventually did say he would exit the White House if the vote were not in his favor, that answer came after he first repeatedly cast doubt on the Electoral College and election in general. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a very hard thing to concede. Because we know there was massive fraud,\u201d he said when first asked if he would concede. Pennsylvania Certifies Biden as Winner, Driving Stake in Trump\u2019s Legal Effort\u201cTime isn\u2019t on our side \u2026 this was a massive fraud, this should never take place in this country, we\u2019re like a third-world country,\u201d he said, suggesting that faulty vote-counting machines gave Biden millions of extra votes.Asked a second time if he would concede if the Electoral College votes for Biden, Trump responded, \u201cWell if they do they made a mistake,\u201d before saying it\u2019s a \u201cpossibility\u201d and scolding a reporter who pressed him on the issue: \u201cDon\u2019t talk to me that way, you\u2019re just a lightweight.\u201dAsked by another reporter if he would \u201cleave this building\u201d if the Electoral College elects Biden, he said, \u201cCertainly, I will.\u201dWhile Trump and his legal team have repeatedly looked to throw out votes in states that Joe Biden carried, none of their challenges have proved successful.Key states such as Michigan, Pennsylvania and Georgia\u2014all of which Trump carried in 2016, before flipping blue this year\u2014certified their results this week, ensuring they will send a Democratic slate of voters to the Electoral College. Wisconsin and Arizona, two more states that flipped to Biden, are set to certify their results next week.\u201cMassive fraud has been found. We\u2019re like a third world country,\u201d Trump said, before launching back into allegations of voter fraud that have been repeatedly rebuffed in court and by state election officials of both parties.\u201cI did so well ... that they didn\u2019t know what to do,\u201d he said at one point of election results in Georgia, claiming that ballots for him were \u201cthrown away.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know what is going to happen. I know one thing, Joe Biden did not get 80 million votes. And I got 74 million but there were many ballots thrown away, so I got much more than that. But I got 74 million, 74 million is 11 million more than I got last time. \u2026 And it\u2019s millions more than Hillary Clinton got.\u201dUnderneath all of the bravado, Trump at one point slipped up and blasted \u201cthe Biden administration,\u201d apparently inadvertently recognizing Biden\u2019s win.While Trump has refused to concede and maintained that somehow, he would win states he had already lost, his administration has relented behind the scenes.Earlier this week, Emily Murphy, the head of the General Services Administrations\u2014a Trump appointee\u2014signed off on a letter officially allowing the presidential transition to begin. Murphy had previously refused to do so, a partisan move from a historically non-partisan agency.Even Trump appeared to have a moment of clarity Thursday regarding a potential COVID-19 cure and his future (or lack thereof) in the White House.\u201cDon\u2019t let Joe Biden take credit for the vaccine,\u201d he said.Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.
