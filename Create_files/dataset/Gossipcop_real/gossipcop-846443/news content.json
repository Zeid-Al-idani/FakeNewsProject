She started to cry a few times during the section, likely to get the most traction from the sit-down, in which she talks about the robbery and its aftermath. Kardashian West explained to a sympathetic DeGeneres that she is a \u201ccompletely different person\u201d following the harrowing incident.\n\n\u201cI know it sounds crazy, but I know that was meant to happen to me,\u201d she said. \u201cI don't want to start crying, but I know it was meant to happen. I feel like I'm such a different person. . . . I really feel like things happen in your life to teach you things. I was definitely materialistic before\u2014not that there's anything bad with having things and working hard to get those things, I'm really proud of everyone around me that's successful\u2014but I'm so happy that my kids get this me, that this is who I am raising my kids.\u201d\n\nKardashian West also said she does not feel the same need to show her possessions and jewelry on social media. \u201cI just don't care about that stuff anymore. I really don't. I'm not here to show off the way that I used to. It's just not who I am anymore.\u201d She told DeGeneres that she now understands that the thieves had been tracking her for two years, as they were monitoring and aware of her acquisitions and range of possessions, in part due to her social-media posts.\n\nShe teared up at the end of the segment, too, when describing her thought process during the robbery itself. \u201cAutomatically, your stomach drops. It's a feeling you just can't describe. I said a prayer. I said I know I'm going to heaven, I hope my kids and my husband are O.K.\u201d But now, looking back on it, she does believe it could have been more dire. \u201cIt does happen really fast, it was a good seven or eight minutes of torture, but when I look back and I analyze it, it could have been worse. They weren't really aggressive; it could have been way worse, so I don't want to sound like I'm not grateful. I'm out, I'm home, I'm safe. I'm such a better person. Let's move on.\u201d\n\nIn addition to sharing charming anecdotes about North and Saint (North\u2019s personality is like Kanye\u2019s, Saint\u2019s is like hers), she also had much to say about Caitlyn Jenner\u2019s new book, The Secrets of Our Lives, which the Kardashian family believes does not portray matriarch Kris Jenner fairly. Kardashian West\u2014who says she hasn\u2019t spoken to Jenner in a few weeks\u2014said she is disappointed in the portrayal.\n\n\u201cMy heart breaks for my mom, you know, because I feel like she\u2019s been through so much and [Caitlyn is] promoting this book and she\u2019s saying all these things. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary, and I just feel like it\u2019s unfair, things aren\u2019t truthful.\u201d (The central claim in the book, leveled by Caitlyn, is that Kris was aware Caitlyn identified as a woman before they got married.)\n\n\u201cKendall and Kylie, that\u2019s their dad, and I think my mom\u2019s been so respectful for so long and always wanting Caitlyn around and always wanting to have a great relationship with Caitlyn,\u201d Kardashian West said. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s taken [Jenner] a really long time to be honest with herself, so I don\u2019t expect her to be honest about my mom now. But it\u2019s just so hurtful. I wish her all the success in the world but not at our expense.\u201d\n\nIn the episode of Keeping Up With the Kardashians scheduled to air Sunday, Kim will be seen making one of her first public appearances, in Dubai, following the robbery.", "images": ["https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-header.b6748104d0d362745b508aebea5a86c913809200.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/586fef94eef2db26505c7f79/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/t-Keeping-Up-With-the-Kardashians-Kim-Kanye-West.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/575740de7e88197902288540/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/north-west-kim-kardashian-kanye-west-ss03.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/58c95f2a65c51404f0841834/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/kim-kardashian-paris-robbery.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/575740de7e8819790228853d/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/north-west-kim-kardashian-kanye-west-ss01.jpg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-reverse.6ef96ab8686439a35176e2ff8b2c4487e92fbaae.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5901f939a9f28a122a3c28aa/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/kim-kardashian-ellen-robbery.png", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/54d3a8f99f9fa5f230b14590/1:1/w_90%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/58337b0cca6f7ee00ec29072/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/kim-kardashian-heist-paris-france-01.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/575740de7e8819790228853e/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/north-west-kim-kardashian-kanye-west-ss02.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5901f939a9f28a122a3c28aa/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/kim-kardashian-ellen-robbery.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Josh Duboff", "Josh Dubof", "Kenzie Bryan", "Mark Sea"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2017/04/kim-kardashian-paris-robbery-caitlyn-jenner-north-saint-ellen-show", "title": "Kim Kardashian Says the Paris Robbery Was \u201cMeant to Happen\u201d to Her", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "author": "Josh Duboff", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2020", "description": "Also, the star is not pleased with Caitlyn Jenner.", "id": "5901f85466498c1bfe5eab25", "keywords": "celebrity,kim kardashian,caitlyn jenner,paris robbery,kim kardashian west,web", "news_keywords": "celebrity,kim kardashian,caitlyn jenner,paris robbery,kim kardashian west,web", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5901f85466498c1bfe5eab25", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Also, the star is not pleased with Caitlyn Jenner.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5901f939a9f28a122a3c28aa/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/kim-kardashian-ellen-robbery.png\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5901f939a9f28a122a3c28aa/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/kim-kardashian-ellen-robbery.png\"}", "og": {"description": "Also, the star is not pleased with Caitlyn Jenner.", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5901f939a9f28a122a3c28aa/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/kim-kardashian-ellen-robbery.png", "site_name": "Vanity Fair", "title": "Kim Kardashian Says the Paris Robbery Was \u201cMeant to Happen\u201d to Her", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2017/04/kim-kardashian-paris-robbery-caitlyn-jenner-north-saint-ellen-show"}, "article": {"content_tier": "metered", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@VanityFair", "description": "Also, the star is not pleased with Caitlyn Jenner.", "domain": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "image": {"src": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5901f939a9f28a122a3c28aa/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/kim-kardashian-ellen-robbery.png?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@VanityFair", "title": "Kim Kardashian Says the Paris Robbery Was \u201cMeant to Happen\u201d to Her"}, "fb": {"app_id": 305927716147259, "pages": 8810407571}, "monetization": "$spsp.coil.com/donate/condenast", "google-signin-client_id": "1065629119444-svrqo31taikd2j0ji4dgjs9q3vul4133.apps.googleusercontent.com"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/TzKeiCfHVu0"], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "summary": ""}
