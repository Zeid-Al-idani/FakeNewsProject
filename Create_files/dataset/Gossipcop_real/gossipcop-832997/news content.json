The season begins the day after the election. Character and additional plot details are being kept under wraps.\n\nHaynes, who is new to the franchise, joins fellow newbies to the anthology including Billie Lourd and Billy Eichner. Returning castmembers include Sarah Paulson and Evan Peters.\n\nThis marks Haynes' second collaboration with Murphy. He also appeared in a few episodes of Fox's Scream Queens.\n\nHaynes is repped by UTA and Ziffren Brittenham.", "images": ["https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/assets/1606142862/images/homepage-icons/live-feed.svg?5de16d88930168405795", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7395269&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://static.hollywoodreporter.com/sites/default/files/2016/06/colton_haynes_headshot_p_2016.jpg", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/assets/1606142862/images/brand/thr-logo-white.svg?5de16d88930168405795", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/assets/1606142862/images/brand/favicon.ico?5de16d88930168405795"], "top_img": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/assets/1606142862/images/brand/favicon.ico?5de16d88930168405795", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lesley Goldberg", "Lesley.Goldberg Thr.Com"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/american-horror-story-enlists-colton-haynes-season-7-1015446", "title": "'American Horror Story' Enlists Colton Haynes for Season 7", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "sailthru.title": "'American Horror Story' Enlists Colton Haynes for Season 7", "sailthru.description": "The 'Arrow' and 'Teen Wolf' grad joins a cast that also includes Billie Lourd.", "sailthru.author": "Lesley Goldberg", "sailthru.vertical": "Live Feed", "sailthru.date": "2017-06-20 17:34:40"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1497972880.0, "source": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com", "summary": ""}
