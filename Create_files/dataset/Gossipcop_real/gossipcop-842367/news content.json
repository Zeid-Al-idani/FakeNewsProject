Gomez, who, along with her mom, pushed for the series to be made, served as an executive producer on the show.\n\n\"I would do anything to be able to have a good influence on this generation, but I definitely relate to everything that was going on,\" said the 24-year-old during a Netflix press event in February. \"I was there for the last episode, and I was a mess just seeing it all come to life, because I've experienced that.\"\n\nNow, the story is getting even more personal for Gomez. Along with two of the show's breakout stars, Tommy Dorfman (who plays Ryan Shaver) and Alisha Boe (Jessica Davis), the pop star got a semicolon tattoo over the weekend to represent Project Semicolon, a suicide prevention and mental health awareness organization. The symbolic punctuation represents the idea that when one thought ends, a new one begins \u2014 that \"this is not the end but a new beginning.\"\n\nThe trio showed off the matching ink on Instagram. \"Project Semicolon is a movement dedicated to presenting hope for those suffering from depression, thoughts of suicide, addiction, and self-injury,\" captioned Boe on her Instagram.\n\nDorfman also describes his own personal struggles with mental health in his past. \"I struggled with addiction and depression issues through high school and early college,\" he wrote alongside a photo of the gang's matching tattoos. \"I reached out and asked for help. At the time, I thought my life was over, I thought I'd never live past the age of 21. Today I'm grateful to be alive, in this new chapter of life in recovery, standing with my colleagues and friends, making art that helps other people.\"", "images": ["http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7395269&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/assets/1606142862/images/brand/writerimage-thr.jpg?5de16d88930168405795", "https://static.hollywoodreporter.com/sites/default/files/2016/11/gettyimages-624757174-h2016-928x523.jpg", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/assets/1606142862/images/brand/thr-logo-white.svg?5de16d88930168405795", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/assets/1606142862/images/brand/favicon.ico?5de16d88930168405795"], "top_img": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/assets/1606142862/images/brand/favicon.ico?5de16d88930168405795", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sam Reed", "Thrnews Thr.Com"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/selena-gomez-tattoo-matching-semicolons-13-reasons-why-cast-992400", "title": "Selena Gomez and '13 Reasons Why' Castmates Got Matching Tattoos", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "sailthru.title": "Selena Gomez and '13 Reasons Why' Castmates Got Matching Tattoos", "sailthru.description": "For a good cause.", "sailthru.author": "Sam Reed", "sailthru.vertical": "Style", "sailthru.date": "2017-04-10 10:01:24"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1491811284.0, "source": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com", "summary": ""}
