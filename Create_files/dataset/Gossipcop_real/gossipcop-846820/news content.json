At first, they meet and Russell talks about how cool and fun Corden is, giving him a \"light\" punch on the arm that leaves Corden clutching himself in pain.\n\nThe next time they interact, he kicks Corden in the face while telling him how much he loves him.\n\n\"I love you too, you crazy bastard,\" Corden says as he lays in the fetal position on the floor.\n\nThe third incident is particularly volatile, with Russell happily throwing Corden through walls with a smile. When Corden ends up in the hospital, he wakes up to realize that he can never truly escape Kurt Russell, even in a medical institution.\n\nThe veteran actor, who starred in Escape From New York and Escape From L.A. among other films, will next hit theaters in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, out May 5.\n\nWatch the sketch below.", "images": ["http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7395269&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://static.hollywoodreporter.com/sites/default/files/2017/04/escape_from_kurt_russell-928x523.jpg", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/assets/1606142862/images/brand/writerimage-thr.jpg?5de16d88930168405795", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/assets/1606142862/images/brand/thr-logo-white.svg?5de16d88930168405795", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/assets/1606142862/images/brand/favicon.ico?5de16d88930168405795"], "top_img": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/assets/1606142862/images/brand/favicon.ico?5de16d88930168405795", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Thr Staff", "Thrnews Thr.Com"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/kurt-russell-beats-up-james-corden-late-late-show-998399", "title": "Kurt Russell Beats Up James Corden in 'Late Late Show' Sketch", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "sailthru.title": "Kurt Russell Beats Up James Corden in 'Late Late Show' Sketch", "sailthru.description": "Try as he might, Corden can't escape the actor.", "sailthru.author": "THR staff", "sailthru.vertical": "Television", "sailthru.date": "2017-04-28 08:20:35"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1493360435.0, "source": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com", "summary": ""}
