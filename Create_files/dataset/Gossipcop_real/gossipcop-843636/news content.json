Before welcoming two babies into the world, Beyonce and hubby Jay Z jetted off to a private island in Bora Bora for a super romantic babymoon! Read all about their exotic vacation, here!\n\nHoneymoons are SO 2016! This year is all about babymoons, and Beyonce, 35, is living proof of that! The expectant singer, who is currently missing out on Coachella where she was supposed to perform, is enjoying some serious R&R in Bora Bora with her husband, Jay Z, 47. Oh, and did we mention they\u2019re reportedly chilling on a PRIVATE ISLAND in Tahiti? The stars are taking it easy on their \u201clow-key\u201d vacation before Beyonce gives birth to her twins, according to the Daily Mail. Life is like a dream come true for the married couple, and the best part hasn\u2019t even happened yet.\n\nOf course the best part is going to be welcoming the twins! The \u201cFormation\u201d hitmaker hasn\u2019t announced her due date yet, but it\u2019s probably best is she doesn\u2019t do anything too active or adventurous in Bora Bora. Instead of going on hikes or trying out water sports, Beyonce and her rapper hubby are actually catching up on much needed rest. \u201c[They\u2019re spending] one-on-one time together reading and taking naps,\u201d a source explained to E!, adding that they aren\u2019t doing much \u201cother than relaxing.\u201d Beyonce did spend some time in the ocean while Jay Z went waterskiing.\n\nMeanwhile, Lady Gaga is going to take Beyonce\u2019s place on Saturday night at Coachella. After Queen Bey announced her pregnancy via Instagram, fans feared that she wouldn\u2019t be able to perform as the headliner. Doctors also recommended that Beyonce cancel as it could be dangerous for her health, but thankfully Mother Monster stepped in at the last minute.\n\nHollywoodLifers, aren\u2019t you mega jealous of Beyonce\u2019s babymoon in Bora Bora?!", "images": ["https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/travis-scott-skips-houston-for-kylie-and-stormi-mega-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/pregnant-beyonce-jay-z-jet-off-to-bora-bora-ftr.jpg", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/sport-bra-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/celebrity-women-who-arent-afraid-of-talking-about-masturbation.jpg?w=230&crop=1", "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/tyson-vs-jones-live-stream.jpg?w=230&crop=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/pregnant-beyonce-jay-z-jet-off-to-bora-bora-ftr.jpg?w=600", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/etsy-BF.gif?w=230&crop=1", "https://footwearnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/vanessa-hudgens-crop-top-jeans.jpg?w=230&crop=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://tvline.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/the-masked-singer-paul-anka-broccoli-season-4-interview-video.jpg?w=230&crop=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/patrick-mahomes-fiancee-baby-bump-ap-images-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/pregnant-beyonce-jay-z-jet-off-to-bora-bora-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sophie Radvan", "Erika Janes", "Claire Gillespie", "Mia Maguire", "Kimberly Roots", "Tim Chan", "Claudia Miller"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2017/04/15/beyonce-jay-z-bora-bora-babymoon-vacation-twins/", "title": "Pregnant Beyonce & Jay Z Jet Off To Bora Bora For Romantic Babymoon Before Twins\u2019 Arrival", "meta_data": {"description": "Who knew being pregnant with twins could be so...
