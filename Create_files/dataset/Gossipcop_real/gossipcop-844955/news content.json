In the single \u201cSorry\u201d, which features a cameo from Serena Williams in the video, she sings: \u201cHe only want me when I\u2019m not there, He better call Becky with the good hair.\u201d With themes in the album revolving around relationships, infidelity and reconciliation, the rumour mill went into overdrive.\n\nThe Beyhive flooded New York designer Rachel Roy\u2019s Instagram with bee and lemon emojis on Sunday after some accused her of being \u201cBecky\u201d following an Instagram post referencing \u201cgood hair\u201d.
