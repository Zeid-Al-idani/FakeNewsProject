A remix version featuring Canadian singer Justin Bieber was released on April 17, 2017, which helped to improve the song's chart performance in numerous countries, including various number-one positions. \"Despacito\" has been widely credited by music journalists as being instrumental in popularizing Spanish-language pop music in the mainstream market again.\n\nIt is a reggaeton and Latin pop song composed in common time with lyrics about desiring a sexual relationship, performed in a smooth and romantic way. \"Despacito\" received generally favorable reviews from music critics, who praised the fusion between Latin and urban rhythms, its catchiness, and its text painting. It has received Latin Grammy Awards for Record of the Year, Song of the Year, Best Urban Fusion/Performance, and Best Short Form Music Video at the 18th Latin Grammy Awards. \"Despacito\" has been also ranked among the best Latin songs of all-time and the best songs of 2017 by various publications, which referred to it as one of the most successful Spanish-language tracks in pop music history.\n\nThe song topped the charts of 47 countries and reached the top 10 of six others. In the United States, it became the first song primarily in Spanish to top the Billboard Hot 100 since Los del R\u00edo's \"Macarena\" in 1996, subsequently tying the longest-reigning number one on the Billboard Hot 100 at the time with 16 weeks, as well as becoming the longest-running number-one on the Hot Latin Songs chart with 56 weeks.

Panamanian singer and songwriter Erika Ender ) co-wrote the song.\n\nThe lyrics of \"Despacito\" were written in late 2015 in Luis Fonsi's house in Miami because he wanted to record a \"swinging song\" for his new album after two years without releasing new music.[3][4] He woke up mulling about \"a song called 'Despacito'\" and invited Brazilian-Panamanian singer and songwriter Erika Ender to a songwriting session.[5] Fonsi co-wrote the song on a Gibson Emmylou Harris guitar.[6] He originally composed it as a cumbia and pop song with lyrics written as a ballad but decided to give it an \"urban injection\" and sent a demo to reggaeton artist Daddy Yankee.[4] They recorded the song at Noisematch Studios in Miami in late 2016.[7][8] Daddy Yankee improvised his verse in a corner of the studio's control room while thinking about his father playing bongos and wrote the post-chorus.[8][9] It was produced by Mauricio Rengifo and Andr\u00e9s Torres; the former is known as a member of Colombian pop duo Cali & El Dandee and the latter is known for previously working with David Bisbal, Thal\u00eda, and Ricky Martin.[10][11] It was mixed by American engineer Jaycen Joshua at Larrabee Sound Studios in North Hollywood, Los Angeles.[12]\n\nLuis Fonsi does not consider it a reggaeton song but feels that \"it does have a reggaeton energy and an subtle urban beat.\"[4] Ender stated that the track \"went through several arrangements\" until Fonsi got \"exactly the arrangement he wanted.\"[5] Fonsi described \"Despacito\" as a very melodic song that can adapt well to many other music genres.[13] Due to the sensual nature of the song, they \"needed to be responsible with a good lyric\" and Ender's approach to writing for Fonsi was \"to take care of how to say things with a good taste.\"[3] In April 2017, American singer and songwriter Nicky Jam revealed that the original version of \"Despacito\" featured him instead of Daddy Yankee, but had to decline due to the song's release interfering with the launch of his album F\u00e9nix.[14]\n\nJustin Bieber remix version [ edit ]\n\nThree months after the release of \"Despacito\", Canadian singer Justin Bieber wanted to record a remix version after seeing how people reacted to the song in a Colombian nightclub during a tour in South America.[15] The following day, Luis Fonsi received a phone call from Universal Latin about the remix and authorized the label to send the track to Bieber.[16] Bieber's manager Scooter Braun contacted his vocal producer Josh Gudwin to work on the song, who flew to Bogot\u00e1 and recorded Justin Bieber's vocals in Estudios Audiovisi\u00f3n.[17]\n\nJustin Bieber sang in Spanish for the first time in his career with the help of Colombian musician Juan Felipe Samper.[18][19] What cost Justin Bieber the most was the 'ere' (\u027e) sound in words like \"laberinto\" (labyrinth), \"paredes\" (walls) and \"manuscrito\" (manuscript).[19] Samper wrote the Spanish-language lyrics phonetically to ease Bieber's pronunciation, which was \"perfectly\" achieved in two hours.[19] After a four-hour recording session, Gudwin sent Bieber's vocal tracks to Australian sound engineer Chris O'Ryan for vocal tuning.[17] Gudwin concluded the remix's production in Parrot Cay, Turks and Caicos Islands with the mixing of Luis Fonsi's English-language vocals, whose lyrics were written by American songwriter Marty James.[17] The entire process until the release date took six days.[17] In June 2017, English musician Ed Sheeran revealed that he wanted to record a remix version of the song but lost out to Justin Bieber.[20]\n\nComposition [ edit ]\n\n\"Despacito\" is a reggaeton and Latin pop song composed in common time (4\n\n4 time) with a length of three minutes and forty-seven seconds and written in the key of B minor with a tempo of 89 beats per minute and a common chord progression of Bm\u2014G\u2014D\u2014A.[21][22][23] The vocals span from F# 4 to A 5 .[24] Its implicit lyrics are about having a sexual relationship in a smooth and romantic way, making heavy use of allegories.[25] However, Luis Fonsi expressed that some lines are free for interpretation.[26]\n\n\"Despacito\" A 22-second sample of \"Despacito\" featuring part of the chorus.

Some music publications believed the single's success was influenced by a trend of combining Latin pop and urban music.[29] Fonsi referred to it as \"the new pop\" and Ender said that \"everyone is making this type of fusions.\"[3] Luis Fonsi also stated that two weeks after the release of the song and its music video he started receiving calls from \"people who normally don't call, people who only call when something different is going on.\" He got calls from Ricky Martin, Juan Luis Guerra, Marc Anthony and other artists telling him that the track was a \"home run.\"[30]\n\nSebastian Wernke-Schmiesing of Dance-Charts journal stated that \"a simple 4/4 time, Spanish guitar sounds, a crisp bass, and the excellent vocals by Luis Fonsi and [Daddy Yankee] were enough to get a hit single from the start.\"[31] Leila Cobo of Billboard praised its \"undeniable immediate catchiness\" and wrote that the song \"is a clever blend of romantic Latin pop with a reggaeton beat and subtly naughty lyrics.\"[32][33] Robert Joffred of Medium's culture blog That Good You Need highlighted the use of a steel-string guitar to play flamenco-style melodies instead of a nylon-string guitar, as well as the presence of \"swung rhythms\" when the word \"Despacito\" is sung at the beginning of the chorus[28] He referred to the text painting as \"pretty genius.\"[28] Raisa Bruner of Time magazine described the single as \"an infectious Latin melody amped up with reggaeton grooves and an irresistible dance tune.\"[34]\n\nSpanish record producer Nah\u00fam Garc\u00eda stated that \"the way the rhythm breaks before the chorus is genius\" and that this \"trick\" in particular is not common in pop music.[35] Joshua Barrie of Irish Mirror gave a negative opinion about the lyrics, referring to them as \"quite rude and a bit creepy\" and stating that \"some people might find them offensive.\"[36] On the other hand, an editor of Spanish music website Jenesaispop stated that \"the melody is very good, the lyrics are sexy without being vulgar and above all its structure is interesting.\"[37] Felix Contreras of National Public Radio praised the writing, arrangement and performances.[38]\n\nThe remix version featuring Justin Bieber was released on April 17, 2017 by Universal Music Latin, Republic Records, Def Jam Recordings, RBMG and School Boy Records.[39] Its official audio video garnered 20 million views on YouTube on its first 24 hours, making it the third-highest debut for a music-related video in 2017 as of September.[40] Caroline Soriano of Ernstars magazine stated that Bieber's voice \"sounds appealing with the song,\" whose remix version make it sound \"a little bit better.\"[41] Mike Senior of Sound on Sound gave a negative review of the remix's mixing by criticizing its polarity inversion regarding the original version and Justin Bieber's louder vocal track than Daddy Yankee's.[42] As to the original version, Senior referred to the first appearance of the \"Despacito\" hook line as a \"masterstroke\".[42]\n\nIn July 2017, officials from the Government of Malaysia reported that \"Despacito\" was being banned from airing on government-owned broadcast stations as a result of public complaints.[43] Government ministers said that the song was considered un-Islamic and that its lyrics were \"not suitable to be heard.\"[43]\n\nAccolades [ edit ]\n\n\"Despacito\" has received various awards and nominations following its commercial success.

world.\"[137] Andrew Unterberger of Billboard stated that \"2017 was the year that Latin pop took over the United States\" due to the song and its quick impact on \"Mi Gente\", Camila Cabello's \"Havana\", and the chart performance of acts including Maluma, Ozuna and Bad Bunny, who achieved their biggest hits in the country.[138]\n\nIn July 2017, it was reported that tourist interest in
