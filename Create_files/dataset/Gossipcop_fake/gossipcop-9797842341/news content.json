And even Drew Barrymore isn\u2019t safe! The Blended star was spotted getting cozy with ex-husband Will Kopelman, leaving the world wondering if they are getting back together? The couple, who split in 2016 after four years of marriage, have been spending nights together, an insider tells In Touch.\n\n\u201cWhen Drew was filming Santa Clarita Diet, Will would fly into LA from NYC. Even though he had a hotel room, he ended up sleeping at Drew\u2019s house from time to time. Then when she finished shooting in October, it became a more regular thing. They enjoy each other\u2019s company,\u201d revealed the insider.\n\n(Photo Credit: Getty Images)\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re both in great places in their lives,\u201d says an insider. Spending so much time together has reminded Drew, 42, and Will, 40 \u2014 who share daughters Olive, 5, and Frankie, 3 \u2014 of the way things used to be. \u201cIt\u2019s like it was at the beginning of their relationship, so relaxed and comfortable,\u201d says the insider, adding that a reconciliation \u201cis a real possibility.\u201d\n\nDrew revealed that she felt like the \u201cbiggest failure\u201d after announcing her divorce. \u201cLike, when you get divorced, you break up with somebody and you\u2019re like, \u2018Yeah, that didn\u2019t work,\u2019 and you get divorced, [but] when you get divorced you\u2019re like, \u2018I\u2019m the biggest failure. This is the biggest failure.\u2019 It\u2019s so shameful and hard to actually go through that, even privately.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t the Never Been Kissed star\u2019s first divorce. She was previously married when she was 19 years old to Jeremy Thomas and fellow actor Tom Green in 2001. Both marriages only lasted a year.", "images": ["https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/shutterstock_editorial_10543684k.jpg?crop=518px%2C193px%2C2424px%2C2424px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/drew-barrymore-relationship.jpg?resize=750%2C421", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/drew-barrymore-relationship.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Ree-Drummond.jpg?crop=0px%2C447px%2C2346px%2C1329px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/drew-barrymore-instagram-selfie.png?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/LTG_HOL_AMI_11.24.20_300x490.jpg?fit=300%2C490", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/drew-barrymore-cats-getty.png?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/goldie-hawn-recalls-the-special-way-kurt-russell-looked-at-her-kids-when-they-started-dating.jpg?crop=0px%2C349px%2C2336px%2C2336px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/marlene-dietrich-1948.jpg?crop=0px%2C257px%2C2509px%2C1423px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Amber-Laign-and-Robin-Roberts.jpg?resize=90%2C90", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Prince-William-gets-new-title.jpg?crop=476px%2C0px%2C2875px%2C2875px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/drew-barrymore-daughters-4.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Melissa-Rivers-Reflects-on-Mom-Joans-Legacy-After-Her-Death.jpg?crop=0px%2C59px%2C3000px%2C1699px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/goldie-hawns-cutest-photos-with-kids-kate-oliver-wyatt-and-boston-2014.jpg?crop=0px%2C41px%2C2220px%2C1258px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/CL4420_cover_final.jpg?w=300", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/joyce-bulifant-mary-tyler-moore-actress-life-career.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/drew-barrymore-will-kopelman.jpg?w=750&h=750&crop=1&resize=1180%2C1180", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Joan-Lunden-Is-Appreciative-After-Beating-Breast-Cancer.jpg?crop=0px%2C169px%2C3494px%2C1978px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linda-ronstadt-health-update.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/dave-coulier-talks-full-house-wife-melissa-and-future-work02.jpg?crop=281px%2C113px%2C2015px%2C1140px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Prince-Harry-bothered-by-Prince-William-title.jpg?crop=452px%2C0px%2C3583px%2C3582px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Geena-Davis-Feels-Better-at-64-\u2014-There-Are-No-Limits.jpg?crop=0px%2C88px%2C3000px%2C1699px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/martin-lawrence-kids.jpg?crop=741px%2C0px%2C2204px%2C2204px&resize=90%2C90"], "top_img": "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/drew-barrymore-relationship.jpg?resize=750%2C421", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Closer Staff"], "canonical_link": "https://www.closerweekly.com/posts/drew-barrymore-will-kopelman-back-together-152639/", "title": "Are Drew Barrymore and Will Kopelman Back Together?", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "It's that time of year \u2014 where love is clearly in the air!
