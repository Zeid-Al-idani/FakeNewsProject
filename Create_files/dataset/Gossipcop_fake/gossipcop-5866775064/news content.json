Amidst new rumors that Blake is having trouble in his relationship with Gwen Stefani, 47, an insider tells InTouch that Miranda wants to confront her ex to finally get closure. \u201cIt needs to be done,\u201d the source tells the mag. \u201cThere\u2019s still a lot of unfinished business between [Miranda] and Blake. She needs to look straight into Blake\u2019s eyes, ask certain questions, and get answers.\u201d\n\nThere are no plans set for this meeting to actually take place just yet, but the mag claims that if it does happen, Miranda plans to go in with a \u201cclear head,\u201d although that might not be so easy. \u201cThis could get heated,\u201d the insider admits. \u201cAs soon as the emotions come up, [Miranda] may lose it.\u201d This doesn\u2019t mean the 33-year-old wants to get back together with her ex, though \u2014 actually, it\u2019s just the opposite. She\u2019s very happy with her man, Anderson East, 29, but feels a face-to-face with Blake is what she needs to fully be ready to commit to another relationship, according to the source.\n\n\u201cShe feels that [she and Blake] have both grown so much since their divorce that meeting up is essential for them to have healthy relationships in the future,\u201d InTouch\u2019s insider says. \u201cWho knows, maybe this meeting with Blake will have them walk away as friends. Either way, they\u2019ll definitely be in a better place.\u201d\n\nAs for the rumored trouble between Blake and Gwen, we\u2019re going to take that report (from OK! magazine) with a grain of salt. After all, they were just spotted looking totally in love on Aug. 20! Plus, HollywoodLife.com has heard EXCLUSIVELY that they already have plans for a fun Labor Day together, so hopefully he\u2019ll pop back up on her social media this weekend!\n\nHollywoodLifers, do you think Blake and Miranda will meet up?", "images": ["https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/lori-harvey-michael.b-jordan-spotted-ap-ftr-1.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/k-beauty.gif?w=230&crop=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Megan-Thee-Stallion-Admits-She-Has-\u2018Chemistry-With-DaBaby-ap-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/christina-milian-one-piece-swimsuit-splashnews-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/macys-parade-going-virtual.jpg?w=230&crop=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/alyssa_norwin.jpg?w=48", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/miranda-lambert-meet-with-blake-shelton-ftr.jpg", "https://tvline.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/the-prom-movie-trailer.jpg?w=230&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/miranda-lambert-meet-with-blake-shelton-ftr.jpg?w=620", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ols5-092119-4402-a-7-1.jpg?w=230&crop=1", "https://footwearnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/dollar-tree-store.jpg?w=230&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/miranda-lambert-meet-with-blake-shelton-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Alyssa Norwin", "Reshma Gopaldas", "Elizabeth Denton", "Andy Swift", "Claire Shaffer", "Sheena Butler-Young", "Deputy Editor Of New York City"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2017/08/30/miranda-lambert-blake-shelton-reunion-meeting-gwen-stefani/", "title": "Miranda Lambert Desperate To Meet With Blake Shelton After His Reported Split From Gwen Stefani", "meta_data": {"description": "Miranda Lambert is reportedly desperate for a reunion with her ex, Blake Shelton, and is urgently trying to plan a meeting with him.", "news_keywords": "Blake Shelton, Gwen Stefani, Miranda Lambert", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1400650284", "generator": "WordPress 5.5.2", "author": "Alyssa Norwin", "theme-color": "#fff", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-touch-fullscreen": "YES", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Hollywood Life", "application-name": "Hollywood Life", "fb": {"pages": 94724837471}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "onesignal": "wordpress-plugin", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Miranda Lambert Desperate To Meet With Blake Shelton After His Reported Split From Gwen Stefani", "url": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2017/08/30/miranda-lambert-blake-shelton-reunion-meeting-gwen-stefani/", "description": "On the same day rumors spread that there\u2019s trouble in paradise for Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani, another shocking report claims Miranda Lambert is desperately trying to meet up with her ex!", "site_name": "Hollywood Life", "image": {"identifier": "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/miranda-lambert-meet-with-blake-shelton-ftr.jpg", "width": 620, "height": 349, "alt": "Miranda Lambert Blake Shelton"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-08-30T15:38:38+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-08-30T16:28:06+00:00"}, "twitter": {"text": {"title": "Miranda Lambert Desperate To Meet With Blake Shelton After His Reported Split From Gwen Stefani"}, "image": {"identifier": "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/miranda-lambert-meet-with-blake-shelton-ftr.jpg?w=620", "alt": "Miranda Lambert Blake Shelton"}, "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@HollywoodLife", "creator": "@https://twitter.com/alyssanorwin/", "title": "Miranda Lambert Desperate To Meet With Blake Shelton After His Reported Split From Gwen Stefani", "description": "Miranda Lambert is reportedly desperate for a reunion with her ex, Blake Shelton, and is urgently trying to plan a meeting with him."}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=128"}, "movies": ["https://www.dailymotion.com/embed/video/x5h6mov"], "publish_date": 1504044000.0, "source": "http://hollywoodlife.com", "summary": ""}
