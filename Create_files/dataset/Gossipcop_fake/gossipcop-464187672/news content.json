These included: William Shakespeare, Queen Elizabeth II, David Beckham, J. K. Rowling, The Beatles, Charlie Chaplin, Elton John and Adele.[226][227] In June 2016, she took part in her first magazine shoot for Vogue's centenary issue appearing on the cover.[228] In 2018, Tatler named her on its list of Britain's best dressed people, praising her for \"recycling her looks, rather than wearing them as one-offs\", as well as her use of \"both high street and high-end brands\".[229]\n\nThe \"Kate Middleton effect\"[10][230] is the trend that the Duchess is reported to have had on others in sales of particular products. While Catherine wears items from many new designers, she has also worn dresses by Catherine Walker, who designed many of Diana's favourite evening gowns and day suits.[231] She has worn outfits, hats and ensembles by many other fashion designers.[232][233] The brands she favours are noted in the media.[232][233]\n\nThe Duchess, who attended the 71st British Academy Film Awards, did not participate in Time's Up movement calling for women to wear black on the red carpet.[234] Royal protocol forbids members of the royal family from taking part in political movements but she wore a black sash and carried a black handbag as a variation to the informal black dress code.[235][236] In March 2018, together with the Countess of Wessex, the Duchess hosted the Commonwealth Fashion Exchange reception at Buckingham Palace during 2018 London Fashion Week.[237]\n\nPrivacy and the media\n\nThe death of Diana, Princess of Wales, in Paris while being chased by paparazzi in 1997,[238] influenced the Duke's attitude towards the media.[239] The Duchess and her husband have asked that, when off-duty, their privacy should be respected.[239]\n\nAfter her graduation from university, Middleton was faced with widespread press attention and was often photographed by the paparazzi.[240][241] On 17 October 2005, she complained through her lawyer about harassment from the media, stating she had done nothing significant to warrant publicity.[242] Media attention increased around the time of her 25th birthday in January 2007, prompting warnings from the Prince of Wales, Prince William, and Middleton's lawyers, who threatened legal action. Two newspaper groups, News International, which publishes The Times and The Sun; and the Guardian Media Group, publishers of The Guardian, decided to refrain from publishing paparazzi photographs of her.[243] In 2009, Middleton was awarded \u00a310,000 damages and an apology from the photographic press agency Rex Features Ltd. after she was photographed playing tennis on Christmas Eve while on holiday in Cornwall.[244] In 2010, she pursued an invasion of privacy claim against two agencies and photographer Niraj Tanna, who took photographs of her over Christmas 2009.[245] Middleton obtained a public apology, \u00a35,000 in damages, and legal costs.[246]\n\nIn September 2012, the French edition of Closer and the Italian gossip magazine Chi, published photographs of the Duchess sun-bathing topless while on holiday at the Ch\u00e2teau d'Autet[239] (a private ch\u00e2teau on a 260-ha estate 71 km[247] north of Aix-en-Provence). Analysts from The Times believed the photographs were taken from the D22 (Vaucluse) road half a kilometre from the pool\u2014a distance that would require an 800-mm or a 1000-mm lens.[248] On 17 September 2012, the Duke and Duchess filed a criminal complaint with the French prosecution department and launched a claim for civil damages at the Tribunal de Grande Instance de Nanterre.[249] The following day the courts granted an injunction against Closer, prohibiting further publication of the photographs and announced a criminal investigation would be initiated.[250] Under French law, punitive damages cannot be awarded[251] but intrusions of privacy are a criminal offence carrying a maximum jail sentence of one year and a fine of up to \u20ac45,000 for individuals and \u20ac225,000 for companies.[252][253] In September 2017, Closer was fined \u20ac100,000 and its editor Laurence Pieau and owner Ernesto Mauri were each fined \u20ac45,000.[254]\n\nIn December 2012, two Australian radio hosts, Michael Christian and Mel Greig, called King Edward VII's Hospital where the Duchess was an in-patient for hyperemesis gravidarum. Pretending to be the Queen and the Prince of Wales, Greig and Christian spoke to a nurse on the Duchess's ward, enquiring about her condition. Following a hospital inquiry and a public backlash against the hoax, Jacintha Saldanha, the nurse who put the call through to the ward, committed suicide.[255] The radio hosts subsequently apologised for their actions.[256]\n\nIn February 2013, Chi published the first photos of Catherine's exposed baby bump, taken during her vacation on the private island of Mustique. The British press refused to publish the paparazzi shots.[257] While the Duchess was visiting the Blue Mountains in Sydney, a picture was taken of her bare bottom as her dress blew up. Many newspapers outside the UK published the picture.[258]\n\nOn 14 August 2015, Kensington Palace published a letter detailing what it stated were the \"dangerous\" and invasive efforts of the media to get paparazzi pictures of Prince George and Princess Charlotte. Jason Knauf, communications secretary to the Cambridges, wrote the letter to media standards organisations in various countries.[259]\n\nIn May 2020, Kensington Palace said that the cover story of Tatler magazine titled 'Catherine the Great' contained \"a swathe of inaccuracies and false misrepresentations\". Despite the palace's statement that most of the material was not given to them before publication, the magazine's editor-in-chief announced that he would stand behind the story as the palace had been aware of it for months.[260] In September 2020, after pressure from the couple's lawyers, the magazine removed remarks on the Duchess's family and other similar claims from the online version of the story.[261]\n\nTitles, styles, honours and arms\n\nTitles and styles\n\nRoyal monogram\n\nCatherine is, by marriage, a princess of the United Kingdom and entitled to the style of Royal Highness.[262] She is usually styled as \"Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Cambridge\".[263] When in Scotland, she is known as the Countess of Strathearn.[264] Northern Ireland is represented by a third title, Lady Carrickfergus.[263][a]\n\nHonours\n\nCommonwealth honours\n\nHonorary military appointments\n\nHonorific eponym\n\nAwards\n\nArms\n\nIn September 2013, the Queen granted a conjugal coat of arms to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, consisting of their individual arms displayed side by side, beneath a helm and coronet denoting the duke's status as grandson of the sovereign.[274] Below is shown the earlier grant of the duchess's personal arms, impaled with those of her husband.\n\nAncestry\n\nFour successive generations of the Duchess's ancestors had lived at Potternewton Hall Estate , near Leeds\n\nThe Duchess of Cambridge's father is Michael Middleton, son of Captain Peter Middleton, who, along with their forebears, were from Leeds, Yorkshire.[278][279] Her paternal great-grandmother Olive Middleton (n\u00e9e Lupton) and her cousin Baroness von Schunck (n\u00e9e Kate Lupton) were members of the Lupton family who are described as landed gentry and as such, were invited to the coronation of King George V in 1911.[280][281] Four successive generations of the Duchess's ancestors had lived at Potternewton Hall Estate, the family seat, including the Duchess's great-grandmother Olive Middleton, her father, politician Francis Martineau Lupton, his mother, educator Frances Lupton and her father, epidemiologist Dr Thomas Michael Greenhow.[282][283][284][285][286]\n\nThe Duchess's maternal ancestors, the Harrisons, were working-class labourers and miners from Sunderland and County Durham.[287] Ancestors through her maternal line include Sir Thomas Conyers, 9th Baronet (1731\u20131810), who was a descendant of King Edward IV through his illegitimate daughter Elizabeth Plantagenet.[288] Other paternal ancestors are Sir Thomas Fairfax (1475\u20131520) and his wife Anne Gascoigne, who was a descendant of King Edward III.[289][290]\n\nAuthored articles\n\nNotes\n\n^ Even with the title Lady Carrickfergus, she is still mostly referred to as the Duchess of Cambridge in Northern Ireland, as per given sources.\n\nReferences", "images":
