A new report claims now that they\u2019re both single, \u2018the door is open\u2019 for them to take things to the next level.\n\nIs there a new celebrity romance brewing? A new report from OK! is claiming that things might start heating up between Robert Pattinson, 32, and Sienna Miller, 36. The two actors \u201chave been close for years,\u201d an insider tells the magazine, adding that \u201cthey\u2019ve always had a great connection, but one of them was always with someone else, so it stayed platonic.\u201d However, both of them aren\u2019t currently seeing anyone now. \u201cNow that they\u2019re both single, the door is open for them to give this a real shot,\u201d the source continued.\n\nAs for the pair\u2019s friends, they reportedly think that these two would work really well together. \u201cAll of their mutual friends think Rob and Sienna would be a good match,\u201d the insider said. Rob and Sienna have always seemed pretty close. While promoting their film, The Lost City Of Z at the Berlin International Film Festival in Feb. 2017, the pair looked comfortable together while posing for photos and grabbing dinner together.\n\nThis would definitely be an interesting match though considering Sienna is the one who set the Twilight star up with his ex-fianc\u00e9e FKA twigs. A source told E! News in 2014 that Rob, Sienna and her now ex-fianc\u00e9 Tom Sturridge all went to the singer\u2019s concert together. The Remember Me actor ended up falling in love with Twigs\u2019 music, and the couple introduced the two of them.\n\nHollywoodLife reached out to Rob and Sienna\u2019s reps for comment.", "images": ["https://footwearnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/AP_20329096381069-e1606248495668.jpg?w=230&crop=1", "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Surface-Pro-7.jpg?w=230&crop=1", "https://tvline.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/swat-4x04-1.jpg?w=230&crop=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/sport-bra-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/robert-pattinson_sienna-miller-ftr-1.jpg?w=620", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/robert-pattinson_sienna-miller-ftr-1.jpg", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/courteneylarocca2.jpg?w=48", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/rothys-black-friday-collection-copy.jpg?w=230&crop=1", "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/what-a-free-thanksgiving-dinner-really-means-to-a-family-like-mine.jpg?w=230&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/kelsey-nicole-5-things-to-know-ap-images-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/kourtney-kardashian-and-kylie-jenner-wasted-meme-ap-images-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/robert-pattinson_sienna-miller-ftr-1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Courteney Larocca", "Kimberly Zapata", "Bella Gerard", "Matt Webb Mitovich", "Tim Chan", "Brandt Ranj", "Samantha Mcdonald", "Weekend Editor"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/07/18/are-robert-pattinson-sienna-miller-dating-good-match-relationship/", "title": "Are Robert Pattinson & Sienna Miller Dating?
