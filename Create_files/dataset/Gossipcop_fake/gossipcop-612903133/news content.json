We\u2019ve got EXCLUSIVE details on why she doesn\u2019t mind being a \u2018cougar\u2019 in her next relationship!\n\nIt seems like only yesterday Jennifer Aniston, 49, and Justin Theroux, 46, ended their two year marriage. The couple confirmed their shocking split on Feb. 15, leaving the world devastated. However, being that the Just Go With It actress has had over a month to recover, she\u2019s ready to hit the dating scene. But interestingly, she\u2019s not looking to settle down. \u201cJen doesn\u2019t want to take her next relationship that seriously and just would like to have fun with someone without falling in love. She thinks if she was with a younger guy that she could achieve that because she feels a younger guy doesn\u2019t want to settle down,\u201d a source close to Jennifer tells HollywoodLife EXCLUSIVELY. Good for her, right?\n\n\u201cSo, her eyes aren\u2019t on anyone in particular. But, the ages of the guys she wants is someone in their early thirties for sure. She doesn\u2019t mind being a cougar if need be because its all about the fun,\u201d our source continued. We\u2019re glad to hear Jen is not giving up on dating, especially since Justin wasn\u2019t her first marriage. If you recall, she married Brad Pitt, 54, in a private wedding ceremony in Malibu in 2000, but they split in 2005. And of course you know he went on to marry his Mr. and Mrs. Smith co-star Angelina Jolie. It\u2019s certainly hard to forget.\n\nNevertheless, we think Jen\u2019s idea to date younger guys might be a good idea! After all, it\u2019s worked just fine for Kourtney Kardashian, 38, who\u2019s dating 24-year-old model Younes Bendjima. They\u2019ve been dating for over a year. We can\u2019t wait to see Jennifer\u2019s love life blossom this year, she\u2019s quite a catch!", "images": ["https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/jennifer-aniston-why-shes-looking-for-a-much-younger-man-to-be-her-next-lover-ftr.jpg?w=620", "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Surface-Pro-7.jpg?w=230&crop=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/jennifer-aniston-why-shes-looking-for-a-much-younger-man-to-be-her-next-lover-ftr.jpg", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/sport-bra-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/rothys-black-friday-collection-copy.jpg?w=230&crop=1", "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/what-a-free-thanksgiving-dinner-really-means-to-a-family-like-mine.jpg?w=230&crop=1", "https://tvline.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/seal-team-clay-jason-sonny.jpg?w=230&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/kelsey-nicole-5-things-to-know-ap-images-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://footwearnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/vanessa-hudgens-crop-top-jeans.jpg?w=230&crop=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/kourtney-kardashian-and-kylie-jenner-wasted-meme-ap-images-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/jennifer-aniston-why-shes-looking-for-a-much-younger-man-to-be-her-next-lover-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Robyn Merrett", "Kimberly Zapata", "Bella Gerard", "Matt Webb Mitovich", "Tim Chan", "Brandt Ranj", "Claudia Miller"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/03/22/jennifer-aniston-next-relationship-wants-younger-guy/", "title": "Jennifer Aniston: Why She\u2019s Looking For A Much Younger Man To Be Her Next Lover", "meta_data": {"description": "For Jennifer Aniston's next relationship, she just wants to have fun.
