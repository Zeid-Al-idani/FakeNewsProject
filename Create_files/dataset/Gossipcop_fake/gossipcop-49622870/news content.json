Jen has wanted to have a baby with Justin for years,\" the magazine claimed the friend said.\n\n\"Their baby news came at a bad time in her life, too \u2014 she just lost her mother, and she and Justin almost broke up. But now this surprise pregnancy has turned the worst of times into the best of times.\u201d\n\nAniston's mother, Nancy Dow, died on May 25. She had suffered strokes in 2011 and 2012.\n\nThe magazine published pictures that it claimed showed Aniston had a \"baby bump\".", "images":
