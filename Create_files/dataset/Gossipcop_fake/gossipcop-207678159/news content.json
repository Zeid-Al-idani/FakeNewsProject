The dream team of Body By Simone personal trainer Simone De La Rue and nutritionist Kelly LeVeque \u2014 whose client list includes the likes of Jennifer Garner, Emmy Rossum, Jessica Alba and Molly Sims \u2014 have just released an app that gives users access to their expertise for a very nominal monthly fee.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just an app stuffed with content \u2014 more than 900 minutes of video and hundreds of recipes \u2014 that leaves users to their own devices to navigate and motivate. For $19.99/month, the platform actually uses artificial intelligence software to create customized workout plans and nutrition programs for each individual, taking into consideration their specific goals. It tracks progress via measurements and weekly photos, and reminds users via push notifications to work out. \u201cIt is programmed to provide the customization of a personal workout with me,\u201d says De La Rue, adding, \u201cThis has never been done before in a fitness app.\u201d\n\nBut while it may seem the app approach speaks only to the general population, De La Rue says hers and LeVeque\u2019s celebrity clients are \u201cvery excited, especially as they are often on set or traveling. They can have their dream team in their pocket.\u201d The impetus for the app was a desire to have a platform available to anyone in the world, since the Aussie trainer on E\u2019s Revenge Body can\u2019t be everywhere at once. For a more 360-degree approach, she wanted to include a nutritionist, and because of their several shared clients (Garner and Rossum among them) and complementary beliefs and philosophies, LeVeque was the ideal fit.\n\nWhen it comes to nutrition, protein and plants are at the core. Recipes run the gamut and might include Jen Garner\u2019s Chocolate Blueberry #fab4smoothie, with collagen, almond butter, spinach, flax and other nutritious ingredients. Says LeVeque of their approach: \u201cProtein ups collagen, muscle tone and metabolism. Fat benefits hormones, skin and cellular health and does not store as fat as simple carbs do. Fiber for gut microbiome proliferation and detoxification, and greens or veggies deep in color to fight inflammation.\u201d These \u201cfab four\u201d foods are at the core of her recipes.\n\nThe workouts mix up methodology to keep things interesting, and never use props so they can be done literally anywhere. De La Rue\u2019s favorite currently: dance cardio. \u201cIt\u2019s an incredible workout, burns calories, teaches you coordination, challenges your brain to learn choreography and it\u2019s fun and joyous,\u201d she says. The pair\u2019s one-stop-shop app also doles out motivational words and advice, since that\u2019s key to many people\u2019s success with a new wellness plan.\n\nLeVeque suggests users get up and exercise first thing in the morning, since a fasted workout has the same benefits as intermittent fasting, which causes a surge in human growth hormone and testosterone to help burn fat. Additionally, she advocates for early dinners, before dark \u2014 which seems decidedly un-Hollywood but has very Hollywood ramifications. \u201cAn early dinner allows for the body to digest the meal, balance blood sugar and clear excess insulin before you head to bed,\u201d says LeVeque, \u201cso you can benefit from a fat-burning, belt-shrinking night of sleep!\u201d We see why Garner and Rossum swear by these ladies.", "images": ["http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7395269&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://static.hollywoodreporter.com/sites/default/files/2018/04/screen_shot_2018-04-09_at_10.40.35_am_2_-_h_2018-928x523.jpg", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/assets/1606142862/images/brand/writerimage-thr.jpg?5de16d88930168405795", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/assets/1606142862/images/brand/thr-logo-white.svg?5de16d88930168405795", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/assets/1606142862/images/brand/favicon.ico?5de16d88930168405795"], "top_img": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/assets/1606142862/images/brand/favicon.ico?5de16d88930168405795", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kathryn Romeyn", "Thrnews Thr.Com"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/jennifer-garners-trainer-launches-wellness-app-called-bbs-1101013", "title": "Jennifer Garner's Trainer Launched a Wellness App That Uses Artificial Intelligence", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "sailthru.title": "Jennifer Garner's Trainer Launched a Wellness App That Uses Artificial Intelligence", "sailthru.description": "Celeb-beloved Body By Simone founder Simone De La Rue and nutritionist-to-the-stars Kelly LeVeque collaborated on BBS, using artificial intelligence to customize fitness and nutrition programs for users.", "sailthru.author": "Kathryn Romeyn", "sailthru.vertical": "Style", "sailthru.date": "2018-04-09 10:51:38"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1523263898.0, "source": "http://www.hollywoodreporter.com", "summary": ""}
