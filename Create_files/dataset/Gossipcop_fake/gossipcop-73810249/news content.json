They\u2019re hoping for a \u2018long life together,\u2019 a new report claims!\n\nJelena seems to be on the fast track to a happily ever after! Justin Bieber, 23, and Selena Gomez, 25, are looking to buy their first home together, Life & Style reports. \u201cIt was Selena\u2019s idea, and Justin is all for it,\u201d a source tells the mag. \u201cHe\u2019s already looking at homes in the Calabasas, CA area. They just can\u2019t wait to start their life together.\u201d\n\nThe mag alleges that purchasing their first home together \u201cis the beginning of what they hope will be a very long life together.\u201d The source points out that the pair are completely different than they were back when their relationship wasn\u2019t the best. \u201cThey\u2019ve both grown up so much. Being apart was crucial for them to move on and to realize they were meant to be together.\u201d Ultimately, \u201cbuying a home to live in as a couple will seal the deal.\u201d\n\nAlthough Justin and Selena are clearly happy, as seen in photos from their most recent outing, not everyone is shipping the pair. Selena\u2019s family, who were there for her after the couple\u2019s 2015 split, are reportedly concerned for her well being. \u201cThey want Selena to remain healthy,\u201d the source says of her family\u2019s opinions. As you may know, Selena suffers from the auto immune disease lupus, and underwent a lifesaving kidney transplant over the summer. \u201cNow, her family feels \u201cthis could be the biggest mistake of her life.\u201d\n\nJelena shocked the world, and nearly broke the internet, when they reunited at her CA home in late October. However, the pair were not alone. They spent hours on end inside her home with mutual friends. Selena was still dating The Weeknd, 27, at the time of her reunion with the Biebs. However, the pair split just days after. What timing? \u2026\n\nAnd, that first Jelena hangout was the start of many others to come. Justin and Selena have been inseparable ever since \u2014 Being photographed on sweet strolls through CA, riding bikes, out to romantic meals and attending church services. Interesting enough, we may have seen them together more times in the past few weeks than in their entire relationship\u2026 and that began in 2009. So, you can infer that they\u2019ve been hanging out A LOT.\n\nThe couple or non-couple [they have yet to confirm], were most recently spotted out on a sweet stroll in LA on Nov. 13. A fan caught Jelena walking through what appeared to be a local park. Now, reports are claiming that Justin is patiently waiting for Sel to make him her boyfriend. Do you think she will?\n\nHollywoodLifers, how do you feel about Jelena\u2019s reunion?", "images": ["https://tvline.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/virgin-river-season-1-recap-mel.jpg?w=230&crop=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/jenna_lemoncelli.jpg?w=48", "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Surface-Pro-7.jpg?w=230&crop=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/jelena-ftr1.jpg", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/sport-bra-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/rothys-black-friday-collection-copy.jpg?w=230&crop=1", "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/what-a-free-thanksgiving-dinner-really-means-to-a-family-like-mine.jpg?w=230&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/kelsey-nicole-5-things-to-know-ap-images-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://footwearnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/vanessa-hudgens-crop-top-jeans.jpg?w=230&crop=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/kourtney-kardashian-and-kylie-jenner-wasted-meme-ap-images-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/jelena-ftr1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jenna Lemoncelli", "Kimberly Zapata", "Bella Gerard", "Andy Swift", "Tim Chan", "Brandt Ranj", "Claudia Miller", "News Editor"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2017/11/15/are-justin-bieber-selena-gomez-moving-in-together-buying-home-reunited-relationship/", "title": "Justin Bieber & Selena Gomez Reportedly Moving In Together One Month After Reuniting", "meta_data": {"description": "Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez are reportedly shopping around for a home in California weeks after reuniting!", "news_keywords": "Justin Bieber, Selena Gomez", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1400650284", "generator": "WordPress 5.5.2", "author": "Jenna Lemoncelli", "theme-color": "#fff", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-touch-fullscreen": "YES", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Hollywood Life", "application-name": "Hollywood Life", "fb": {"pages": 94724837471}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "onesignal": "wordpress-plugin", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Justin Bieber & Selena Gomez Reportedly Moving In Together One Month After Reuniting", "url": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2017/11/15/are-justin-bieber-selena-gomez-moving-in-together-buying-home-reunited-relationship/", "description": "First comes love, then comes real estate? \u2014 Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez are reportedly shopping around for a home in CA, weeks after reuniting!
