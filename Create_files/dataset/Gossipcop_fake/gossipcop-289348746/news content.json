It\u2019s not fair to them.\n\n\u201cI did my last tour because I had this unexpected life crisis and then the music came pouring out of me from that,\u201d Stefani explained. \u201cIt was such a lifesaver and a beautiful moment for me to be able to write again. I put that tour on at the last minute and went on a summer tour with the kids. It was so much fun for them, they loved it. But it isn\u2019t realistic.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Hollaback\u201d girl confessed her career is winding down following the release of This Is What the Truth Feels Like in 2016, her first album in 10 years.\n\nRELATED: Gwen Stefani Reveals Fun Fact About Blake Shelton\u2019s Ex-Girlfriend\n\n\u201cI\u2019m obviously at the end of my journey of being a musician\u2026 because of my age, and I\u2019ve been doing it for thirty-something years,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s perfect for me to be able to do a Vegas show because not only does it work for me as a mom, but it also works creatively.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a way to express myself and do my whole catalogue of the music that defines every time period in my life; all the crises and all the joys.\u201d\n\nStefani also dished on the artists that inspire and make her better. Two such names are Jennifer Lopez and Stefani\u2019s boyfriend Blake Shelton.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always looked up to her [Lopez] in the sense that we\u2019re exactly the same age and I remember when No Doubt was first coming out and she hadn\u2019t done \u2018Jenny from The Block\u2019 yet, but she had that song out, \u2018Waiting for Tonight\u2019,\u201d Stefani recalled. \u201cAt the time I was working with Prince and he started comparing me and Jennifer.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t even see how I was in the same category with her,\u201d she revealed. \u201cShe was Jennifer Lopez and I was in a band called No Doubt (laughs). But now here we are both doing these residencies all these years later, and we\u2019ve known each other through the years. She\u2019s always invited me to her kids\u2019 birthday parties and things like that. She is a crazy work[horse].\u201d\n\nSpeaking of JLo\u2019s Vegas residency, Stefani paid close attention to how the \u201cOn The Floor\u201d singer crafted her shows.\n\n\u201cI was studying the production of her show. The show was incredible, and she works so hard on stage,\u201d explained Stefani. \u201cWhen I came backstage to talk to her afterwards, she comes out of the dressing room looking like a Barbie doll. She was breathtaking on stage, but when you see her up close, it\u2019s like, \u2018What?! It\u2019s not possible. You are so gorgeous!'\u201d\n\nRELATED: Blake Shelton Admits He \u2018Thinks About\u2019 Marrying Gwen Stefani\n\nWhen practising a performance or putting pen to paper, it helps to have a veteran singer-songwriter on standby. Fortunately for Stefani, her country crooning beau is just that.\n\n\u201cObviously, he\u2019s my best friend, so I\u2019m bouncing stuff off him all the time,\u201d she said of Shelton. \u201cHe\u2019s one of those people in my life that\u2019s super supportive and gets me motivated. There\u2019s a whole bunch of songs about him in the show, so that\u2019s fun.\n\n\u201cLike anybody with their best friend, we share everything together. I\u2019ll tell him, \u2018I picked my dancers! There were 500 girls that tried out!\u2019 and I\u2019ll send him videos.\u201d\n\nGwen Stefani\u2019s upcoming Las Vegas residency, Just a Girl, begins June 27 at the Zappos Theater at Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino.", "images": ["https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/SHERYL-CROWE-FEATURE.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=387&h=258&crop=1", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/CP2691740.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=387&h=258&crop=1", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/holidays-340x150.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=340&h=150&crop=1", "https://i1.wp.com/media.globaltv.com/videostatic/vms/io5nt57abp-v20rznzw3n/ETCRAWDavidBoreanazDirectingSealTeam.png?w=145&h=97&quality=60", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Chrissy-Teigen-Meghan-Markle-.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=145&h=97&crop=1", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/etcanada-blue.png?w=82", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/126454166_805633713558733_372629643599970962_n.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=145&h=97&crop=1", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/CP11947567.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=387&h=258&crop=1", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/the-raconteurs.png?w=720&h=480&crop=1", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/etcanada-blue.png?w=90", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GettyImages-1269758199.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&crop=0px%2C0px%2C3999px%2C2674px&resize=145%2C97", "https://i1.wp.com/media.globaltv.com/videostatic/vms/gywo2mgz9l-h4bmk5fp5q/ETC112520DrewBarrymoreKellyRowland.png?w=145&h=97&quality=60", "https://i1.wp.com/media.globaltv.com/videostatic/vms/kia2b3ln6k-v72zcyed1x/ETC112520_Saved_By_The_Bell_BTS_S1.png?w=145&h=97&quality=60", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/themes/shaw-et-canada/img/logos/global.png", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/gwenstefa.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=720&h=480&crop=1", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/themes/shaw-et-canada/img/newsletter/newsletter-large.jpg", "https://i1.wp.com/media.globaltv.com/videostatic/vms/78ubj7qen4-9eckykqje6/ETC112520KaleyCuocoTheFlightAttendantAPTN_YOUTUBE01.png?w=145&h=97&quality=60", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/awards-banner-350x150.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=340&h=150&crop=1", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/CP15900923-e1606241167375.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=145&h=97&crop=1", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/vip-helpers/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png", "https://i0.wp.com/media.globaltv.com/videostatic/vms/zp56n1z0zj-0v6sp0yywu/A09_Saved_By_The_Bell_Fashion.Consolidated.01.png?w=145&h=97&quality=60", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/pride-340x150-1.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=340&h=150&crop=1", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/themes/shaw-et-canada/img/logos/corus.png", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/themes/shaw-et-canada/img/logos/ad-choices.png"], "top_img": "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/gwenstefa.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=720&h=480&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Shakiel Mahjouri"], "canonical_link": "https://etcanada.com/news/330123/gwen-stefani-admits-im-obviously-at-the-end-of-my-journey-of-being-a-musician/", "title": "Gwen Stefani Admits \u2018I\u2019m Obviously At The End Of My Journey Of Being A Musician\u2019", "meta_data": {"google-site-verification": "x4SpOp2Us67I6MlQN2uFse9KXvwgu1d8_r5F2qkIbYc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "generator": "WordPress 5.5.2", "title": "Gwen Stefani Admits \u2018I\u2019m Obviously At The End Of My Journey Of Being A Musician\u2019", "author": "Shakiel Mahjouri", "description": "For Gwen Stefani, her new Las Vegas residency is a lifesaver.
