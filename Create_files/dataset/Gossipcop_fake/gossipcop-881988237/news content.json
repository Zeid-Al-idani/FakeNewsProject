Celebrity Q&A\u2019s are ultimately all about the questions, and Ferber asked some fabulous ones.\n\nAt one point, Gerber picked up on George\u2019s observation that George Michael was once the \u201cKarma Chameleon\u201d singer\u2019s nemesis, exhorting the performer to \u201cbe Justin Bieber\u2018s nemesis!\u201d Prompting this reply:\n\n\u201cNo, he doesn\u2019t need me to be his nemesis. He\u2019s his own nemesis! I feel kind of sorry for him. He\u2019s a kid. Who\u2019s taking care of him? That\u2019s the question I want to ask. Who\u2019s taking care of this child? He\u2019s clearly in a bad place, so I don\u2019t want to slag him off. I think he\u2019s beautiful, a beautiful boy. Let\u2019s not pretend here. He\u2019s a beautiful boy.\u201d \u201cHe looks like a beautiful dyke. I kind of like that \u2014 the whole dykey, androgynous thing he\u2019s got going on. But I feel like everyone\u2019s giving him a hard time and, yes, he\u2019s slightly out of control. Somebody [should] step in.\u201d\n\nWe also have to hand it to Ferber for having the guts to ask Boy George if he\u2019s tried Grindr! BG\u2019s answer: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to go out with somebody who puts their penis on an App.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.adweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/LiveRamp_Webinar_120420.gif", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 190 275'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "http://www.adweek.com/digital/boy-george-pays-justin-bieber-a-backhanded-compliment/ https:/www.adweek.com/wp-content/plugins/aw-social-share-widget/images/baseline_close_black_48dp.png ", "https://www.adweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Wildbrain_Brandshare_112720_HP_V2-640x360.jpg", "https://www.adweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Steelhouse_Webinar_121420.gif", "https://www.adweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Amobee_Webinar_121720_V2.gif", "http://www.adweek.com/digital/boy-george-pays-justin-bieber-a-backhanded-compliment/ https:/www.adweek.com/wp-content/plugins/aw-social-share-widget/images/f_logo_RGB-Blue_58.png ", "https://www.adweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/CleverTap_Webinar_121020.gif", "https://www.adweek.com/wp-content/themes/adweek-next/src/images/global/adweek-header-wt.png", "https://www.adweek.com/wp-content/themes/adweek-next/src/images/icons/menu-24px.svg", "http://www.adweek.com/digital/boy-george-pays-justin-bieber-a-backhanded-compliment/ https:/www.adweek.com/wp-content/plugins/aw-social-share-widget/images/LI-In-Bug.png", "https://www.adweek.com/wp-content/themes/adweek-next/src/images/icons/close-24px-hover.svg", "https://www.adweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Facebook_PE_111620_HP-640x360.jpg", "https://www.adweek.com/fishbowlny/files/2014/03/BoyGeorgePromoPic.jpg", "http://www.adweek.com/digital/boy-george-pays-justin-bieber-a-backhanded-compliment/ https:/www.adweek.com/wp-content/plugins/aw-social-share-widget/images/twitter-circle.png", "http://www.adweek.com/digital/boy-george-pays-justin-bieber-a-backhanded-compliment/ https:/www.adweek.com/wp-content/plugins/aw-social-share-widget/images/messenger_logo_color.png", "https://www.adweek.com/wp-content/themes/adweek-next/src/images/icons/search-24px.svg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "https://www.adweek.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2014/03/JustinBieberRSCover.jpg", "http://www.adweek.com/digital/boy-george-pays-justin-bieber-a-backhanded-compliment/ https:/www.adweek.com/wp-content/plugins/aw-social-share-widget/images/baseline_print_black_48dp.png", "http://www.adweek.com/digital/boy-george-pays-justin-bieber-a-backhanded-compliment/ https:/www.adweek.com/wp-content/plugins/aw-social-share-widget/images/baseline_email_black_48dp.png", "https://www.adweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Criteo_Immersive_091520_LandingPage_HP_Static_1-640x360.jpg", "https://www.adweek.com/wp-content/themes/adweek-next/src/images/global/logo-black.png", "https://www.adweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/RHBioPic.jpg", "https://www.adweek.com/wp-content/themes/adweek-next/src/images/icons/close-24px.svg", "http://www.adweek.com/digital/boy-george-pays-justin-bieber-a-backhanded-compliment/ https:/www.adweek.com/wp-content/themes/adweek-next/src/images/icons/premium-icon-only.svg", "https://www.adweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Smartly_Brandshare_112420_HP-640x360.png", "https://www.adweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IBM_Webinar_121620.gif"], "top_img": "https://www.adweek.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2014/03/JustinBieberRSCover.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["March"], "canonical_link": "https://www.adweek.com/digital/boy-george-pays-justin-bieber-a-backhanded-compliment/", "title": "Boy George Pays Justin Bieber a \u2018Beautiful\u2019 Backhanded Compliment", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "follow, index", "generator": "WordPress 5.5.1", "wp-parsely_version": "2.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.adweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/246x0w.png", "lytics": {"topics": "aw:fishbowl"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@adweek", "title": "Boy George Pays Justin Bieber a 'Beautiful' Backhanded Compliment", "creator": "@hollywoodspin", "image": "https://www.adweek.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2014/03/JustinBieberRSCover.jpg"}, "fb": {"admins": "34404791,617231194", "pages": 126756847074, "app_id": 329778260413541}, "og": {"title": "Boy George Pays Justin Bieber a 'Beautiful' Backhanded Compliment", "url": "https://www.adweek.com/digital/boy-george-pays-justin-bieber-a-backhanded-compliment/", "type": "article", "image": "https://www.adweek.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2014/03/JustinBieberRSCover.jpg"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=570229326", "theme-color": "#000"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.adweek.com", "summary": ""}
