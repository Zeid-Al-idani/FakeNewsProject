Referencing Swift\u2019s long rumored feud with Katy Perry he wrote on Twitter, \u201cI know you\u2019re off tour and you need someone new to try and bury like Katy ETC but I\u2019m not that guy, sorry...\u201d\n\nThen, Swift slammed Kanye West at the Grammys for his lyrics to \u201cFamous,\u201d in which he rapped about her \u201cI made that bitch famous.\u201d At the Grammys, Swift cautioned her fans about \u201cpeople\u2026 who try to undercut your success or take credit for\u2026 your fame.\" West insisted he\u2019d had the pop star\u2019s permission to include her in his song, and in July, Kim Kardashian was ready to prove it. She released a recording of Swift speaking with West, approving of her name being used on the track.\n\nThe incidents left Swift fans wondering if the starlet was secretly a celebrity mean girl.\n\nSince then, however, she has avoided controversy and done charity work that likely has her back in the good graces of the Twitterverse.\n\n", "images":
