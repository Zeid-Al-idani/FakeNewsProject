appeared in court to hear a judge rule in her favour.\n\nThe American pop star, who has already adopted two Malawian children and has a biological son and daughter, has seen her adoption request approved after attending court in person.\n\nThe children, previously reported to be twin girls named Stella and Esther, could leave Malawi with the singer shortly after spending the last two years in the Home of Hope in Mchinji.\n\nTheir father was in court to observe proceedings, while their mother is understood to have died a week after giving birth in 2012 from caesarian section complications.\n\nThe twins will join David and Mercy, the two children previously adopted into the US by Madonna amid some controversy.\n\nJudiciary spokesman Mlenga Mvula has now confirmed that Madonna had been granted an adoption order by Justice Fiona Mwale.", "images":
