Shelton was caught stocking up on spirits while Stefani was out of town.\n\n\u201aI do \u2026 want another drink? Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton\u2019s wedding plans could be on hold, RadarOnline.com has learned, after the No Doubt front woman asked her fiance to put down the bottle \u2014 and he headed to the liquor store!\n\nShelton recently dropped 85 pounds on Stefani\u2019s no-booze wedding diet, according to an insider. But then, late last month, he was caught leaving an L.A. liquor store with enough swill to soak Skid Row for a month.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the bad boy launched his booze-buying spree just hours after Stefani, 47, chatted it up with late-night TV host Seth Meyers 2,500 miles away in New York City!\n\n\u201cWhen Gwen is away, Blake seems to play! Or, at the very least, take a few cheat days,\u201d a source told Radar.\n\nShelton\u2019s box bulged with multiple bottles of tequila, and was packed so tightly that even the burly 40-year-old struggled to carry it only a few feet to his car!\n\nAs Radar has reported, the country stud has long loved the lush life. Stefani proved to be a calming influence after they hooked up in November 2015, but the source said that Shelton is ready to get rowdy again.\n\nSaid one insider, \u201cThe wedding can\u2019t come soon enough for Blake!\u201d\n\nWe pay for juicy info!
