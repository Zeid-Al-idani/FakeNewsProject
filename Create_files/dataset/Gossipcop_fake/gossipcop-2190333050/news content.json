Travis Scott, 26, however, was another story! HollywoodLife.com learned EXCLUSIVELY that Kris always had concerns about Travis, but fortunately for everyone involved, her fears have yet to become a reality. More than that though, she\u2019s actually impressed by how well the rapper has adapted to parenthood! Click here to see cute pics of Kylie and Travis together.\n\n\u201cKris knew Kylie was meant to be a mother and would do a great job, but Kris was skeptical about Travis, she just doesn\u2019t know him that well,\u201d a source close to the Kardashians shared with us. \u201cSo Kris is keeping a close eye on Travis and has been pleasantly surprised and impressed with how well he is taking to fatherhood.\u201d Baby Stormi was only born on Feb. 1, but so far, Travis has been very present in her life. In addition, he\u2019s also reportedly been hugely supportive of Kylie, and they\u2019ve been getting along better than ever.\n\n\u201cHe is taking great care of Stormi and being good to Kylie at the same time,\u201d our insider explained. \u201cKris is in contact with Kylie all day, every day making sure the new mom has everything she needs while also making sure Travis is treating her well. So far, so good \u2014 Stormi, Kylie, and Travis all seem to be happy, which is great for Kris who will continue to keep a close eye on her family.\u201d\n\nSince becoming new parents, Kylie and Travis have been able to enjoy some alone time together in the form of a quick vacay. Just earlier this month, the couple were photographed together in Miami, and they were even seen relaxing in the sunshine on a boat with friends. But although Kylie is apparently happy with the way things are going, she\u2019s not quite ready to settle down with Travis just YET.\n\nIn fact, during their getaway, as HollywoodLife.com previously reported, the artist spontaneously asked Kylie to marry him, and she turned him down. \u201cKylie definitely wants to marry Travis, but she also really loves how things are the way they are,\u201d another insider shared with us EXCLUSIVELY last week. \u201cShe knows she rushed into this relationship, so she\u2019s trying to slow it all down and enjoy every single stage.\u201d", "images": ["https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/lori-harvey-michael.b-jordan-spotted-ap-ftr-1.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/k-beauty.gif?w=230&crop=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/kris-jenner-travis-scott-stormi-ftr.jpg", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Megan-Thee-Stallion-Admits-She-Has-\u2018Chemistry-With-DaBaby-ap-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/christina-milian-one-piece-swimsuit-splashnews-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/macys-parade-going-virtual.jpg?w=230&crop=1", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://footwearnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/dollar-tree-store.jpg?w=230&crop=1", "https://tvline.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/the-prom-movie-trailer.jpg?w=230&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ols5-092119-4402-a-7-1.jpg?w=230&crop=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/kathleen-harper.jpg?w=43"], "top_img": "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/kris-jenner-travis-scott-stormi-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kathleen Harper", "Reshma Gopaldas", "Elizabeth Denton", "Andy Swift", "Claire Shaffer", "Sheena Butler-Young", "Celebrity Baeditor"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/03/13/kris-jenner-impressed-travis-scott-stepping-up-baby-daddy-stormi/", "title": "Kris Jenner \u2018Impressed\u2019 By How Travis Scott Is Stepping Up & Taking Care Of Stormi & Kylie", "meta_data": {"description": "While Kris Jenner was skeptical at 1st about Travis Scott's ability to be a good dad &amp; partner, she's been pleasantly surprised in a big way!", "news_keywords": "Kris Jenner, Kylie Jenner, Stormi Webster, Travis Scott", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1400650284", "generator": "WordPress 5.5.2", "author": "Kathleen Harper", "theme-color": "#fff", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-touch-fullscreen": "YES", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Hollywood Life", "application-name": "Hollywood Life", "fb": {"pages": 94724837471}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "onesignal": "wordpress-plugin", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Kris Jenner \u2018Impressed\u2019 By How Travis Scott Is Stepping Up & Taking Care Of Stormi & Kylie", "url": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/03/13/kris-jenner-impressed-travis-scott-stepping-up-baby-daddy-stormi/", "description": "While Kris Jenner was skeptical at 1st about Travis Scott\u2019s ability to be a good dad & partner, HL learned exclusively, she\u2019s been pleasantly surprised in a big way!", "site_name": "Hollywood Life", "image": {"identifier": "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/kris-jenner-travis-scott-stormi-ftr.jpg", "width": 620, "height": 350, "alt": "Kris Jenner and Travis Scott"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-03-13T16:44:29+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-03-13T23:21:43+00:00"}, "twitter": {"text": {"title": "Kris Jenner \u2018Impressed\u2019 By How Travis Scott Is Stepping Up & Taking Care Of Stormi & Kylie"}, "image": {"identifier": "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/kris-jenner-travis-scott-stormi-ftr.jpg?w=620", "alt": "Kris Jenner and Travis Scott"}, "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@HollywoodLife", "title": "Kris Jenner \u2018Impressed\u2019 By How Travis Scott Is Stepping Up & Taking Care Of Stormi & Kylie", "description": "While Kris Jenner was skeptical at 1st about Travis Scott's ability to be a good dad & partner, she's been pleasantly surprised in a big way!"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=128"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1520895600.0, "source": "http://hollywoodlife.com", "summary": ""}
